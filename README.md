# YouTube Downloader & Text Transcriber

This program will be able to download youtube videos using youtube-dl and ffmpeg, then transcribe them using the SpeechRecognition python library. Specifically, Google Speech Recognition is used.

## Usage

1. Run the download_yt.py file and change the url to the YouTube video you want to download
2. Run transcribe_audio.py to get the transcripts.

## Work to be Done

I'd like to turn this project into a search engine for one of my favorite YouTubers, Ali Abdaal. The idea is to have a searchable database that anyone can look up specific words and it will be able to find videos where he said those words.

Progress is being tracked with GitHub Issues and a kanban board in the Projects tab of this repo.
