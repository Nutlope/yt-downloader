 hey guys welcome back to the Baymont tip series my name is Ali and in this video we're going to be talking about section three everyone gets worried about section three because it's it's billed as rising costs is a say that you have to write but I was probably too easy explaining the tips and tactics on how to do well in Section 3 and how to prepare for it about space and scoring the two s's and then we're going to go on to talk about some Section 3 and on the day of the exam score in Section 3 space you really don't have much space to write on this is what the answer she looks like as you'll see it's pretty much in a full page but the top quarter of it is taken up with your name and headlight number to Radio you have to write on all three causes of us for the full size of April cuz that border around the edges but you know a lot to right outside of so what we always recommend is that instead of thinking of Section 3 as as like an essay instead think of it as just writing three paragraphs because really you only have room the Wright 3 apple pie graph in that school books that they give you and I think thinking about it as running a few paragraphs makes it much more psychologically manageable than thinking about it as an essay because I say so scary I see you got a number out of five like 1 2 3 4 5 or like a point five in the middle of that and you get a grade so ABCD or E the number is basically the content of your essay when you have a letter the letters the grammatical spelling punctuation stuff most people get a for grandmothers some people get be a very small minority Cassie and if you want a d or heat you really have to try hard to activity screw things up cuz it really is quite hard to get a d or an e-4 Grandma USA is marked by to examine Domino's 10 to be graduate students at Cambridge each year we get the email from the emissions testing service saying would you like to Mark Bina essays and you get paid like an hour and they give yous averaged out but it doesn't even if discrepancy in Mark's between two examiners like one gives you a 5A and one gives you a 2d then the senior exam to mock sat and that kind of add some element of a safety to this otherwise fairly subjective help with marking to be my essay 3 is pretty pretty reasonable 4 and 5 of Pretty Good most people get an A or B for the grandma thing so I mean from what I understand what universities use a cup of maybe about 2.5 see so as long as you get the three CR above then you're pretty fine and actually together three all you really have to do is answer the question I have provided you answer the question chances are you will get at least a 3 and then if you use like nice language and explain 0.93 that's what gets you into the 4th and 5 what we talked about space you don't have much of it and we talked about scoring let's not talk about tactics on how to prepare Section 3 section 3 you get half an hour and you have to write one of four possible essay titles one of those titles of using a question like you might be should we iOffer treatments to appease people under the NHS or it might be something about you that so I think I cat euthanasia or like that kind of thing play some kind of Cardiff s topic so am I your I think it was about freedom and Liberties and I think one year that was asking about education policies and stuff like that and the fourth one is usually some kind of quote by nature or Aristotle Socrates or someone famous and you have to interpret the quote and kind of answer the sub-questions associated with a question or statement and then you have three or four sometimes 2L sub questions provided you answer all of the sub questions you will almost certainly get at least at 3 if you fail to address any of the sub-questions the highest Mach they can give you the two so the one sure way of completely destroying your section 3 paper is by not answering one of the questions so please don't do that please make sure that you answer everything aspect of the question that you've chosen okay so how did you the question this is also an interesting topic we always recommend that you spent at least 2 or 3 minutes activity deciding which question to do it's very easy In the Heat of the exam you know it's you just on section 2 the super-secret I'm pressured you ready set up a section 2 and you think oh crap I didn't have any time in section 2 therefore need to rush into Section 3 please don't do this Section 3 is not very time pressure that's all you got half an hour and in fact the only take about 10-15 minutes to write in that box more choose your question wisely what I would recommend is that after we go through each of the essay titles and just kind of thinking your head right what point do I have to dressy to be so some points and then they take the one that you have the most things to say for in terms of choosing a question there is no benefit to choosing a weird question over a normal question so I mean some people that I've spoken to over the past few years seem to think that I do if I choose the weird quote by Aristotle then the examiners will look at me more favorably because ever answering the question about medical ethics but no one's going to answer that question completely ignore that type of thinking just take the question that you think you can dance the best examiner's don't care which one you answer and it's much better for you if you want to the easier question and get the marks on it then if you try Macklemore difficult question just because it seems more difficult so at this point we're about 2 minutes into a Section 3 paper we put 28 minutes ago and we decided what question were going to do the next step of Section 3 is to replant RSA very well. 18 minutes planning my essay planning is by far the most important part of Section 3 what you want to do if you want to the point where you know exactly what you're going to write when you finally put pen to paper and it's an onion like making stuff up as you go along places that you only really have one shot about section three on two sheets of the rules have changed in recent times but previously they were only ever allowed to give you one sheet and if you screwed up. Shaped and that was the end of it so what we always say his treat this onto sheet as if it's sacred touch it at all until you've already planned USA and you know exactly what you going to do in terms of the planning stage we recommend splitting up into two parts number one is the brain dump face and then the two of the organization phase to the brain don't phase where you'd like I mean let's say the S8 obese people should be treated under the NHS because it's a southern Fix condition something like that the subsections might be explain a reason for everything a reason against on to give your own thoughts so we can split up a paper nicely into three sections we go for we go again so in the brain that face I would just be writing as many points as I can possibly think of for the for for the against and kind of workout what conclusion I want to go from here say the budget of the entrance is around 210 billion but this isn't enough because Cancer drugs and having fun today and he's being closed down that would have been to the point of you making it that we have limited resources but then I'll be kind of expanding on it with maybe one or two extra bits of information and that would turn it from like maybe a three essay intro for essay for example so this up as many points as we can and then an organization face which took should take a few minutes we pretty much pick one or two points from each section that we're going to because if you don't have the space to write any more than that and an essay like we should treat a v people under the NHS is a long-ass day and I'm sure you'd love to write losing those about it but you only have these three or four paragraphs so you got to pick your best points and think about how they're going to flow together SSA for example I might be like a my introduction is going to be this afternoon production I'm going to say one reason in favor of not treating of these people is that the visit is often regarded as a self-inflicted condition given the limited resources of the NHL seems unfair to use funds for the treatment of a self-inflicted condition when those funds could instead be used to fund cancer treatment 02 fun to genetic pediatric cases things like that and then argue against this I might say that have treatment under the NHS as anyone else because they pay taxes and because the NHS was founded on the principle of free healthcare at the point of need if I have space I might do one more of each and then I'll conclude by saying in conclusion I believe that. And I would have this kind of in my head and paper during my organization phase of the planning so this point we still haven't put pen-to-paper we still haven't written anything on a 1/2 sheet we're just kind of actively very very detailed planning RSA because we've got loads of time so that's the planning phase of Section 3 the writing face if you go to put pen to paper and write in really small really neat handwriting on this onto page this morning you right pretty much the better it is because you can put more points in and I can give you a more marks if you're up very untidily that's bad because read it and you just want to really make an effort to try writing as neatly as possible if you're the type of person whose handwriting is atrocious then give yourself a bit more time for the writing spend a bit a little bit less time of the timing because it needs you can make your handwriting the better it'll be for you one thing I always recommend preparing for Section 3 is that you should practice 123 timed essays in advance Lipozene before the exam and you should print off that answer grid that's on the beam at on the official FEMA website I'll put it in tableau that'll be able to see exactly how much space you but the writing so when you do the song that says you write it on that piece of paper and you time how long it takes you personally to write very small really need and to fill that Gap fill that space so when I was doing it and it took me about 12:30 what's the right way to small wedding in that space so that means I could have 50 minutes planning to music using a question and maybe sometime left over again for checking if I was a big Quake on the writing front so yeah what you guys should do when preparing the section 3 do a couple of time to essays time how long it takes and that box and use that time to work out how much time you got available to planning for checking in for choosing a question Vicki useful to check through the essay make sure you got everything sorted make sure you haven't accidentally put a knot in your confusion which would completely change the meaning of USA however we do want to be avoiding doing the whole Crossing and asterixis and that that kind of thing you was a contrite please turn over and write on the back because it's only the front of the sheets against guns and it's just not very nice brick Domino's to have to kind of interpret schooling than astrix and stuff so he can avoid it than that would be ideal but of course if you're in danger of question like if you go to the end of the essay and you'd like oh crap I haven't read my conclusion and that was one of the things I was being off then yes of course you need to do whatever it takes to get that confusion in that because if you don't have a conclusion on the question asked you to write a conclusion then you're going to get to I-25 we wouldn't want that in your checking phase just make sure everything is everything is in order and above will make sure you answer the question because that's the most important thing and actually if you only take away one thing from this video is that please answer the question if it has three subsections that you have good rest please address free subsection if you do that and write reasonably reasonable English then you will get at least three out of five and that will get you over the cutoff point for and University at this point if you still with us we talked about space but you don't have much all we talked about scoring I'll explain how the scoring system work I'm kind of given a walkthrough of how I would approach a Section 3 paper from picking a question to do in the brain dump to do any organization face or just like what I'm going to write and then checking to make sure everything is fine add a few emails over the last few weeks of people asking what books do you recommend for Section 3 whether you should read a show instructions medical ethics what do you keep up-to-date with DVC Health in God you and stuff get some more points a Section 3 and what I would say too old. Is that obviously when you're applying to medicine it's useful to be in a baby up-to-date with what's going on in the healthcare industry reading Guardian obbc Health anything like that stuff in preparation for Section 3 because to be honest by the time Section 3 comes around and by the time most people stop preparing for the GMAT if anybody got a month or two until until the exam and there is only so much u.s. a writing skills can improve in a month or two I've marked last five years from teaching the classes of people sending them into us and what makes a good essay is not that they've introduced some Rogue points that they got from A Treatise about medical ethics it's just that they stated the basic points a bit more nicely than other people have soy I don't think is that much to be gained from actively reading about medical ethics and things in preparation for Section 3 but of course I mean if you're interested you should be doing anyway and in preparation for interviews it's always good to have more knowledge in your bank how was can you prepare the section 3 should I be practicing one time. They each day will that kind of stuff and I will take us probably a bit Overkill and tons of actual time that says you don't even need to do two or three to get an idea of what your timing is like and then the rest of them if you really feel like you've struggled with Section 3 then I would recommend just going through the past papers and just planning the essay about that's what we do here at Cambridge we have essays to write most of us don't bother writing out the whole essay when revising for exams we just kind of think about it and planned the essay out because we know that if that came up we'd be able to write it and that makes sense so planning is quicker than actually watching is boring and really annoying so do a few essays actually times and writing it down just so you have an idea what the timing be like but don't worry too much about doing Reams and reams of pine. I don't think that's going to be particularly helpful instead if you just tell me you'll get all the benefit from it so yeah I think that everything I have to say about Section 3 want to stay in my opinion it's the easiest part of the bee mount anything like that about about any kind of topic ready you just need to answer the question try and put your point across clearly if you do that you'll get at least three out of five anything above that is just switch on the good sentence structure and that kind of thing about space we talked about scoring I would talk about how to approach the essay one section at a time so the planning of the organization the rising phase I'll give you some thoughts on how I would prepare for sex three I would just write a few times to get the timing right and then I would just maybe practice a few as a tons but even that might be Overkill to come up how in-depth your examples need to be whether you're allowed to make fast up that kind of things would another video on that but in the meantime if you have any questions let me know in the comments below and I'll do my best to answer them thank you very much for watching if you haven't seen the rest of the video how to put a link to a video I did with my friend jadera it like a 20-minute long conversation between the two of us what we talked about how we prepare for the GMAT and just kind of give you some more tips for it so put a link to that down below thank you very much for watching and I'll see you in the next one by

 open my favorite Mac apps in four categories of create consume connect and coordinate while having more fun hippie a new tagline anyway big pot getting all done while having fun is the app that we using on a MacBook it'll time is sunset in this area I'm going to break down all the different apps that I use with timestamps and things to everything in the video descriptions of feel free to skip around the video if you feel like it alright let's stop with the create category and there are 7 apps in this the first one being Google Chrome and now like these days I seem to spend most of my life in Chrome around a few Central web apps that the main one that I used most of my personal note taking and Jen life management type stuff is cool to room research this is a sort of nice subscription-based kind of note taking app but it's not really a note taking app it sort of like a generalized second brain personal Knowledge Management E-Type about Rome I have a dedicated video about it up there and it loads more info on my work list series on nebula which I'll tell you more about in a little bit but essentially things I use room for is first thing in the morning or do morning Pages morning pages is this thing where you just live right out a Morning Joe these days I like to write three things that I'm grateful for I like to write three things that I'm going to do to make today great and I recently started experimenting with this kind of affirmation type stuff off to speaking to Justin Colin on a YouTube livestream where he recommended all of these things as beer nice ways to add a little bit more wellness and mindfulness and happiness to one's life once I've done that I like to write the phrase today is going to be the best day ever which then, promise me to write more and more stuff and usually by the time I get one or two paragraphs and I realized oh I could do this and this that's what I get the URL for my morning darling practice but hey it's all good it's a work-in-progress then once I always set a daily highlight this is the one thing that I want to accomplish today and if I get it done then today would have been a win and that is filming this video and so while earlier today sitting on the sofa on my on my MacBook to Verizon without actually kind of typed out a lot of notes for this very video in Rome itself has room for a lot of other things including anyway to do list and note-taking and the ladies that will cast on method and play my weekly reviews older that are going to be coming in a video at some point but if you want to learn more about them now the rule of the workflow series that I'm gone nebula more details in the description and I'll tell you about it at the End of Time inside the Gmail app on Chrome now back in the day I used to use superhuman my email superhuman recently has been a little bit buggy on the M1 Mac Mini and the M1 MacBook Pro and so I'm ended up just using gmail.com for most of my email management and the thing that I like about using gmail.com rather than having a dedicated app is that the Restriction it takes a few seconds weegy because to me my major productivity is not in replying to emails it means that if I make it less likely that I'll reply to emails yes some people might get annoyed that I'm starting replying to emails but overall I get a lot more done publicity relies on you replying to emails and then it makes sense to have a dedicated app that lets you do it super super fast the day I spend a lot of time in Google Docs this is predominantly where me and my team write blog posts on my website and spending most of my time in writing my book proposal and research a note to my book and I also spent a lot of time in Google Slides making presentation with PowerPoint on the weekend I was running this crash course for how to use from research where will the proceeds would be against malaria foundation and we raised I think $8,000 through this like like course and that was nice besides sewing our presentations and Tina this is one that we would bring the rain gear and finding a niche in like different types of gear in audio and video and all this stuff and lots and lots of time spent in Google Slides extensions there are three that I use on a daily basis firstly is videos controller which lets me speed up YouTube videos and anything else that I'm watching say like 3x or 4X instapaper save extension instapaper because if I want to read an article I save it to instapaper and I can read it when it's a paper across any of my devices and the best thing is I like anything on instapaper it sinks automatically turo thanks to read weismore not in a detail up their clothing magical inside looking framework and funny because I'm a YouTuber and if using tubebuddy quite lost you but he's a fantastic Chrome extension for YouTuber that lets you see search they can do a b testing and do a lot of stuff link to a 60 day free trial if you want to check it out in the video description I spend the bulk of my time I probably spend most of my time on I use the most of my personal stuff any kind of personal note taking that need to do books that I've read no taking that sort of thing for the notion is Westhoff goes if it involves a production process with my team so anything for a part-time YouTuber Academy anything for the YouTube channel anything for a podcast usually goes oceans that I can work on it with my Team Epiphany part-time YouTuber Academy on Mexico boat is going to snow in June 2021 Link in the description if you want to join the waiting list for that but we've got tons and tons of information that that helps our team fictional to spawn stuff will use it to manage all video production schedule for YouTube video so you can have a little sneak peek of what's going on on the channel for the next month or so and we're also using notion to manage a lot of the research for the button writing research bags for every chapter and summaries of books and stuff Amity more reading to try and create this book that I'm ultimately Trimec in the next two years there's a link in the description again to my book email list for my book journey if you want to keep abreast of developments in my vagina and get like snake print app stores and all of that kind of fun stuff so that was Chrome and that was notion which is where I spend most of my time we have a very fun app called Loom that limits a very easy way of recording videos while recording your screen and this is what I use for a lot of screen cost to get to my Rosa weather report on YouTuber called me for the people in the executive plan plan I give them personalized feedback on their YouTube videos and so I just open up Bloom what's the YouTube video and as I'm watching it I can comment along and share my thoughts on the video free unlock codes right now and I wish this were mother saw the video on the end of it that I use for creation is gold Sigma sigma's what I use to help design website and to design like some nail designs and Brendan guidelines and oldest General graphic designing stuff that does something dedicated like Photoshop easy to move things around do cool stuff like that and we go to sign for different types of blood poster for example The Ultimate Guide to studying for exams bit of emojis we have a table of contents going on we've gotten ourselves sidebar of here. I designed in figma and then headed up to a developer loaded it into a theme with his running on ghost website platform looks looks kind of pretty and we're working on building that up on the website as well as using fake much of design all the materials for mine and my brothers weekly podcast which now has a YouTube channel again you can check video description and so on female we are kind of figuring out what's the YouTube cover Banner going to look like one of the thumbnails going to look like and send me and my brother are still going back and forth about this but we think we might run designed to something else looks something like this around emotional rollercoaster types of the video might be free and you can use it with a team and it's usually all in the browser but they do have a Mac app as well which I have on my MacBook Pro on all my money so if you're interested in any kind of web design and graphic design stuff hundred percent recommend figma to double make a list we have an app called day one which is what I use for journaling now I have a private Journal which I'm going to show you because I always accidentally show screenshots of it I also have a journal called nice comments which is where I post screenshots and automatically forward emails that contain like nice comments straight into that job so if I'm feeling sad I can look through my 467 journal entries been nice comments and kind of feel a little bit of an emotional and spiritual boost and I've got this memorabilia Journal sofra Gunplay friend give me a birthday card and I consider myself a bit of a minimalist and I want to throw the best day one and then I will have it forever and I can throw the piece of paper in the bin yes I still use Microsoft Word because my editor at the Publishing House even though I like using looks with my team of everything when it comes to the book we have to go back and forth between marks off of wood files which is kind of funny but it's actually pretty good because if you want you can turn off your internet and do something in Microsoft Word track changes feature has a very easy to use which means you can see what Changes in Attitude did the stop the right thing you can like collaborate on written documents that way and finally I use the app Sublime Text to make changes to my website so I can see myself a little bit of a coder because I used to code quite a lot when I was younger I don't do it that much anymore going to be able to tweak bits of my website and add stuff here and there when I want to and Sublime Text is just the code editor of choice that I've been using for the last decade and so I've got no reason to switch to something like Visual Studio code which I think a lot of people using these days hiconsumption apps and there are three broad things in this list firstly we have the Kindle app can Laptop City fantastic I use Kindle across all my devices from an iPad as well is that I can very easily flick through my I'm reading and I can highlight things and because I highlight things to get synchronize with Rome and notion automatically more in that video over there about the magical inside loading frame instapaper I use instapaper on Mac to read articles and then again when I highlight them they synchronize Stephen the ocean thanks for be wise Anthony on the consumption front I use Spotify for all of my music of choice I would dearly love to switch to Apple music so that I can be 100% in the Apple ecosystem but every time I've tried it's just been so so so bad compared to Spotify you love Spotify by the way check out my Spotify profile Link in the description if you want to see what sort of music I like next on the list we have connect Navi the apps for connecting and communicating and making friends and maintaining relationships zoom zoom as a teen to spend most of my life on a very soon chords these days but what you might not know is that there is another amazing up CO2 grain and grain is really interesting because grain automatically can record your phone calls and it can transcribe them and so if I'm having a zoom call I know that there's always a transcript of it that's available and even while I'm doing the zoom call I can take notes within the gray nap and then it flags up the point where I was taking notes in the transcript and so for example and having loads of interviews and phone calls with people around my book these days and set say something particularly interesting I can just do a little star emoji on grain and then I can find that points if I ever need to go back to it against the grain + resume is absolutely amazing has been spending tons and tons of time because we're running I'm like 400 pounds a month resume for oliveri's pizza that we use Music zooms about animals have been running Zoom co-working sessions with people from all around the world every morning we get together on a zoom call I share my Spotify instrumental playlist Iota Zoom these days next we have the app slack now you slept for most of my team communication Wheels have a select team for a part-time YouTuber in a circle with a membership Community act like a ton of other things for example for a podcast know everything can we have a private members-only slack group lacking slack is where I spent the fourth largest amount of time so ROM notion resume and slakah like my top for in terms of like actual usage then we have two good things you have WhatsApp web which is a very easy way of replying to WhatsApp messages sleeping on it is just so so so painfully slow there for use WhatsApp web which has a native make up for it which is nice and finally we have the apps for coordination now there's actually quite a lot to talk about here this is a topic that I'm extremely passionate about let's talk a few utilities. Continent without this is the stuff that I always install on my Mac anytime I got a new Mac or anytime I do a refresh the first one is Alfred Alfred is amazing Alfred is a spotlight replacement tool which means you can hit come on in space bar and you can type in unopened apps it does web searches for you give you Snippets it's got loads and loads and loads of features that are too numerous to elucidate use for window management another nice thing about moon is that you can create keyboard shortcuts that let you snap Windows Tucson pots of the screen room is mostly what I use when I'm on my huge ass 49 inch ultrawide monitor a way of stopping windows in the middle of the side of the other side usually when I'm on my MacBook Pro screen is a 13-inch MacBook Pro and therefore I only really use one at a time very occasionally if I'm on my Kindle on one half the screen and taking notes in Medela how often do use moom to soy sauce healthy window management but normally helps turn your screen yellow when it's not time I know that iOS nighttime not display something like that but I find Flex to be more yellow on because I have to work late into the night I like my screen to eat very very very yellow so I'm limiting the blue light exposure to my eyes which the party good for you password manager of choice there for a condom without it because I don't remember any house with several stores nicely and Security in Dashlane and the other use to take notes when I'm on the go is actually dropped you like Apple notes in that you got across all your devices Apple watch 4 iPad MacBook but that's right that's right but it just I just wanted to be a little bit faster and so if I need to type anything on the go drop to the first app that'll open on any device or if I'm driving or walking and I want to dictate a note into my Apple watch I have dropped widget on my Apple watch that. but that syncs across all my devices as well entered Ross to me really act as a quick capture inbox which means like you know if I'm taking notes and something else. Up and drops for then usually will end up either in room or an ocean depending on what its being useful so management now and there's two apps that I use the photo management Wesley I just use the book standard Apple photos then I think about this is all of the zillion zillion supposed to say I take my phone off for my camera I can just drag and drop straight into Apple photos in fact I trust that they'll be there whenever I need them and the people Patriots cool because it helps pick out people from your photos so that say this is my brother who I do the podcast with check out our YouTube channel description that's not him that's him tell him that's not him that's not him that's him that's him and I can I can tag of these photos of my brother and the cool thing is that it like lets you see all the photos you've got with these people it creates custom albums of them four people in your People album this is nice because if it's someone other than my brother who is kind of last text Ivy and it's that birthday just come up then I can send them the video that Apple photos automatically generates with a nice like music in the background and then that person will hug oh my God I put the time and effort to create a custom video for me for my birthday isn't he such a thoughtful boy whereas obviously this is just like Julio's Matthew generated stamps Apple photos well I can watch that I can watch it can remind me of memories any time that I spent with my brother just generally good all-around is Lightroom CC under the T-Mobile kind of web Cloud sync Lightroom Lightroom classic because I know I just take tons and tons and tons of photos of myself so there is some else and so I've got these like shared albums that I can share with my team would like hundreds and hundreds of photos of me and varying like various degrees of compromising positions so that I can do them for thumbnails and the cool thing about writing Lightroom it that has nice kind of photo editing features as well so famously when you do some nails on YouTube you want to make them because they get compressed so much and trunk so much that this is the before photo which looks like This Is Us Rotten on my edits which looks a bit like ridiculous you wouldn't edit a photo like that normally sit down it makes sense to make the photo a little bit more so it stands out more and feel a little bit more pick Beatties of people like you guys can actually click on it organization I should just use Google Drive usually on the web I don't do any kind of local thinking because these days I don't work with a little local files the only local files I work with a video files from YouTube videos and stuff and zoom recording I put those into a folder called and then I immediately upload them to my team's Google Drive which has unlimited storage on it so probably views 12.3 terabyte thank you Google for the unlimited storage which I think is going away sometime soon Dimensions run right at the start and I said that I've got this workflow series on nebula now if you haven't had nebulizers an independent streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of other creators and on that beat. We can put all the content that would necessarily work on YouTube so it's not like a YouTube competitor but got like going super super in-depth about 7 apps which is what I did my work for series episode of stuff that's probably a little bit Niche for YouTube and so it's nice having nebula as a store that early access to my videos and add free access to this video so there's no ads sort of adds a taken out for nebula videos and it's not just me it's a bunch of other crazy might have heard it was well-liked was Frank and Wendover Productions and legal eagle and Lindsey Allison notion the best way to sign up to curiositystream Mulberry Conley sponsoring this video stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform and on curiositystream there are thousands of really high-quality hibody documentaries that you can watch if you like state is cool tea blockchain Revolution which is like a very short 20-minute documentary about the history of the blockchain and how it's going to change the world on the coolest thing is that because curiositystream support independent creators a special bundle with nebula and that means that if you sign a picture of a stream for you get free access to nebula so this is less than $15 a year for tons of high budget high-quality documentary plus all of our bonus content on nebula including my workers here is where you can learn about how I use all my fancy productivity apps deal in the streaming World said you want to take advantage of that then head over to curiositystream.com Alley and then you'll get your nebula details email to you and then you can watch all of my tutorials about Roman ocean which is my favorite productivity apps for the iPad but I do use occasionally even the most of my time is spent on the MacBook excellent, see you in the next video
