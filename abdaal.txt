translation is:   play Prince welcome back to the tunnel in this video we're going to go over 10 cheap purchases that have improved my quality of life let's get into it coming in at number 10 on the list we have a physical alarm clock that is really cool because before I had one of these are used to use my phone as an alarm clock and I'd have the phone on my bedside table but inevitably it would mean that I would spend hours and hours scouring through Instagram and attempting to reply to messages on hinge at night when I should have been saving across the room away from my bed or even in the kitchen on charge if I really need to get up one morning and so for a relatively cheap investment of like between 5 and 20 quit depending on have fun to get on for kids you can mess up the improve your quality of sleep if you get one of these now the only thing that you need to have in an electric toothbrush if you have one it needs to have a 30-second timer to the cool thing about this one is that you go and then every 30 second it does like a send it so it tells you when 30 seconds are up and it tells you when 2 minutes are up so you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of the mouth and then you know when you been brushing for 2 minutes I've been using this for the past year now and I noticed a massive Improvement in like the whiteness of my smile and my brother even commented on it when we were recording a podcast he was like a boy we have the trustee ukulele now I started learning the ukulele when I was in my second year of medical school and ready it was the first instrument that I learned I learned by following YouTube tutorials I just really like the idea of playing guitar with ukulele seemed like 15 cut off Amazon Annie ukulele was ready my gateway drug into the world of music is too loud would highly recommend a link to a cheap version on Amazon and video description you can basically get the cheapest one learn how to play that and then if you want you can upgrade to a slightly fancier one but yeah 15 lb of my basic first ukulele it was pretty awesome and it got me into the world of Music on the list we have my absolute favorite writing potable time this is the puck up had like I've tried and I always keep coming back because it's like the quality of the paper and the quality of The Vibes and the feel and the look and the general spiritual Essence that puts out it's just like Second To None I quite like the basic now I'm using the paper dividers pens write to the wooden within Arm's Reach inside of evonie to write anything down this this is something nice about Daniel to scriba lights on a full pack of head rather than have to write it in a nap so highly recommend easy the Fantastic the best path I've ever used in my life I have like physical copy of all three on my desk at all times as part of my desk setup in particular encourage me to write online a video over there if you want to check that out feel like an autistic school about stealing ideas like an autistic to talk about the general idea that nothing is original we don't need to worry about having original ideas we can steal like autistic and get ideas from different sources that says I'm so it's like a really nice like it's very cheap vinyl it takes like 20 minutes to read each of them and I've heard of these are very well 12th thumb through so anytime I'm having a bit of a creative rats or I'm in a bit of a slump I just pick up one of them that goes with the vibe of the rest of my desk is has been amazing because now I drink so much more water and drinking water as they say is good for you and I've noticed that on days when I drink more water I feel less I feel less bloated and my skin feels like it's glowing not sure how much of that is Placebo but yeah we would go to medical school doing close-up magic in 2011 after watching the top with Michael Vincent on Penn and Teller fool us as a way of trying to increase my sexual market value amongst my peers of school but then when I go to university and reinvented myself as not a massive nerd I decided to continue with my purse at Magic and I used to perform at balls and parties and events around the University I got to go to be looking like hey you want to see a magic trick that was that was my jam back in the day and even though like I always have it all to me because if I ever need something to do with my hands then I'll just do some partial for the debit card because otherwise The Devil Makes work for Idle Hands getting a Kindle lets you to give you the ability to read infinitely more books than you would otherwise these days anytime I get a book recommendation I just buy on Kindle immediately and I can start reading it there and then it's just absolutely amazing I've been using Kindle basic
