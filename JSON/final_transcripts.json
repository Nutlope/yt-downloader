            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the Baymont tip series my name is Ali and in this video we're going to be talking about section three everyone gets worried about section three because it's it's billed as rising costs is a say that you have to write but I was probably too easy explaining the tips and tactics on how to do well in Section 3 and how to prepare for it about space and scoring the two s's and then we're going to go on to talk about some Section 3 and on the day of the exam score in Section 3 space you really don't have much space to write on this is what the answer she looks like as you'll see it's pretty much in a full page but the top quarter of it is taken up with your name and headlight number to Radio you have to write on all three causes of us for the full size of April cuz that border around the edges but you know a lot to right outside of so what we always recommend is that instead of thinking of Section 3 as as like an essay instead think of it as just writing three paragraphs because really you only have room the Wright 3 apple pie graph in that school books that they give you and I think thinking about it as running a few paragraphs makes it much more psychologically manageable than thinking about it as an essay because I say so scary I see you got a number out of five like 1 2 3 4 5 or like a point five in the middle of that and you get a grade so ABCD or E the number is basically the content of your essay when you have a letter the letters the grammatical spelling punctuation stuff most people get a for grandmothers some people get be a very small minority Cassie and if you want a d or heat you really have to try hard to activity screw things up cuz it really is quite hard to get a d or an e-4 Grandma USA is marked by to examine Domino's 10 to be graduate students at Cambridge each year we get the email from the emissions testing service saying would you like to Mark Bina essays and you get paid like an hour and they give yous averaged out but it doesn't even if discrepancy in Mark's between two examiners like one gives you a 5A and one gives you a 2d then the senior exam to mock sat and that kind of add some element of a safety to this otherwise fairly subjective help with marking to be my essay 3 is pretty pretty reasonable 4 and 5 of Pretty Good most people get an A or B for the grandma thing so I mean from what I understand what universities use a cup of maybe about 2.5 see so as long as you get the three CR above then you're pretty fine and actually together three all you really have to do is answer the question I have provided you answer the question chances are you will get at least a 3 and then if you use like nice language and explain 0.93 that's what gets you into the 4th and 5 what we talked about space you don't have much of it and we talked about scoring let's not talk about tactics on how to prepare Section 3 section 3 you get half an hour and you have to write one of four possible essay titles one of those titles of using a question like you might be should we iOffer treatments to appease people under the NHS or it might be something about you that so I think I cat euthanasia or like that kind of thing play some kind of Cardiff s topic so am I your I think it was about freedom and Liberties and I think one year that was asking about education policies and stuff like that and the fourth one is usually some kind of quote by nature or Aristotle Socrates or someone famous and you have to interpret the quote and kind of answer the sub-questions associated with a question or statement and then you have three or four sometimes 2L sub questions provided you answer all of the sub questions you will almost certainly get at least at 3 if you fail to address any of the sub-questions the highest Mach they can give you the two so the one sure way of completely destroying your section 3 paper is by not answering one of the questions so please don't do that please make sure that you answer everything aspect of the question that you've chosen okay so how did you the question this is also an interesting topic we always recommend that you spent at least 2 or 3 minutes activity deciding which question to do it's very easy In the Heat of the exam you know it's you just on section 2 the super-secret I'm pressured you ready set up a section 2 and you think oh crap I didn't have any time in section 2 therefore need to rush into Section 3 please don't do this Section 3 is not very time pressure that's all you got half an hour and in fact the only take about 10-15 minutes to write in that box more choose your question wisely what I would recommend is that after we go through each of the essay titles and just kind of thinking your head right what point do I have to dressy to be so some points and then they take the one that you have the most things to say for in terms of choosing a question there is no benefit to choosing a weird question over a normal question so I mean some people that I've spoken to over the past few years seem to think that I do if I choose the weird quote by Aristotle then the examiners will look at me more favorably because ever answering the question about medical ethics but no one's going to answer that question completely ignore that type of thinking just take the question that you think you can dance the best examiner's don't care which one you answer and it's much better for you if you want to the easier question and get the marks on it then if you try Macklemore difficult question just because it seems more difficult so at this point we're about 2 minutes into a Section 3 paper we put 28 minutes ago and we decided what question were going to do the next step of Section 3 is to replant RSA very well. 18 minutes planning my essay planning is by far the most important part of Section 3 what you want to do if you want to the point where you know exactly what you're going to write when you finally put pen to paper and it's an onion like making stuff up as you go along places that you only really have one shot about section three on two sheets of the rules have changed in recent times but previously they were only ever allowed to give you one sheet and if you screwed up. Shaped and that was the end of it so what we always say his treat this onto sheet as if it's sacred touch it at all until you've already planned USA and you know exactly what you going to do in terms of the planning stage we recommend splitting up into two parts number one is the brain dump face and then the two of the organization phase to the brain don't phase where you'd like I mean let's say the S8 obese people should be treated under the NHS because it's a southern Fix condition something like that the subsections might be explain a reason for everything a reason against on to give your own thoughts so we can split up a paper nicely into three sections we go for we go again so in the brain that face I would just be writing as many points as I can possibly think of for the for for the against and kind of workout what conclusion I want to go from here say the budget of the entrance is around 210 billion but this isn't enough because Cancer drugs and having fun today and he's being closed down that would have been to the point of you making it that we have limited resources but then I'll be kind of expanding on it with maybe one or two extra bits of information and that would turn it from like maybe a three essay intro for essay for example so this up as many points as we can and then an organization face which took should take a few minutes we pretty much pick one or two points from each section that we're going to because if you don't have the space to write any more than that and an essay like we should treat a v people under the NHS is a long-ass day and I'm sure you'd love to write losing those about it but you only have these three or four paragraphs so you got to pick your best points and think about how they're going to flow together SSA for example I might be like a my introduction is going to be this afternoon production I'm going to say one reason in favor of not treating of these people is that the visit is often regarded as a self-inflicted condition given the limited resources of the NHL seems unfair to use funds for the treatment of a self-inflicted condition when those funds could instead be used to fund cancer treatment 02 fun to genetic pediatric cases things like that and then argue against this I might say that have treatment under the NHS as anyone else because they pay taxes and because the NHS was founded on the principle of free healthcare at the point of need if I have space I might do one more of each and then I'll conclude by saying in conclusion I believe that. And I would have this kind of in my head and paper during my organization phase of the planning so this point we still haven't put pen-to-paper we still haven't written anything on a 1/2 sheet we're just kind of actively very very detailed planning RSA because we've got loads of time so that's the planning phase of Section 3 the writing face if you go to put pen to paper and write in really small really neat handwriting on this onto page this morning you right pretty much the better it is because you can put more points in and I can give you a more marks if you're up very untidily that's bad because read it and you just want to really make an effort to try writing as neatly as possible if you're the type of person whose handwriting is atrocious then give yourself a bit more time for the writing spend a bit a little bit less time of the timing because it needs you can make your handwriting the better it'll be for you one thing I always recommend preparing for Section 3 is that you should practice 123 timed essays in advance Lipozene before the exam and you should print off that answer grid that's on the beam at on the official FEMA website I'll put it in tableau that'll be able to see exactly how much space you but the writing so when you do the song that says you write it on that piece of paper and you time how long it takes you personally to write very small really need and to fill that Gap fill that space so when I was doing it and it took me about 12:30 what's the right way to small wedding in that space so that means I could have 50 minutes planning to music using a question and maybe sometime left over again for checking if I was a big Quake on the writing front so yeah what you guys should do when preparing the section 3 do a couple of time to essays time how long it takes and that box and use that time to work out how much time you got available to planning for checking in for choosing a question Vicki useful to check through the essay make sure you got everything sorted make sure you haven't accidentally put a knot in your confusion which would completely change the meaning of USA however we do want to be avoiding doing the whole Crossing and asterixis and that that kind of thing you was a contrite please turn over and write on the back because it's only the front of the sheets against guns and it's just not very nice brick Domino's to have to kind of interpret schooling than astrix and stuff so he can avoid it than that would be ideal but of course if you're in danger of question like if you go to the end of the essay and you'd like oh crap I haven't read my conclusion and that was one of the things I was being off then yes of course you need to do whatever it takes to get that confusion in that because if you don't have a conclusion on the question asked you to write a conclusion then you're going to get to I-25 we wouldn't want that in your checking phase just make sure everything is everything is in order and above will make sure you answer the question because that's the most important thing and actually if you only take away one thing from this video is that please answer the question if it has three subsections that you have good rest please address free subsection if you do that and write reasonably reasonable English then you will get at least three out of five and that will get you over the cutoff point for and University at this point if you still with us we talked about space but you don't have much all we talked about scoring I'll explain how the scoring system work I'm kind of given a walkthrough of how I would approach a Section 3 paper from picking a question to do in the brain dump to do any organization face or just like what I'm going to write and then checking to make sure everything is fine add a few emails over the last few weeks of people asking what books do you recommend for Section 3 whether you should read a show instructions medical ethics what do you keep up-to-date with DVC Health in God you and stuff get some more points a Section 3 and what I would say too old. Is that obviously when you're applying to medicine it's useful to be in a baby up-to-date with what's going on in the healthcare industry reading Guardian obbc Health anything like that stuff in preparation for Section 3 because to be honest by the time Section 3 comes around and by the time most people stop preparing for the GMAT if anybody got a month or two until until the exam and there is only so much u.s. a writing skills can improve in a month or two I've marked last five years from teaching the classes of people sending them into us and what makes a good essay is not that they've introduced some Rogue points that they got from A Treatise about medical ethics it's just that they stated the basic points a bit more nicely than other people have soy I don't think is that much to be gained from actively reading about medical ethics and things in preparation for Section 3 but of course I mean if you're interested you should be doing anyway and in preparation for interviews it's always good to have more knowledge in your bank how was can you prepare the section 3 should I be practicing one time. They each day will that kind of stuff and I will take us probably a bit Overkill and tons of actual time that says you don't even need to do two or three to get an idea of what your timing is like and then the rest of them if you really feel like you've struggled with Section 3 then I would recommend just going through the past papers and just planning the essay about that's what we do here at Cambridge we have essays to write most of us don't bother writing out the whole essay when revising for exams we just kind of think about it and planned the essay out because we know that if that came up we'd be able to write it and that makes sense so planning is quicker than actually watching is boring and really annoying so do a few essays actually times and writing it down just so you have an idea what the timing be like but don't worry too much about doing Reams and reams of pine. I don't think that's going to be particularly helpful instead if you just tell me you'll get all the benefit from it so yeah I think that everything I have to say about Section 3 want to stay in my opinion it's the easiest part of the bee mount anything like that about about any kind of topic ready you just need to answer the question try and put your point across clearly if you do that you'll get at least three out of five anything above that is just switch on the good sentence structure and that kind of thing about space we talked about scoring I would talk about how to approach the essay one section at a time so the planning of the organization the rising phase I'll give you some thoughts on how I would prepare for sex three I would just write a few times to get the timing right and then I would just maybe practice a few as a tons but even that might be Overkill to come up how in-depth your examples need to be whether you're allowed to make fast up that kind of things would another video on that but in the meantime if you have any questions let me know in the comments below and I'll do my best to answer them thank you very much for watching if you haven't seen the rest of the video how to put a link to a video I did with my friend jadera it like a 20-minute long conversation between the two of us what we talked about how we prepare for the GMAT and just kind of give you some more tips for it so put a link to that down below thank you very much for watching and I'll see you in the next one by"

is the app that we using on a MacBook it'll time is sunset in this area I'm going to break down all the different apps that I use with timestamps and things to everything in the video descriptions of feel free to skip around the video if you feel like it alright let's stop with the create category and there are 7 apps in this the first one being Google Chrome and now like these days I seem to spend most of my life in Chrome around a few Central web apps that the main one that I used most of my personal note taking and Jen life management type stuff is cool to room research this is a sort of nice subscription-based kind of note taking app but it's not really a note taking app it sort of like a generalized second brain personal Knowledge Management E-Type about Rome I have a dedicated video about it up there and it loads more info on my work list series on nebula which I'll tell you more about in a little bit but essentially things I use room for is first thing in the morning or do morning Pages morning pages is this thing where you just live right out a Morning Joe these days I like to write three things that I'm grateful for I like to write three things that I'm going to do to make today great and I recently started experimenting with this kind of affirmation type stuff off to speaking to Justin Colin on a YouTube livestream where he recommended all of these things as beer nice ways to add a little bit more wellness and mindfulness and happiness to one's life once I've done that I like to write the phrase today is going to be the best day ever which then, promise me to write more and more stuff and usually by the time I get one or two paragraphs and I realized oh I could do this and this that's what I get the URL for my morning darling practice but hey it's all good it's a work-in-progress then once I always set a daily highlight this is the one thing that I want to accomplish today and if I get it done then today would have been a win and that is filming this video and so while earlier today sitting on the sofa on my on my MacBook to Verizon without actually kind of typed out a lot of notes for this very video in Rome itself has room for a lot of other things including anyway to do list and note-taking and the ladies that will cast on method and play my weekly reviews older that are going to be coming in a video at some point but if you want to learn more about them now the rule of the workflow series that I'm gone nebula more details in the description and I'll tell you about it at the End of Time inside the Gmail app on Chrome now back in the day I used to use superhuman my email superhuman recently has been a little bit buggy on the M1 Mac Mini and the M1 MacBook Pro and so I'm ended up just using gmail.com for most of my email management and the thing that I like about using gmail.com rather than having a dedicated app is that the Restriction it takes a few seconds weegy because to me my major productivity is not in replying to emails it means that if I make it less likely that I'll reply to emails yes some people might get annoyed that I'm starting replying to emails but overall I get a lot more done publicity relies on you replying to emails and then it makes sense to have a dedicated app that lets you do it super super fast the day I spend a lot of time in Google Docs this is predominantly where me and my team write blog posts on my website and spending most of my time in writing my book proposal and research a note to my book and I also spent a lot of time in Google Slides making presentation with PowerPoint on the weekend I was running this crash course for how to use from research where will the proceeds would be against malaria foundation and we raised I think $8,000 through this like like course and that was nice besides sewing our presentations and Tina this is one that we would bring the rain gear and finding a niche in like different types of gear in audio and video and all this stuff and lots and lots of time spent in Google Slides extensions there are three that I use on a daily basis firstly is videos controller which lets me speed up YouTube videos and anything else that I'm watching say like 3x or 4X instapaper save extension instapaper because if I want to read an article I save it to instapaper and I can read it when it's a paper across any of my devices and the best thing is I like anything on instapaper it sinks automatically turo thanks to read weismore not in a detail up their clothing magical inside looking framework and funny because I'm a YouTuber and if using tubebuddy quite lost you but he's a fantastic Chrome extension for YouTuber that lets you see search they can do a b testing and do a lot of stuff link to a 60 day free trial if you want to check it out in the video description I spend the bulk of my time I probably spend most of my time on I use the most of my personal stuff any kind of personal note taking that need to do books that I've read no taking that sort of thing for the notion is Westhoff goes if it involves a production process with my team so anything for a part-time YouTuber Academy anything for the YouTube channel anything for a podcast usually goes oceans that I can work on it with my Team Epiphany part-time YouTuber Academy on Mexico boat is going to snow in June 2021 Link in the description if you want to join the waiting list for that but we've got tons and tons of information that that helps our team fictional to spawn stuff will use it to manage all video production schedule for YouTube video so you can have a little sneak peek of what's going on on the channel for the next month or so and we're also using notion to manage a lot of the research for the button writing research bags for every chapter and summaries of books and stuff Amity more reading to try and create this book that I'm ultimately Trimec in the next two years there's a link in the description again to my book email list for my book journey if you want to keep abreast of developments in my vagina and get like snake print app stores and all of that kind of fun stuff so that was Chrome and that was notion which is where I spend most of my time we have a very fun app called Loom that limits a very easy way of recording videos while recording your screen and this is what I use for a lot of screen cost to get to my Rosa weather report on YouTuber called me for the people in the executive plan plan I give them personalized feedback on their YouTube videos and so I just open up Bloom what's the YouTube video and as I'm watching it I can comment along and share my thoughts on the video free unlock codes right now and I wish this were mother saw the video on the end of it that I use for creation is gold Sigma sigma's what I use to help design website and to design like some nail designs and Brendan guidelines and oldest General graphic designing stuff that does something dedicated like Photoshop easy to move things around do cool stuff like that and we go to sign for different types of blood poster for example The Ultimate Guide to studying for exams bit of emojis we have a table of contents going on we've gotten ourselves sidebar of here. I designed in figma and then headed up to a developer loaded it into a theme with his running on ghost website platform looks looks kind of pretty and we're working on building that up on the website as well as using fake much of design all the materials for mine and my brothers weekly podcast which now has a YouTube channel again you can check video description and so on female we are kind of figuring out what's the YouTube cover Banner going to look like one of the thumbnails going to look like and send me and my brother are still going back and forth about this but we think we might run designed to something else looks something like this around emotional rollercoaster types of the video might be free and you can use it with a team and it's usually all in the browser but they do have a Mac app as well which I have on my MacBook Pro on all my money so if you're interested in any kind of web design and graphic design stuff hundred percent recommend figma to double make a list we have an app called day one which is what I use for journaling now I have a private Journal which I'm going to show you because I always accidentally show screenshots of it I also have a journal called nice comments which is where I post screenshots and automatically forward emails that contain like nice comments straight into that job so if I'm feeling sad I can look through my 467 journal entries been nice comments and kind of feel a little bit of an emotional and spiritual boost and I've got this memorabilia Journal sofra Gunplay friend give me a birthday card and I consider myself a bit of a minimalist and I want to throw the best day one and then I will have it forever and I can throw the piece of paper in the bin yes I still use Microsoft Word because my editor at the Publishing House even though I like using looks with my team of everything when it comes to the book we have to go back and forth between marks off of wood files which is kind of funny but it's actually pretty good because if you want you can turn off your internet and do something in Microsoft Word track changes feature has a very easy to use which means you can see what Changes in Attitude did the stop the right thing you can like collaborate on written documents that way and finally I use the app Sublime Text to make changes to my website so I can see myself a little bit of a coder because I used to code quite a lot when I was younger I don't do it that much anymore going to be able to tweak bits of my website and add stuff here and there when I want to and Sublime Text is just the code editor of choice that I've been using for the last decade and so I've got no reason to switch to something like Visual Studio code which I think a lot of people using these days hiconsumption apps and there are three broad things in this list firstly we have the Kindle app can Laptop City fantastic I use Kindle across all my devices from an iPad as well is that I can very easily flick through my I'm reading and I can highlight things and because I highlight things to get synchronize with Rome and notion automatically more in that video over there about the magical inside loading frame instapaper I use instapaper on Mac to read articles and then again when I highlight them they synchronize Stephen the ocean thanks for be wise Anthony on the consumption front I use Spotify for all of my music of choice I would dearly love to switch to Apple music so that I can be 100% in the Apple ecosystem but every time I've tried it's just been so so so bad compared to Spotify you love Spotify by the way check out my Spotify profile Link in the description if you want to see what sort of music I like next on the list we have connect Navi the apps for connecting and communicating and making friends and maintaining relationships zoom zoom as a teen to spend most of my life on a very soon chords these days but what you might not know is that there is another amazing up CO2 grain and grain is really interesting because grain automatically can record your phone calls and it can transcribe them and so if I'm having a zoom call I know that there's always a transcript of it that's available and even while I'm doing the zoom call I can take notes within the gray nap and then it flags up the point where I was taking notes in the transcript and so for example and having loads of interviews and phone calls with people around my book these days and set say something particularly interesting I can just do a little star emoji on grain and then I can find that points if I ever need to go back to it against the grain + resume is absolutely amazing has been spending tons and tons of time because we're running I'm like 400 pounds a month resume for oliveri's pizza that we use Music zooms about animals have been running Zoom co-working sessions with people from all around the world every morning we get together on a zoom call I share my Spotify instrumental playlist Iota Zoom these days next we have the app slack now you slept for most of my team communication Wheels have a select team for a part-time YouTuber in a circle with a membership Community act like a ton of other things for example for a podcast know everything can we have a private members-only slack group lacking slack is where I spent the fourth largest amount of time so ROM notion resume and slakah like my top for in terms of like actual usage then we have two good things you have WhatsApp web which is a very easy way of replying to WhatsApp messages sleeping on it is just so so so painfully slow there for use WhatsApp web which has a native make up for it which is nice and finally we have the apps for coordination now there's actually quite a lot to talk about here this is a topic that I'm extremely passionate about let's talk a few utilities. Continent without this is the stuff that I always install on my Mac anytime I got a new Mac or anytime I do a refresh the first one is Alfred Alfred is amazing Alfred is a spotlight replacement tool which means you can hit come on in space bar and you can type in unopened apps it does web searches for you give you Snippets it's got loads and loads and loads of features that are too numerous to elucidate use for window management another nice thing about moon is that you can create keyboard shortcuts that let you snap Windows Tucson pots of the screen room is mostly what I use when I'm on my huge ass 49 inch ultrawide monitor a way of stopping windows in the middle of the side of the other side usually when I'm on my MacBook Pro screen is a 13-inch MacBook Pro and therefore I only really use one at a time very occasionally if I'm on my Kindle on one half the screen and taking notes in Medela how often do use moom to soy sauce healthy window management but normally helps turn your screen yellow when it's not time I know that iOS nighttime not display something like that but I find Flex to be more yellow on because I have to work late into the night I like my screen to eat very very very yellow so I'm limiting the blue light exposure to my eyes which the party good for you password manager of choice there for a condom without it because I don't remember any house with several stores nicely and Security in Dashlane and the other use to take notes when I'm on the go is actually dropped you like Apple notes in that you got across all your devices Apple watch 4 iPad MacBook but that's right that's right but it just I just wanted to be a little bit faster and so if I need to type anything on the go drop to the first app that'll open on any device or if I'm driving or walking and I want to dictate a note into my Apple watch I have dropped widget on my Apple watch that. but that syncs across all my devices as well entered Ross to me really act as a quick capture inbox which means like you know if I'm taking notes and something else. Up and drops for then usually will end up either in room or an ocean depending on what its being useful so management now and there's two apps that I use the photo management Wesley I just use the book standard Apple photos then I think about this is all of the zillion zillion supposed to say I take my phone off for my camera I can just drag and drop straight into Apple photos in fact I trust that they'll be there whenever I need them and the people Patriots cool because it helps pick out people from your photos so that say this is my brother who I do the podcast with check out our YouTube channel description that's not him that's him tell him that's not him that's not him that's him that's him and I can I can tag of these photos of my brother and the cool thing is that it like lets you see all the photos you've got with these people it creates custom albums of them four people in your People album this is nice because if it's someone other than my brother who is kind of last text Ivy and it's that birthday just come up then I can send them the video that Apple photos automatically generates with a nice like music in the background and then that person will hug oh my God I put the time and effort to create a custom video for me for my birthday isn't he such a thoughtful boy whereas obviously this is just like Julio's Matthew generated stamps Apple photos well I can watch that I can watch it can remind me of memories any time that I spent with my brother just generally good all-around is Lightroom CC under the T-Mobile kind of web Cloud sync Lightroom Lightroom classic because I know I just take tons and tons and tons of photos of myself so there is some else and so I've got these like shared albums that I can share with my team would like hundreds and hundreds of photos of me and varying like various degrees of compromising positions so that I can do them for thumbnails and the cool thing about writing Lightroom it that has nice kind of photo editing features as well so famously when you do some nails on YouTube you want to make them because they get compressed so much and trunk so much that this is the before photo which looks like This Is Us Rotten on my edits which looks a bit like ridiculous you wouldn't edit a photo like that normally sit down it makes sense to make the photo a little bit more so it stands out more and feel a little bit more pick Beatties of people like you guys can actually click on it organization I should just use Google Drive usually on the web I don't do any kind of local thinking because these days I don't work with a little local files the only local files I work with a video files from YouTube videos and stuff and zoom recording I put those into a folder called and then I immediately upload them to my team's Google Drive which has unlimited storage on it so probably views 12.3 terabyte thank you Google for the unlimited storage which I think is going away sometime soon Dimensions run right at the start and I said that I've got this workflow series on nebula now if you haven't had nebulizers an independent streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of other creators and on that beat. We can put all the content that would necessarily work on YouTube so it's not like a YouTube competitor but got like going super super in-depth about 7 apps which is what I did my work for series episode of stuff that's probably a little bit Niche for YouTube and so it's nice having nebula as a store that early access to my videos and add free access to this video so there's no ads sort of adds a taken out for nebula videos and it's not just me it's a bunch of other crazy might have heard it was well-liked was Frank and Wendover Productions and legal eagle and Lindsey Allison notion the best way to sign up to curiositystream Mulberry Conley sponsoring this video stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform and on curiositystream there are thousands of really high-quality hibody documentaries that you can watch if you like state is cool tea blockchain Revolution which is like a very short 20-minute documentary about the history of the blockchain and how it's going to change the world on the coolest thing is that because curiositystream support independent creators a special bundle with nebula and that means that if you sign a picture of a stream for you get free access to nebula so this is less than $15 a year for tons of high budget high-quality documentary plus all of our bonus content on nebula including my workers here is where you can learn about how I use all my fancy productivity apps deal in the streaming World said you want to take advantage of that then head over to curiositystream.com Alley and then you'll get your nebula details email to you and then you can watch all of my tutorials about Roman ocean which is my favorite productivity apps for the iPad but I do use occasionally even the most of my time is spent on the MacBook excellent, see you in the next video"

            "text": " play friends welcome back to the channel if you knew him on a ventilator I'm a doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to show you how I use the app notion to be more effective about the stuff that I read watch and listen to not before discovering this method I used to spend absolutely ages listening to podcasts reading books videos about like business entrepreneurship productivity self-improvement all that stuff and it was that classic trap of consuming too much stuff but not ready acting or reflecting on any of it but so this is what my residence calendar looks like at the moment and the ideas that anytime I read watch or listen to anything that resonates with me that's kind of my boss with me I will drop it into the residence calendar and I'll take some notes on it so for exam we look at this episode of the Farnam Street podcast go to the great game this was Juno 3 2019 at 11 p.m. to the existing took one day and I've got these various notes are at * * 23 or 5 I wrote happiness isn't found by thinking it is found by being gay should have got me riding down the stuff that the the guest of the podcast was saying goodbye. Particular thing resonates with me equally at times I'm 27 how can I have fun and Delight to the person in front of me and that was the stuff they were talking about at the time I thought why don't I make if you know tonight and shove it into my residence calendar and as you can see here at acted with podcast because of the podcast episode and life because I think this is pretty legit life advice I'll talk more about the X in just a moment example about the parameter the various ways in which I'm going to be applying this to my own life so previously what would have otherwise just read an article and think that's kind of cool and never do anything about it now at least I'm writing down my thoughts and ideas and writing down what I plan to do with the information this residence, directly looks like I'll expand more on that intersect but first let's talk about how we actually get stuff into the residence calendar first day with new stenerson Web Clipper I don't a thing for Chrome so that's a fight with me you think about these cases 6 months before I can make a video about them anyway Optical on Keystone habits I wrote in February against all of the email newsletter and I was talking about something that James Clear Atomic habits but I can put that straight into notion using the notion whatsoever so but made my few notes and then I hand her and that goes immediately into my ResMed calendar until I open that notion we see immediately Keystone habits and here are my notes about it. For my sweet Lisa yeah here's another by the article to do with it it's copied and pasted the entire article into the ocean and it's written my nose above it so that when I'm returning to it I can see exactly what I wrote so that's what I use if I'm reading stuff on Chrome and I want to get into notion more often than I tend to be reading all consuming stuff on my iPhone or my and so the tablet which is my podcast out of choice I'm listening to the alternative TV podcast which is run by one of my friends or I talked about all this other stuff I got to put a link in the description to if you want to check it out I can hit this button and then the share. And I could message it to people are messy stuff to do added to my residence calendar and if I want to change this to all the various databases that I go with an ocean but because residents calendar is the one that I always start things to do that's the first one that comes up on podcast and I can write a few notes about this and then when I want I can hit save all my devices I listen to you on the ACV Court count let's fix a typo at the enter to fix the formatting and interview and here are the show notes would automatically get populated here cuz now when I return to this I can immediately see all the references in all the links from this podcast I normally want to take notes and podcast I like to refer to the time stamps so that lets say in six months time I'm making YouTube video and referencing the spot cuz I know exactly where the timestamp ace and I can get it from Lacoste and shove it into my YouTube video stop by the side of the road and write down notes on my phone if already wants to and I do sometimes do that but recently have discovered this app draft for the Apple watch and then while I'm on draft I can record anything but I want to say about this podcast and as you can see it is automatically transcribing that into text in quite a reasonable fashion if I'm honest unlock the safe to my draft inbox and then I can open up draft on my Mac and usually things recently we've got the drop off the sync to Mac and so if I want to add something to the right to the residents calendar I just hit the new button and then I have to do I do have the money for this information so I would write a little doll interview with or something like that I find the url and then I would just copy and paste the notes from dropped into notion and then I would all carpet dropped using keyboard shortcuts there is a bit of manual labor and I would like it at some point on show emotion is going to open up the API and you automatically be able to add stuff from dropped into notion but for now I think just copying and pasting it from one window into another is very reasonable way of doing it and it also means that I can then quick capture I have while I'm driving without having to stop the car on the side of the road get my phone out and then get late for what because I text up there and then I can also questions like if a friend is asking me a l a whooping cough with your command I can be like funny you should ask why don't I use this filter out of filter Etsy tags contains podcast and now goodbye. It's showing me all the podcast that resonates with me of the Lost since the first one since March 23rd 2019 I can just type in the word productivity on the search thing and it was mostly find all of my tags that I've been tagged with productivity but also all of my residents calendar items that have the word productivity in them somewhere and that just makes it a lot easier for me to create content because now all of my stuff about protiviti everything that I've ever read or listen to I can watch that resonates with me about productivity now in this residence calendar and there's another pretty high-tech feature of notion that I do use quite often and that ability to add relay database items to the residents calendar so I show you what I mean by that this whole thing is a database and because notion is based on the notion of databases Westview what I'm just looking at the Council of the notes and the tags I could also view in calendar mode if I really wanted to that's how I started doing this initially so I'll here we go June 2019 was when I put a load of stuff into this and I can see that across across the calendar I can see the stuff that I consumed which I guess would be quite nice way to everything that I'm about to get my table and the table does is that it lets me add links to idea from the calendar so I go to the 2nd database pulled ideas and these are ideas for either blocked Postal in a newsletter articles or video scripts that I might make it some point for the other line and some of these ideas are ideas that I picked up through Reading and watching to stuff and so I'd like to link to the original Source example let's take this one this was on the Arianna Simpson episode of the podcast by the hustle and his property face. Cold resident link and that means I can link items in my residence calendar to these idea items for Simpson not should come up as a resident link to this particular idea and that's useful if I come up with this idea I can see why the source of it was but it's like a back on the resident calendar and look in the table mode now at this point if I go on a specific item I can see all of the latest notes the related idea that I would have been next to that other than one place. This means that if I'm riding my bike to email newsletter and deciding you know I usually pick three or four things that I enjoyed that week that I want to share with the audience this is going to be quite high up on the list because 345 the five different ideas that are generated from this one podcast and that these ideas can then later be turned into blood Frozen articles and stuff so again if we go back to my ideas database go into Refinery most this is the kanban view that notion has so we've published so actually this Windows Vs One X. and then I can drag it over into idea when it's something that might be thinking about Draft when I'm actually writing something about it and email when I've thought about turning into any money and then published when it becomes a blog post website so I like to think of it at the refinery Refinery cuz I think I'm cool as a Refinery for ideas I got the idea of evil self generated or from other sources that I can see him and then it goes through different layers of the refinery ultimately turning into the post and I suppose I'll have one of the KR cold video so if I turn a particular thing into a video then that's one step further along the the pipeline otherwise an hour or two to think of something of the top of my head turn it into it like a reasonably coherent few paragraphs and but now instead of starting with a blank slate I can just think I need to write an email today that was the whole process took me about 20 minutes words before it would have taken like an hour or two because I'm not starting from scratch and stuffed everything that has resonated with me over the past few months how are use notion as a resident Skylander I use notion for a ton of other things as well and I'm going to be sort of making videos overtime about that too but I think the great thing about the about the stuff that I'm consuming think about a how can apply to my life and how I can change my behavior based on that but be also because it lets me think about how to take those ideas from other sources and apply my own land to know my own perspective to them bring them out into the into the world of my own creations and then stop and get back to the original because your work and they speak in glowing terms about it you should check it out and then these people who I admire and want to connect with himself see my tweet and light off. check out this presents calendar I'll put a link to it down the video description and the great thing about notion is that you can make any of your page is public if you want to and you can make your templates public so this is now a public description and then you can duplicate it into you account which means you can just get the template for free to do whatever you like by then you can modify to suit your own goals or whatever you want to do that and you can just add stuff to my overtime unless I can find a ton of other template this is really cool person the fuse by been one of the notion marketing team and that's something that I'm going to be experimenting a lot with as well and I just browsing through the templates and seeing all the various use cases for notion but yeah that was my link in the description you can check out a playlist over there somewhere of my other notion related videos and put videos that you might like as well have a great day and I'll see you in the next"

            "text": " aprons welcome back to the channel let's talk about imposter syndrome now this is something that I have been struggling with for many many years what does YouTube channel on my block on my career as a doctor basically with everything that I've done I've always had a sense of how you how am I supposed to be doing this why supposed to be doing this why are people taking me seriously like all these thoughts Associated around this idea of that maybe I just kind of got lucky and I flipped into the position of being where I am and oh my God now there's attentional May unlike what the hell do I do with it what time I've gotten better at dealing with this imposter syndrome I still got it all the time but in three stories in my life where I really experienced imposter syndrome and lessons learned from it which I'm now taking fourth and I'm trying to apply to my life today the first one is very recent in November of last year when I was running my online course the part-time YouTuber Academy and initially this was supposed to be for like 5 or 10 people where I was going to teach people kind of my systems and processes for me of being a part-time YouTuber but in the first week we ended up 350 people who will paying like these in sums of money to hear me speak and teach them about how to be a YouTuber I had so much imposter syndrome going into this because like the feeling in my mind was how I might have wanted to talk about this I've only got one point something billion subscribers people should be listening to David dobrik on mrbeast subscribers like why am I the one that people are coming to this sort of information and I think a little bit came because I thought that I had nothing really to teach because all of the stop that I built around my YouTube channel with my team I just kind of got that with the internet I do other channels like video crate doesn't think media and like listening to the podcast and I felt like it was nothing new or interesting and it was all kind of just obvious stuff it was all stuff that if you spent a long time during YouTube I felt naturally pick up overtime but as I was giving the lessons over that can live lives in Corsica or if you understand that I'm like the chat was absolutely exploding we like people saying oh my God this actually groundbreaking information and I always get when I can we will have this when we teach something when we explain something if we teaching something it's kind of obvious to us and we don't appreciate that what's obvious to us can be amazing to others and I read this in a Derek sivers blog post I often returned to its it's the study of the curse of knowledge like once we know something we think it's no longer interesting and we think Shirley is obvious to everyone must know that thing answer to me you know we have all these systems around around the YouTube channel like that thing in parallel processing and soda I wasn't born being able to do that kind of stuff internalized over three-and-a-half years of making YouTube videos and reading a ton of productivity books and business books and notebooks and applying will be systems and stuff to my YouTube channel which I kind of tree everyone knows them surely there's nothing new here but actually when I was explaining them this was blowing people's minds and so it was a real illustration that was obvious to you can be amazing to others and this is one of the main issues people have putting yourself out there in anyway it's that we don't feel like our own ideas are worth anything because they're all right here then we come across them somewhere and now they feel radio kits with answer nothing that I I keep on trying to remind myself of any time I get this imposter syndrome springing up that was obvious to me was obvious to us can be amazing tell this story that happened a few years ago in 2017 when I was in my 50 or medical school at Cambridge and I was one of the two directors the hospital pantomime every year the medical school which involves about a hundred people musicians and cost members and singers and like set designers and artists coming together to make this like comedy production. I had absolutely no experience acting theater type stuff is an area of life that I basically never ever done before and will he was yellow director had loads of experience by this like you've been doing theater for like a decade of this point and he was really good at acting very good singing and knew what being a director actually meant random but do you want to be the director alongside me I was like that sounds like it would be fun but then getting into the rehearsal and actually starting to do it I really had a message sent to imposter syndrome because there was there with me would like zero experience alongside this guy who had like 10 + years of experience I had no idea what I was doing and I would feel really self-conscious during the warm-up exercises like you know we'd get people to do silly things and test it warm up and be like is warming up the active in the fingers and it was it was it was down to the directions to leave the warm-ups and I remember I was doing the in my head thinking oh my God I was doing nothing people with what we're following the warm-up and it was it was like a magical feeling cuz everyone knows that I'm a complete forward compatibility lines are tweaking things are even unit giving giving some feedback to the singer's every time I would say it and was getting my heart would be funny because I'd be like why is anyone going to listen to me they will know that I have zero experience in this kind of thing this is a perfect illustration of the spotlight effect which is this kind of psychological phenomenon where we all walk around life thinking of there is a spotlight trained on us and that other people are looking at us and judging us and like you know any faux pas any mistake that we make other people are going to see him anastrophe week of having this anxiety about leaving warm ups or about giving people feedback I realized that actually everyone is worried about themselves like the cost of worried that they're going to mess up their own lines the thing as a wired they didn't get enough the course of worried that the dogs move the dumpster for trying to get it off everyone was super concerned about their own performance activity wanted feedback to be the best they could and no one was thinking about me like it wasn't about me it was it was it was about kind of the production as a whole and trying to get the best out of everyone pulling back into the spotlight effect thinking oh my God they were just concerned about themselves and say what I found helpful that was to try and get out of my own head I appreciate that no one is judging you everyone is just you know worried about the performance so you do your job and they'll associating myself and my sort of my my sense of self from the roll meant that I could step into the role of being the director and this is something that we have to do if you are let say you're very Junior. maybe one week into into irkngthand in a patient's of treating you as if you are the doctor and inside I would always feel like but yeah my graduate from Mexico like last week I know I know absolutely nothing but in that position you have to step into the role of the Ducks at the patient isn't thinking about having you as an individual they're thinking about themselves and they want you to do your job as the doctor and I don't have to remind myself that that you know no one knows that I'm just a week out of med school and I know what I'm doing more or less and I can also help when I don't know what I'm doing this isn't about me in the Bud Light effect into account and I found them is another thing has really helped me deal with imposter syndrome that I get around these sorts of scenarios and overcoming imposter syndrome challenge of separating ourselves from the role that we're playing on cell king of feelings from what actually going on just worried about himself which I think is extremely liberating and you know what else is doing online courses signs of computer science interactive and engaging and fun and they teach you the principles of the subject in a very high first principles passion which is similar to the style of teaching at Oxford and Cambridge where you have a small group of people you learn a little bit about something and then you got thrown into a sizes to engage remind to make you have fun and you get feedback on it and it's like a really fantastic way to that I've been using pregnant for over a year now and I'm going through Delta that courses on math and computer science in particular the one I'm taking right now is all about cryptocurrencies in about how cryptographic signatures Wild in a currencies like Bitcoin even exist and if you're interested in learning how to code able to have really good courses on python which of the world's most popular programming language the annual premium subscription is something that I'm actually going through right now and it's a time I'm feeling it very strongly with the book that I'm in the process of writing a few months ago I got approached by an editor from pain UK you said hey are you interested in writing a book about productivity and initially I was like absolutely not because I didn't think that I had anything useful to say about productivity I feel like I've already said it and bitter videos and I don't really have any original ideas well I'm doing is unipower what is the temperature for David Allen in for I work week or and getting things done these other people have already come up with the idea that all I'm doing is making videos about them other than that one of the things I'm still struggling with his units question of what's the point of productivity like I've been chasing for a efficiency and passive income Financial Independence for the last eight years and now that I'm kind of hit that point I buy take type take that box where I don't need to work instead of what is optional end up taking a break from Edison now I've got the sense of what the hell am I doing with my life and continue to try and be productive to make more YouTube videos by making courses or try to make more money like what's the point of it all and I realize that this is actually one of the angle that one x 4 in the book it's like I think there are plenty of books out there about how to get more done for the thing that I'm I actually want to know is how do we figure out what we want to get done and how do we figure out with meaningful to us and what our purpose is in you know all of that stuff that in the past I used to think was a bit like why the hell would anyone listen to me as a twenty-six-year-old you know random dude who makes videos on the internet about how to find what the meaningful and how to find was purposeful and how to figure out what your values and vision are and you know how to be more productive device that might writing coach gave which I think about basically every day is that you don't have to be a guru you can be a guide know the difference between the two so agru is someone who comes down from the top of the mountain and says look at me I'm the expert I have all the answers where is a guy is someone who is on the same Journey as you and a guy says hey I don't have the answers but we're on the same path why don't we kind of approached it together and I'll I'll show you what I've discovered so far and I found that framing of it like guide rather than Guru has really helped me over some of my imposter syndrome associated with writing the book because the way I'm approaching it it's not that look at me I'm the expert about all things productivity I'm the expert on how to figure out what to do with your life it's more a case of I don't really know what to do with my life but Reynolds books about productivity and so why don't we explore together Ami me and the radar like what other people have written on the topic and what studies have been done about meaning and purpose and you know how productivity fits into this idea of figuring out what to do with aloe and then figuring out how we can do it efficiently the more I think about it the more I See This Groove us as guide thing play out in another aspect of life as well as like basically everyone in my part-time YouTuber Padme who's struggling with getting the YouTube channel of the ground during the YouTube channel suffers from this syndrome of well I'm an expert about the thing before I'm not allowed to teach people about the thing but the key thing that I always have to remind myself of is that you don't need to be an expert like I don't have to pretend to be a guru I kind of be a guide and I can help people you know explore you know I'm going the same Johnny that I've been going on and I seriously I've been reading the scientific papers and stuff in books about meaning values Vision purpose and it's a really interesting stuff and it's helping me kind of figure out what I want to do with my life and that's a journey that I hopefully want to take the Raiders if you're interested in keeping up-to-date with my book writing Jenny then I have a special email list where I send out updates like every few weeks and ask questions and you know I'll I'll send like drops of chapters and stuff to that made him as well. Feel free to join it that's the link to the video. and if you go to the end of this video I would love it if you can leave a \ud83d\udd4c your the drama mask Emoji you can put that \ud83d\udc44 in the comments because I'm always curious about who I've always liked video like that long I don't do YouTube analytics it shows that most people only watch like 30% of the video was nice seeing him that you've thought about this video or anything is reminded you off or any ways in which you've been overcoming imposter syndrome that would be very nice to hear as well 10 top tips for beginner Youtubers with also applies to other creative things that you might want to get started thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

special something we can't replicate and that's the secret Solstice what if it's not really about what if that it successful because of traits and skills that any of us can develop that's a question what time playing in this episode of book club the series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books and today we are talking about grit by Angela Duckworth why passion and resilience secrets to success Angela is a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and she spent the last decade exploring the idea of grit with examples from the US military Sports business and education coupled with evidence from Psychology and Neuroscience of ghost we often place too much emphasis on talent and not enough emphasis on passion and perseverance which of key components of what she calls one of the opening ideas in the book is that we all have a natural Talent bias Chico's The Immortal words of German philosopher free you said all vanity of self-love promotes The Cult of the genius for if we think of Genius as something magical we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking that he's saying that we will mythologized this idea of talent if we can explain away someone success as being down to just Talent it means that we can use that as an excuse we don't have to do the hard work and put in the effort ourselves in the book our friend Angela introduces two equations that help this sinking talents X effort skill skill X effort equals achievement that using algebraic substitution or whatever the hell it's called we can derive the equation achievement equals talents x f x f equals Talent Times Square not leave the store on the main points in the book that yes it is important but actually effort counts twice actually I think I could probably count more than twice because if you square effort it's like any effort you put into squared multiplied by itself voice of the main audio of the book which is unsurprising grits and Angeles done lots of research into loads of different fields and what she's found is that whichever Domaine we're looking at the most successful people will have these two things in common first leave their own usually Brasilia and hard-working and secondly they had a deeply held belief and the knowledge of what it was they wanted and she says in the book these Paragons of grit not only had determination they had direction as well she can food sit this combination of perseverance and passion leads to sustained long-term effort and those things she calls grits so now that we know what great actually is and the effort counts twice as much as Talent how can we develop a month quality we can all develop great in different ways and chuggie's it is basically four components of great that we can work on first date we have interest not passion is the first component of the grit equation but actually to develop a passion we first need to be interested in and enjoy what we do ask Jeff Bezos famous he said whatever it is that you want to do you'll find a life that if you're not passionate about what it is you working on you would be able to stick with it I think is a pretty great and this is basically the same idea as my concept of the fun factor which is part of my productivity equation that'll be linked Moines and there's another really good quote from the book that I often come back to and that is passion for your work is a little bit of Discovery followed by a lot of development and then a lifetime of deepening this is really good. my passion is doing I don't think they station or reading paranormal romance or whatever you're not going to find your passion by sitting at home like 11 you going to find it by trying out new things happening outside your comfort zone it's a little bit of Discovery then a lot of development and then a lifetime that is so good I should buy that is practice almost specifically daily deliberate practice which helps build the foundation of perseverance Angela says that every greasy person she's interviewed how did the Japanese concept of Kaizen literally translates to continuous Improvement but it's not just about putting in the hours of practice it's also important how we practice Angela Rules and research by psychologist and is Erickson who has studied Peak performers and successful people and found that do this thing will deliver which is made up of four components to find stretch goal I can leave full concentration and effort number three immediate and informative feedback and before repetition with reflection and refinement hopefully in body to body of Kaizen continuous Improvement we need purpose now imagine the scene 3 Bricklayers and they are doing that thing laying bricks and you lost them hey guys what are you doing Brix II V I'm building a church and the third says I'm building the house of God when the going gets tough which of the three do you think is going to have the most grit the most passion and perseverance always going to be the dude he's going to higher purpose behind the thing that he's doing names of a 16000 American adults to help figure out what a pleasure or purpose contributed most to the grit they found that everyone whatever the level of grit basically had the same pleasure in the stuff they were doing but the people with higher grit had more purpose to find a way to convince ourselves that what we doing actually has some sort of higher purpose and then we'll be more gritty and Angela said through three different ways that we can do this Thursday we can reflect on how the work we already doing to make a positive contribution to society secondly we can think about how and small book ways we can change our current work 10 haunted the connection to a cool values and 30 we can try to find inspiration in a purposeful role model in this YouTube channel for example I'm sure at some point in the future when I'm no longer driven by the logical desire for Fame and Fortune I'm sure that point I'll be able to read this book not be like you know what I need a higher purpose and a higher purpose behind making these YouTube videos to help people the rest of the expectation that our own efforts can improve over time so we can become better in the future so forget about this idea that our abilities might be fixed and we can develop this idea that Carol dweck called the growth mindset which is something that I very bullish about Angela says that water fixed mindset leads to pessimistic explanations of adversity a growth mindset leads to perseverance and seeking out new challenges that will ultimately make you stronger and important like absolutely everything is a skill absolutely everything can be learned that we can all improve in whatever we want however we want and I think having that kind of attitude like I've tried to develop that over the next two decades of my life is ready serve me very well so we can grow from the inside by cultivating engaging in challenging practice connecting a work to a wider purpose Beyond just being rich and famous and learning to Hope and cope with adversity by adopting a growth mindset if you want to become a more gritty and successful person blinkist is a fantastic app that distills the world's best-selling non-fiction books into bite-sized summaries of the key ideas that you can listen to or read in 15 to 20 minutes in fact the blinker summary of crate with potty what I used to cross this whenever you have a spare that you can hop onto the app and you can read and listen to sapiens are Atomic habits of the 4-Hour Work week if that's what you want the blink sulcer crucially come in audio format so if you're like me and want to listen to stuff at Double speed while you're in the car you go the ocean to him as well and so wanted you any to work I can listen to like 10 to 15 different non-fiction books like I'm not just forget about it then I can decide based on that okay which of these boots do I actually want to read in their entirety and that's like a really nice way of helping me filter down human mind list of me a book that I want to read into a more manageable short list of books that I'm actually going to read the annual description I personally pay for it I think it's totally worth it if you like this video you should definitely check out my summary of atomic Habits by James clear about how to build good habits and break bad ones.

And it started raining just a little bit unfortunate but I swear the 10th I'm going to say goodnight this place is pretty awesome so far everyone seemed pretty friendly and we go to workshops tomorrow morning and breakfast in like tea and hot chocolate and it's going to be in the morning eventful night of sleeping in a tent that go more more wet has not progressed I was not right off the bottle but hey we had breakfast and then Lights Festival welcome to the conference and we got few good things lined up as well you have Alice in this equipment Department that work together to save this cash dislike thing is you take taking a respirator right with you back I feel great about a lot can you still be in a military environment Hotel remember them like they got pretty intense pretty covid-19 guy but is very good time in the morning and then it's boring really good Yoda lady who were talking about like a military medicine and there was this guy told me about Aerospace medicine this whole kind of people doing interesting things with medicine but combining them with other call about cool. chill with the people in the in the Big Ten going to be great Five Guys Beckley Dino decadia still going on behind us but we're going to head back to the house and then the final day of the conference forgot pack up the 10 to grab some breakfast and then attend some more shelves before heading back home heading back to Cambridge well we warm and dry place like having a chat with olsem we made friends with this girl who had this massive 10 the reception that and we were dry throughout the night which was which is amazing appreciate how good a dry night sleep is when he's been wet for a night pretty good time price we just had some tools from more people for into this whole Expedition medicine thing was talking about Sanju deductions can get involved with this other stuff I kind of giving practical tips that we had a lady has done some like a humanitarian project abroad as a junior doctor told me about her experiences and ended with some guy who's been research on astronauts talking about how to cope under experiment may take a message from Ashok seems to be that if you want to be a good Expedition medic need to be a good Mountaineer generally Soto about developing their skills new skills and heard from your practice Expedition Wilderness medicine we've met people from low to different Unis had forgotten all of their names possibly my favorite new friends of the conference despite the fact that she was totally fickle good plates of food should go for a high five and sneaky knocking down at that dude sits on the floor we have a very very good that was one from this stuff today if you had a head injury off for snowboarding accident and he was a giving us some good written about head injuries and be what kind of talking about the philosophy of recovery so I quit from the Dalai Lama and from like French stop about taking things as they are I know it'll be worrying about stuff that was very good and then we had the same guy from yesterday the badass Police Inspector guy who does bodyguarding for like the royal family I'm investigated the Manchester bombing he was talkin about Mortals decision-making on a ticket through like an example of a kidnapping case that he investigated which was really quite riveting color had a wonderful weekend. if you've enjoyed this video a thumbs up below"

            "text": " a friend book back to the channel in this video will be combining some of my favorite things in life that's note-taking studying tech apps and specifically one of my favorite of all time in his notion and I'll be showing you how it take note to medical school using notion and we'll spend the video reports of rustic understanding that can be memorizing answer the organizing and as usual you find timestamp in the description and comments you can skip around the video if you feel like it thousand code that you can use to get a free personal plan for notion I'll be telling you the details about that sometime in this video to please to make sure you work the whole video thing you can catch the special code then you can get in Ocean for free learning anything when we're at University and that is number 1 understanding and then secondly memorizing and note taking itself like summarizing content with the book open of summarizing content from election in general according to the evidence base is considered a fairy technique for retaining information but there are a few things we can do to a note taking technique to actually make it useful as a way of forcing understanding and secondly memorizing to come 10 so I'll take you through my nose I am helping teach medical students at the University of Cambridge I'll show you how I use notion to help understanding and memorize stuff that's going to take a page and I will do even to took firstly I think one of the great things about notion that actually makes it separate to every single other note-taking system is the fact that it's going to be simple total thingies Associates give information in toggles and you can make toggles go as far as you want so for example in learning objectives I've had not everything that would go d77 learning objectives to the lecture in fetal circulation in fetal circulation we've got handful of this one is nothing in it which is why it's gray what is the oxygen dissociation curve ocean because nothing is great and they can take almost any type of content whether it's text images PDFs Tetra and it makes it look quite pretty okay so how does this little thing help with understanding anything it's it's really important that we keep mind what the big picture is where is it very easy like specially when it was so difficult is really easy to just like focusing on the details so for example when I was going through Medical School the first time around I made a mistake initiative always focusing on because the amount of stuff we get tested on in our exams would be so menu and so like a light ballast point is that was a detail that I would often lose the forest from the trees at the like I'll be so deep down the details that I would forget what they're kind of big picture is ignition pretty good way of doing that and that is that I summarize basically order the subheadings my lecture notes so for example he election number one is overview + why we need a circulation that's number two is cardiac function lesson 3 hemodynamics text control but within this I have essentially turned all of the subheading election oats into the rundal toggles so if I want to revisit electric cardiac function like an at-a-glance know exactly all the different topics who discovered the ECG William Eindhoven in Augusta swollen 1909 I have no idea. I wrote it a few months ago when I was like the first time. The great thing about all the details Within These totals students is literally just that horrible Creature Feature that like literally no other note taking app has it snow in OneNote snow in Evernote it snow in notability snow in goodnotes it's not like I don't even know what this is amazing stuff understanding having Bissell to toggle thing lets us basically have one of the big picture understanding of what's of wakanda is based on these totals and the second language understanding content is that basically whenever there's some extra information stupid easy to put it in the notes but again not lose track of the big picture so I used to have one with using OneNote and remember what I was using Evernote is if there was a specific topic that didn't quite understand I wanted to dive in emojis Hot Topic it would end up clogging up my my notes quite a lot about going with using OneNote I would have a side thing and end up having some enormous horizontal scrolling canvas to trying again exclamation to it but it's pretty easy and I'll show you in the selection series point where this illustrates is not six-letter open as a page I will talk about you in a little bit and about the nuns equation of the Goldman Hodgkin Katz hunting field agent that I knew I wanted to kind of make a note of but I didn't want it like plugging up my my actual notes so it would membrane structure for example I remember that water was taking these notes I was doing in line because I was what kind of going through lectures we don't necessarily know exactly what our ends note state is going to look like but that's another thing I can really helps with so if I taste some of the stuff that I I was talking about the history of membrane structure United 1774 Benjamin Franklin Bubba blah and then and then as we go to Ron about this Ryan editing Johns Hopkins I realized I actually this whole lecture is about by electricity and membrane potentials and the structure of cell membranes is a fairly important part but it's not like a key structural part and I realized that I was actually losing the forest from the trees like I was deep into the detail membrane structure that it was clogging up notes so the absolutely amazing thing that you can do in the ocean as you can just make a new page wherever you want and you can just put stuff in it turn into a membrane structure is a page at the blank page of the moment but I'd like on to it as make it pretty so battery to battery cuz it's else Ellis of like a battery that's kind of funny what is blank page where we called membrane structure is what I can do all of this stuff all of this stuff that's totally irrelevant to sort of my main main extra stuff and I can just drag and drop it straight into that page and so now if I take a membrane structure that we go we have retained the structure and the Integrity of water but we put it in a place where it makes the most sense so those were just some of the ways in which the way that it's designed actually helps me personally understand stuff a little bit better in a way that no other no taking out that I've seen does that was understanding this move will now to memorizing and ocean helps with that will be then committed to memory and has loads of effective revision techniques for doing that note taking is not one of them note-taking is generally considered middle to bottom of the pile when it comes to efficiently trying to get stuff into a brain the stuff that does work is a technical active recall spaced repetition spacing or repetition open topic overtime and I've done lots of videos tackling those in in in specific detail but in this video I want to show you how I use notion to help accomplish active Regal and spaced repetition within the context of taking notes because history tried taking notes by itself you know if you just popping out of a textbook what typing up notes some of that yet. Itself according to evidence is a very poor way of actually be taking stuff but if you add these supercharged Jeep it's too I think it becomes a fairly effective way of retaining stuff and that's what I'm going to go there in this video so fussy one of the techniques that I used to help memorize stuff using ocean it's something cool the Cornell note-taking system so the problem with taking notes if that's a very positive thing I'm usually when we read on oats we just passively reading them or highlighting them or writing them out again which is totally pointless and passive but the way that we can actually make all notes useful is by offering ourselves questions intestinal cells on the content message usually works is that when one side of the page you would have your notes and on the other side of the page you would write questions about those notes and so when you are going over you notes for other than just reading them you would cover up the side of the page that the ounces okay cool what are the four chambers of the heart and then that would be kind of the Ben Jansen like the single best thing about and within for example this topic of gross gross structure of the heart I pushed myself how much blood does the heart pump over Lifetime and at the moment I can't remember the answer to this and so I took on my toggle and it's like oh 205 240 million of what that's quite a lot of work but like normally what I be tempted to do is like I nothing to do with we would have this information sort of like as bullet points in a way so for example we could turn this into bullet points answer us when we see on those would be closer to the Middle Ages 5 minutes I mean but we wouldn't bother activity testing hotels in my information and so the fact that it can go straight into a toggle and I should just drag and drop this and that means that when when I look at these notes. about how much does but something like this is a lot more thing sir the girl stalks your blood vessels I would draw a diagram of blood vessel structure with the labels on it and then I would pick on the toggle give me the answer for the point is an engaging Brain before and I'm not just including the what is the Tunica intima made up of connective tissue so I messed up. It's about bit near the point is I've tried to dreaded this information to my brain for the very fact that I'm trying to record it will strengthen my mind made up of mostly smooth muscle Shuffle smooth muscle cells with bands fibroblastic tissue and what the Tunica adventitia made out of I would say mostly connective tissue like collagen and stuff the point is I'm asking myself the questions first and then I'm trying to answer them in my head or out loud or paper or whatever I don't need that my listing of Beyonce's and this is basically the Cornell note-taking method in action in Ocean and that turns on notes from a passively pointless waste of time which is what it was and what it would be by default into something that genuinely helps our brain develop because it's this is just so much research the shows that getting information out of our brain like active recall testing Motels Only information is by far play retaining that information then just rereading it and try to put the information in again so that's what I'm going to say about a video up there and description which is much like 25 minutes long about why I can recall that the best thing ever in that talks about evidence and shows you any Grafton all this stuff to really help drive home the message that I can recall his way of life and Zack to record the single most valuable thing that any of us can do to get better and I'm pretty good but cool to make it stick which is about the signs of affective learning and and having studied hundreds of thousands of students say that you know if you'll struggling if you're not getting the results that you want to get in school chances all you just note testing yourself enough to get better results in a very efficient fashion nothing to say about my active Rico preaching the last three years and I love to preach about all the time and that is spaced repetition repetition is basically helps us counteract the forgetting curve the forgetting curve it's something that was discovered by Chapel Deming house in the 1800 and he discovered that if you learn anything the memory for that thing with his Decay exponentially over time which is why because the phenomenon that you know when we learn something and we come back to it a week later we realized and sometimes we think that I'll damn you know I must be stupid because all my friends can retain the stuff but why can't I see all of our friends have that problem as well we like it's an innate part of her memory work that you would just forget stuff that you don't revisit so the audience best reputation is that you want to repeat the topic at spaced intervals of a time to interrupt the forgetting curve so that's a you would do a topic on day one and then you would do it again the next day not even f****** the forgetting curve but because you've interrupted it actually takes you longer to forget it so then you do the topic a week later that's just a lot so you did a month later and bites pacing the repetitions of that topic overtime and a basically getting a long-term memory video that basically talks about the message that I use for doing this I think I'm before I discovered ocean and prior to that point I was using Google Sheets for this method so I had a spreadsheet how it works is that I've got a list of topics down one one bit of the spreadsheet and then I'm writing down the dates for whenever I'm repeating the topic and now I basically do the same notion because of that we have everything examples of cycle Disney of retrospective revision timetable so the topic of us did you know repetition one on the 1st of January and then I repeat it again on the 7th of January and then again to the 20th of February so it was one week in between these repetitions and then like all month in a bit in between these two rap stations keeping track of when I'm repeating this equally muscles I did first on 1st January any idea when today it's the 25th of February at 8 today I would annoy I want to study human physiology I will look at my retrospective revision timetable and I will think okay what is the topic that makes sense to me so for example Reno I've only done once in total that's what about the kidneys and other than the 18th of February so I probably today and maybe if I had time or possibly repeat respiratory another important thing I'm writing how difficult I found the topic or rather how well I needed to pick after kind of going over it so for example the first time I did notice on the 1st of January I write it at two out of five which means I wasn't very good at it but then the next time I did it a week late for a ride today at 4 and then I did a month later right 2.5 out of 5 with me and I know the topic almost back to front and if I'm like 35 to send that myself know how was the topic and that means that say to the topic here respiratory was a one that's a I don't know anything about Risperdal medicine now this is very useful information to meet the house because now it's the 25th of February and I can decide that actually maybe my time is better spent repeating Risperdal medicine because it was only one at 5 a week ago I do that today maybe on top of Reno or maybe instead of Reno any idea of the overtime but keeping track of how difficult we found these topics so we can build all spaced repetition intervals for not there lots of people that prefer to create their own like study timetable and you can absolutely do that one ocean ocean is amazing it's got like 10 Crossing border dccu can make a revision timetable that looks forward a prospective revision timetable as I said another link up there somewhere I'm just notified of this method because it's too much guesswork 2 months from now what my day is going to look like in there for which three topics I should study instead I prefer to do it this way on any given day I can just take a glance at my revision timetable and I can decide okay what is the topic that I need to most to keeping in mind the principle of spaced repetition the idea that I should probably be tackling the subject that I'm least comfortable with because what's the point of revising nerves again that I'm at 5 at 5 I should really spend my time studying something about it two out of five one for example you know you want to be a little bit fancy don't want to do two out of five you guys use emojis so I fight you know I could just do it to Stars so we could do a star on this copy and paste it could be two stars you know this could be. and then one of them that's just like always. Thing that was a three yellow I'm finding the Emoji and that was a for that clit I'm going to Green and I'm finding a green Emoji I use whatever Emoji one and that's one of the one of the pleasurable puzzle using notion that the Emojis just got to do what you want but the idea is that with this method you are encouraging yourself you spaced repetition and tracking have difficulty finding topic so that overtime and on a given day you can decide what you want to focus on a little bit about organizing like ocean is really helpful for just like organizing everything I'm not a student anymore so I teach physiology and I use notion to help kind of organized my life is around that but I don't really have to go to used to be in that sense but I've seen over the last few months like anytime someone meets me like all the streets or like you know a conference over the weekend and like three different people came up to me and said I start using notion because of your videos play me that set up some like like you know he has hair time tracking my homework assignments visitation is all sorts of organizational techniques you can use in his whole library of templates that the notion stop but also that members of the community have made that you can just copy and I'll put it in the description you can just have a look through the sword some ways in which other people using the ocean and you can basically do potatoes templates and do your own thing track of my students students that I've been teaching about 10 students I hate you doing Thursday night how we're going to manage uni Neville Luna Seamus Deane for vaulting show occasionally I'll set them to do so hope Bank of essays that are taken from previous papers for gum folino describe the roles of sodium channels in the sodium pump in electrical activity unit 5 bus and Link that the topic of nerves and that is like an actual link within the database and that's another really cool thing about notion that you can have these links between the databases so for example if I were to click on nerves it would take me to the Snows topic and the really cool thing about this is that when I'm on the nerves topic it shows me all of the related essays because the dsa's database and the subject databases links so it shows me at a glance what will the different essays are within nerves have been tied with no so you know nothing Behavior initiation Foreman propagation of action potentials or list of stuff and so I've got some nerve both so they appear in both so if I take a muscle strain example you know you'll see all of the essays there's nine of them total associated with muscles equally cardiorespiratory renal and a crime etc etc but crucially to see which of the students signs he's a face to take us to the end of the term and I need to write an end-of-term report for one of my students and let's all go on run I can pick on Ron and then has created like runs on profile and wouldn't that it tells me all of the different how does the body respond to an Ascend to higher altitude interesting thing so I can see what I say remind myself and I can also add kind of extra elements to This Server example in the middle of runs scored in the exam with 80% in the multiple choice and I say we were doing a second exam I can just make the property for that and then runs, so whatever you like with notion I can just add whatever I need to do to organize my life and I use that to help organize but if you're an actual student you can use it to keep track of your assignments. So whatever if you want this point in the video then you're in luck because the continent ocean Hillsborough County sponsoring this video may have given us a thousand codes to upgrade your free notion account into a free personal account now the free notion account I need to get started with could give you a thousand free blocks and blocks like you know each of these lines is a book I need to be Pages the block and with any paid you like every block of content in Thousand Oaks is pretty good to get started with an ocean but ready for using it for any long-term you will need to upgrade to the personal plan and a personal plan is $4 a month or $5 a month depending on whether you pay annually or monthly but at this point special code on screen instructions on the screen here somewhere and maybe it was in the video description about how you can upgrade your notion account into a free personal account for life or at least for a year I don't have them installed by 5'4 for a long time so that you don't have to pay student AC or. Edu email address anyway you can just get a free personal account anyway because notion is free for students use so if you use the right email address you can just upgrade your account to a personal account for free but let's see your student country where you don't have. Edu or do they see emails or you know you're not a student you just want ocean for free and don't to pay the 4th of the month but what about my videos I still pay for the ocean coupon code for free puzzle time is grade definitely check it out before stopping this thing this is something that I tell my students until the time are the Pharisees as far as I'm concerned cuz there's no other higher priority than going to managing physical and mental health specialty University cuz failing an exam has no extenuating circumstances is usually a recipe for a little misery further down the line and you just pass the exam then lunch if it comes about easier then .03 understand physiology physiology enjoy the university experience enjoy the degree and the final priorities were right about him with the last and to get a first-class and so the thing I tell my students as far as I'm concerned all of these things ranked way higher than getting a first class degree point I'd much rather they enjoy the subjects enjoy the degree and enjoy the universe experience then they can kill themselves trying to compete against you know the rest of the people in the year to try and get me the exam results my students for whatever it's worth so yeah that's it to take note to notion in Medical School links here two more of my notion Team videos in 2017 or 2018 I became known as like the iPad Pro guy but not when people stop everyday"

Know that you pick the language that you want and then it takes you through a series of lessons but within those lessons they've got like subtopics I'm in the subtopic there but like rings that you have to feel kind of like Apple watch where at Unity get a hundred percent a filled up the whole ring and I found it while doing these lessons I really wanted to get 100% and everyone and therefore I was doing lessons again and again and again I'm spaced repetition you know one of my favorite like and that this gamification of the language learning was really helping me think the pedagogy that is really interesting normally like with other language courses are done for Japanese in particular off with the building blocks and then try and build them up kind of from that point on so you'd stop by Lonnie what amount is and what it is and then you'd be the new some grammar and then you'll be able to string them together but where that stone does is that it tells you what the word for boy and girl are you have to practice but then like the next lesson is just a sentence that they just strings everything together and the first time you do it you wouldn't know what that said was that sentence means but over time as you develop more of a command of the language through the stuff they teach you you start to realize and you start to build the rules Frontier on head without necessarily being explicitly told them so for example they might tell you that the word for boy is otoko no KO and then he would have paid that a few times and then they so fun and then the next day it would be but they would show you a picture of a boy reading a book and okay so this Petty means the boys reading a book and then at some point you find the word for book is Han and then you'd be like okay to the Hyundai of that sentence explain in words but you definitely can do a free trial but it kind of has you in the language from early on which is the way that we naturally learn languages like English or whatever play Emotion by having sentences spoken to us and around us and all that stuff and I think it's really interesting that Rosetta Stone tries to emulate that natural way of learning that's something that I found that was very interesting about it compared to other language things that I've tried talk while doing it like it says somewhere light on the on the on the expression to the app that you know you have to probably being a private space to do it because it does require you to talk and they've got this like fancy like language person see thing on it. Like they would read out the sentence for you have to repeat the sentence or repeat the word and somehow knows how well how good you are getting this and then it's very satisfying when you pronounce it well trying to imitate you know the Japanese were some kind of saying it is really satisfying and it goes green and give you like a and then he filled the Endorphin race anyway so that's part of the game of vacation but I also like the fact that it's kind of integrated it doesn't treat out of words I'm speaking as separate things they put them all together so I'm just trying brush up my Japanese skills I'm going to continue using it for the next year or so just give it a chance and then I'm not your video at some point in the future I talk about like how am I denying Japanese killed of improved but if you're interested yeah we're that Stone thank you very much is sponsoring the video you guys are wonderful secondly I want to talk about The Stormlight Archive which is a series of fantasy books written by Brandon Sanderson I absolutely love Brandon Sanderson he wrote the mistborn series which I took in this thing this video series a little a few months ago actually and after reading mistborn I read the Name of the Wind and the wise man's fear by Patrick rothfuss but then when I finished I finished an audiobook format left like a hole in my heart and I have to fill that hole with something so I started listening to the audio book of the way of Kings which is the first book in The Stormlight Archive addicted to it and this is what I listen to when I'm commuting to work on my skateboard whenever I'm driving tomorrow I'm going up to Birmingham going to be like a two-and-a-half-hour drive and I'm really looking forward to the drive because it means two and a half hours of listening to this absurdity say Claudia Vick is just so and I'm trying to resist the temptation to display on Kindle and Blitz read it because I want to savor the olive experience for as long as possible but if you I think The Stormlight Archive is more is more dense mistborn is very readable and this one is a bit more a bit more complex to have a few more things in your head and if you read Game of Thrones you know the age of eight interviews of different characters that's the kind of thing that the the way of Kings to Mallorca does but I actually do a book review series on the channel at some point where I talked about it and the other fantasy books I've read let me know to come and see if that's something you might be interested in the gold standard of travel vloggers is the impression I get from videos on YouTube the editing of his videos of his videos is just absolutely insane and he doesn't absolutely beautiful and so well short and so will edited and you know the good-looking guys go six pack and do backflips Stefan's a video editing and pick it up whenever I post about that people ask about this and I think in general one of the things that I like doing is whenever I'm watching a YouTube video I like to think about what I can gain from it show must never what YouTube videos just for the entertainment value if you do if you enjoy that attempts to Define but I think for me because I like now working a full-time job I have so little time in the evenings left to actually do stuff if I can be entertained at all to learn stuff while being entertained I think this takes both boxes and it's kind of in a way and efficient way of having a nice time but also then himself anyway whenever I watch a video teaches me so much about video editing what's his my year 2016 video allotted times has gymshark video quality time because the editing techniques on the way the story is told just gives me a lot of inspiration that I can then attempted to add to my own videos and I-5 so whenever when I'm planning blogs now thinking akeso in in some quarters video of like Brazil he had a sequence where he did this in this maybe I could have applied that technique to to this video this is not like copying he's doing but you are taking inspiration from the techniques techniques that he's using on the other YouTubers using in front of apply them to your own your own stuff and the question of how did you get so good at video editing but they started doing it for you and I've made like 250 videos and something that doesn't prove a time as you just keep on doing it but I think it was so watching other people and getting inspiration from them is kind of like subconsciously makes you become a better video and turn it better whatever you're doing because you're getting ideas and you putting them into practice anyway if you haven't already it's just amazing and I've decided one of my projects for the next few months at some point is I'm going to buy a crash mat from Amazon cuz like you know how hot can it be really cool if you can let you know to go to some cool place in Vietnam need to do is going to slow motion 20 friends II Black backflip off and maybe try and become more like Sam kolder are headphones these are the Beats powerbeats3 or Powerbeats cubed and these are headphones so sick of men and then you have headphones and by holding the it was mostly connect to the iPhone because it's got like the fancy chip and it's got good pairing with the iPhone so I'll just put these on whenever I'm going to the gym or whenever I'm going in a commuting to work it doesn't fall off using the Apple airpods for the last year and I absolutely love the Apple airport in fact I prefer the airport to these but a few weeks ago I went to a wedding in Manchester and I was wearing like a Alorica like a really Deep Pockets I put the airport in there and then when I sat down I think they fell out somewhere so I just lost them thankfully are these came free with them with the education discount so like your friend since about two years ago and I think that changed my life because what is headphones I just so much of an ISO user experience than wired headphones why headphones are a real pain in the bum and once you've done why does he ready, back to Wyatt the reason I recommend because I like to think of these as an investment in my future future sounds like a weird way justification I eat it becomes less of a pain in the bum to take your headphones out plug them in and if you can do it so easy. If you had a chip in your head that could just play whatever you wanted from your phone not be really cool because you'd be able to play audiobooks to be able to play podcasts both of which are in her knee has plenty to stuffed animals of the podcast listen to music if you just getting on the cello or whatever so having a chip in your head is a wood would be nice thing there is so much annoyance between having a chip in your head and white headphones I think wireless headphones are good so sweet spot somewhere somewhere along that spectrum and and the reason I would spend money on wireless headphones you can buy you can get like 250 lb. Recommend we can get these I think he's like a hundred funny but you can get in for free with education discount which is wonderful because it reduces the barrier-to-entry introduces the friction required to listen to stuff on your phone listen to self on my phone I'm almost never listening to music I'm just almost exclusively listening to podcasts and audiobooks and if having a pair of wireless headphones means I listen to you know one extra hour of stuff per week I think that's an hour that overtime will no compound add value to my life I've gotten summit valley out of podcast like I'm at DiBella's ground up show the Tim Ferriss show in the Indie hackers podcast if you're into like making software stuff like that and I think that wireless headphones makes it a lot easier to do so if you don't have a pair wireless headphones would highly recommend you invest in some I'll put some Amazon Link in the description below to stuff at different price points ultimately if you had to pick one and you have the budget for it the airport if you have an iPhone because the like link between the airport and the iPhones is just incredible and it's so convenient yeah love wireless headphones if you haven't already video anymore because people seem to be enjoying them sort of but also I think I want to move away from new stuff I discovered this month because often a lot of the value we get from stuff, as a result of like the stuff compounding of a time so for example the Tim Ferriss show on my favorite podcasts would never be something new I discovered that month because I've been listening to it for years talk about in these videos away from new stuff this month and more towards generally stuff that I enjoy with some kind of monthly theme maybe also on a monthly basis but if you want to hear from him or you might not know have a weekly email newsletter what every Sunday I try in the mornings but you know every Sunday without fail for the lost like 17 weeks 18 weeks almost 5 months the email I give a little snippet of like the life advice or something I've learned that week that's also sometimes include links to interesting things I've discovered so that's kind of a more real-time monthly or weekly favorite soda thing different I'll put in a description of a half it's on my website, which you can check out if you feel like it anyway thank you very much and the next video good night"

            "text": " I have recently become addicted to this anime called Hunter x Hunter and it's absolutely amazing but the reason why I was reluctant because watching anime and watching TV in general feels to me like kind of a waste of time because I worship productivity and the only thing I care about is productivity everything in my life has to be productive like you know to listen to audiobooks at 3.5 x speed I sort of wished I could do the same anime and I discovered this incredible new method basically based on a Chrome extension cord video speed controller and this is absolutely change the game so now this is how I watch anime so if we take early episode it's always the Alchemist get the opening sequence of football so much like two minutes and then I go full-screen and then what you can do with video speed controller the extension if you can use hotkeys to like speed up the video or so the video down and so nobody will I do is all dispute 52 speed up until it gets to an interesting point and I'll speed it as fast as I can so I can still keep up with it that's what I'm pressing is impressing D to speed up a video by 0.2 times each time remember thing as too slow it down when it gets to an interesting point and then if it gets like a really interesting point I need to reset it I just press the button and then it goes back to normal and that's like really cool so that what I've been eating dinner and stuff this is how I've been watching Hunter x Hunter and then I can likely focus on it and it just goes so fast when it gets to when it's like kind of building cargo building stop until I don't need to watch at normal speed and then when it gets like a really cool 5 day cleanse order explaining something like you know about how the different auras work or anything like that then I can just press the R button reset it to normal speed and then I can kind of revamp it feels like you're playing a video game on messing that you should have liked working the controls here and there and it just like a more and more engaging more interesting way of watching stuff because it's only recommend anime like bleach or something that has like a big barrier in you watching the anime 800 x 20 minutes my life to get through this anime even though I really want to watch it now and now that I watch anime and I've been doing this for the last few weeks like 1324 expeed so I can keep up with the subtitles and then resetting it that is completely changed the game and I'm really looking forward to diving into more TV shows and more anime because now I've got this method for watching TV productively"

            "text": " the people often come up to me and you're just so great you're a minor celebrity you did all right at school and University and incredibly handsome and charismatic as well but what people don't know is that on the other side of the coin is actually a long list of things that I failed at and so this is how about some of my failures in life and 7 lessons that lets you see with my first official romantic video so this happened when I first came to the UK when I was 8 years old in 2003 in year 4 or the 4th grade and as soon as I told her I basically fell in love she was like incredibly attractive answer as one does to be a friend but I also try to play it cool and active if I actually didn't like her at all and my way of getting close to her was to read all of the books that she was reading so I remember vividly that she was reading Northern Lights by Philip Pullman at one point and so I go to the library and it was a very good book so I ended up finishing it way before she did as a bit of a flex the same table in year 5 and this was just before she like moved out of town I enjoy going into school and I look forward to being school because I guess the next to her and have a chat but and this is what I still regret to this day I never told her how I felt and I feel like maybe I had done I would have had my first kiss at the age of knowing brother than a day to maintain to be honest I feel like she's way out of my league she probably didn't like me back but lesson one for my Misadventures of childhood is that you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take if you like someone yeah you better shoot your shot because it's better to be rejected there and then then to live in regrets as I've done for the last 17 years of my life up my sexual market value by becoming really interested in making websites and coding I'm so since about the age of 12 I had three strands of completely failed business ideas Aion online game and so I learned how to make website that has resurfaced like coding in PHP for the purposes of how many times I got rejected when I asked a different people for commission about different things so on the 19th of February 2007 I sent an email to Robert muchamore who's the author of the Cherub series of books which already used to like back in the day this year is all about these kids weather being spies and they have like basic training and then learn martial arts and all this cool stuff but I emailed him saying I'm a big fan of you sure if serious and I have an interest in game programming I was wondering if I could have your permission to make an online version Chara but this was an email that I sent in from 2007 at the age of 12 and he replied the same day any idea is really cool the problem is that I don't own the rights to the game so sorry about that but you know that was cool he replied to me so that was once more rejection but ultimately I was happy about it because he replied to me then a few months later than August 2007 go on this thing of building my own game and I wanted to so to make it look like World of Warcraft and so I emailed Blizzard Entertainment saying hello I am currently making an online milk commercial browser-based game please can you answer the following questions about how I can use contents you are on my side 12345 I shall display any copyright information and old links that you want me to PS I am only 13 years old so you can rest assured that I won't make any profit out of this face emoji this was on the 27th of August 2007 when I was 13 and they didn't even reply to me so that was another rejection and then few months later November 2007 again h13 I emailed Nintendo to ask for permission to make an online text-based version I'm writing to ask your permission to make an online Pokemon MMORPG I'm 13 and I want to start of programming games like that this is my first one Nintendo will not allow anyone to use the intellectual property rights if they own this means you cannot use any Pokemon character all the Pokemon named in your game if the game closely resembles any existing Pokemon this may also be an infringement please be very careful so you know but no answer lesson 2 that I learned from my various rejections from Dee's light companies age 12 and 13 is that you kind of have to try some stuff you go to shoot yourself to be okay with getting rejected and you go to accept it when a business idea like making a is it going to fail completely and then you just abandon ship and move on so sort of like knowing when to quit with stuff and Adolescent already taken the rest of my life as well as the first of the three I tried to make my own web design studio I did that from about the age of 12 to about the age of 17 some of the websites that I worked on so initially the company was called UIA Web Solutions this was around 2006 when I was 12 years old this is what it looks like you are able by the way it stands for United intelligence agency this was me and my friends from school thinking that we were going to create our own kids intelligence agency where we would have liked a forum in a website to teach people how to do awesome lock picking and packing and all this kind of stuff and I thought I'd make a web design studio arm out of this when I was 12 professional websites now only half price wanna guess I feel company want to get a personal home page 1 of professional eyes website URL a Web Solutions is just for you and I have my home phone number on it I don't think anyone replied to this ad maybe one person did but hey you know it was how it felt then about a year later Solutions wasn't cool sounding enough and so I change the name is cyber Croft and this is a screenshot from Photoshop from 2007 about what this looks like Croft and to the Future. Did really help with getting business I kind of like the futuristic Vibe of Cybertron I'm so sorry fire was what I made this was a thing that I desire I think I copied Microsoft slogan back in the day your potential our passion office saying this was my web design studio I decided to make it and knocks it or something like that the name that I used to use when kind of selling my freelance web design services online and at the time I was super addicted to the idea of Alienware PCS like the Lost off them and think he'll one day I'll be able to buy myself what was the one Man web design studio that I used to run or I pretended like I was a big a company that I actually was and on loads of different freelance website that was one cool to get that I used a lot I apply to I think at least 100 maybe even two hundred different project essentially the idea that people would postpartum apply to do that job and I think I got rejected from like 95% of them and I think overall I only did about 5 or 10 project over the course of the five-year in 2008 which was the ball competition and I cannot get some designs to that and then in 2010 that was about cycle Diamond Emporium that I found some screenshots of that I want to test nothing about a template online business about couple Gateway it is a scam all the service provided by few individuals who feel like games consoles are overpriced dedicated to providing free consult with no strings attached but this was the idea it was basically a pyramid scheme based on May 2008 Justin 14 I was like this console thing is cool but then I sort of lost interest in the consoles and so we had to do a Rebrand and then became cold I do a screenshot from that welcome. in which money plays no Part B provide customers with a unique 2008 until you could sign up for free complete an offer on credit to get your free item how to leave icons online and is very awful having the icon being cut off by the borders of the square and this website ended up making me 50 lb and I remember I was on the school trip when my mum rang me up and she said hey you just going to check in the mail 50 lb. It was just my friend who had like five family members in the house and go for their credit cards and signed up to a free trial of film which is so like Netflix before Netflix was a thing I'll go pay full-time 50 feet from those who this was like the first scamming affiliate income that I made online like I never really considered any of this stuff to be work and I remember when I used to get home from school I used to be so excited to be Domo Project online on the road do some more edits to my new web design Studio website stuff that was fun to me and I think you know I got a lot of emails from people these days being like hey I will I want to learn to code but I feel like I don't have the time and I think if you're trying to learn something but you're feeling like you have to force yourself to do it or you have to have call about the time to do it then you kind of fighting an uphill battle if you can find a way to monetize the stuff that you find yourself doing effortlessly the stuff that you would do anyway just because it's fun then Things become a little more interesting and easier enjoyable I'm not having to force myself to do any of this although I was procrastinating for the whole day for filling the video but I think that's kind of what let's talk about some other day when I was 16 I just finished My GCSE Zorro devils and I done and I remember on results day my mom and I we had a meeting with the school and I said hey I'm I'm thinking of of applying to medical school how do we have like a bit of a polite chat about this and at the end of it he said to me he was like okay I'm going to tell you something that no one else really is going to feel comfortable telling me but I feel you need to hear it and what he told me is basically I came across is way too robotic that I wasn't smiling I wasn't showing any enthusiasm for this medicine thing and he said that I had a very through stilted robotic manner about myself and he said that you know if you want to apply to medical school but you really need to change up your kind of vibe in your style because you don't come across as assertive likable charismatic person who would get into medical school and he didn't say that because I already took this to heart because I was very very robotic back in the day and from that point onward I decided to put an active effort in improving like my Charisma and my social skills and all this other stuff and that was stop doing. Magic because I thought it would be a good chance to put myself in uncomfortable situations and practice this like Christmas stuff and from that point I also started reading books about like how to improve your social skills and how to become one from now on every time I go to a talk or lecture I'm going to put my hand up and ask a question and that was like a baby stuff to me at the time and remember this. It was like really really really scary to do that and I'd be so sweating the whole talk thinking of because I have set myself but after a few months this became very natural to the point where when I go to university I had literally zero qualms about putting my hand up and asking questions or volunteering also when most of the people in my group wouldn't have had that level of flash. Level of not caring what people think I don't remember last year I went to a YouTuber conference in Belfast in Ireland power video conference time and I was asking questions and everyone to the point where you know people would be talking to people at the conference and they would they would hear my voice and say oh you're the guy who keeps on asking the question and I remember when I asked Peter McKinnon it's about how he works is edit or something like that and the guy next to me he was like 40-something dude it was like a professional videographer he said to me that's a really good question I really wanted to ask him but I was to schedule and I think that's still such a thing you're putting ourselves out there in like putting her hand up in a conference announcing a question and I'm really glad for the fact that I had lost her when I was 16 told me I need to become less of a robot and so I actively put in the work to change that about myself is this whole thing of be yourself it's kind of old BS because who we are like ourselves is purely an accident based on our genetics and the environment that we've grown up with most of us don't actively choose what we want our personality or a Anthony for me before I was told this my vibin who I was was very low energy very generally known confident and I actually put in the effort to changing myself and so that's number four is so you know don't just be yourself Choose Yourself and then if you wanted me the way or that's fine but if you don't want to you don't have to and you can absolutely change it then we come to age 18 lb what does my entire life savings to some guy whose name was Matthew white a brand new Macbook Air I decided this was going to be my first diversity I was about to start my first year Medical School Cambridge was selling a suit of spec top version of the MacBook Air which would have normally cost 18 lb and so the two years of life savings that I sounds together from doing private tutoring and working like a part-time job I withdraw Rolling Cash had to move the cash and his laptop and it was super happy about it and I was super happy about it for about half an hour and then on the train ride back home I kind of had a bit of a look at it and I found it said like somewhere on the thing it said copyright 2008 and I realize this was in 2012 I realized that he'd actually sold me the four-year-old version of the MacBook Air which was completely obsolete because it made me leave some did not full yet I just hadn't realized it because I just couldn't believe him and he seems legit and he has a notebook with the Twitter logo on it and he said he worked at Twitter I was like little slightly different to the design was different but he said it was the European and a few red flags just not enough for me to to flip that script in my head were right you know where I just automatically trusted him and so when I go home like unibrow what is this is this is another thing that you use Ultimate Weapon on her pounds can have my money back on for around the month he was kind of stringing you along and emails being like a story I didn't realize this closed and ended up going on for about a month and I think he must have been really enjoying himself like soda pulling the strings of this like 18 year old kid wanted to buy his first MacBook line was going to drive down to Somerset where he lived in in a soak him some papers to send him to small claims court to try and get money back and my mom Drake on date so realized that I was waiting too much of my life on this guy and so she said you know what forget about this guy University here at the 900 pounds and she just bought me a new Macbook from the Apple store which I will be forever grateful for that amount everything else but if it sounds too good to be true it probably is over the last few years of an email from people who have taken these online courses on how to get rich quickly and end in this kind of stuff and everyone is looking for a get-rich-quick scheme for those back in the day when I was younger but I didn't what I realized after this event is everyone is an economist no one is going to be sending you something everyone is looking out for the road custom game has blindly trust people about picking up red flags amongst people who have feelings with all this money in my entire life savings and I decided I needed to figure out a way to make this money back and so it was a screenshot for my Evernote from September 2000 money making schemes what am I good at I thought it was good academics teaching web design graphic design could a levels good gcses and beehives and I said can I use any of that stuff to make money to drink I also suggested I might be able to build computers for much cheaper than equivalent specs I thought I might potentially make a website on how to get into medicine a website to be my preparation interview preparation and this kind of brainstorm nodded on Evernote to try and recoup back does not I'm lost on this thing this ended up moving into the company six men that I found it yet I turn in 2013 and since then the company has been doing basically six figures and revenue every year we've helped thousands of students attend medical school we offered bursaries 200 it would have been able to afford posted otherwise answer key to lesson from this the first one which is best number 6 use your unfair Advantage is the to unfried Montana's I had when setting up 6 I was a medical student at Cambridge University and I could therefore trade off of the brand name value of that that was a big unfair Advantage II Lee I have the unfair advantage that for the last 6 years of my life I had been spending hours and I would each day doing web design graphic designer how to coat and so when it came to making a website that look pretty I have the unfair advantage that I can make a website to look pretty and at the time in in 2012-2013 every other competitor in the space of helping people get into med school they all had really really crap looking website because at the time it wasn't as easy to make a pretty looking website as it is now and so this is now the advice that I give to people when they come with me and Lena ask about will this business ideas exceed you know what can I do to make money online order the stuff that I say that well you kind of want to use you what do you have that would be very difficult if not impossible for other people to replicate and you want to figure out some way of using those because what you don't want to do is you don't want to be at a note Arundel Medical student who knows how to code who then rate the website builder for something right because there's no unfair Advantage see that you've got it you're trying to go to website builder compared to anyone else where is if you try to do something specific in the medical field then the fact that you're a medic who knows how to code will actually be its own unfair advantage 900 pounds I lost which was absolutely devastating and hear my life savings of the time that's turned into something very different and so initially intended to 6 Meadow to my company and then because I wanted to do content marketing for 6 Metacritic 2017 initially making videos about the beam at and about interview preparation which were things that I brainstormed five years back in 2012 as this is the sort of stuff that I think I'm good at maybe I could build a website picture on this and the time all this money that like this is the worst thing that ever happened to me quite a privilege thing that ever happened to me I remember thinking that what I want to do now is I want to find a way of turning this into a positive I would look back on this time and think you know what I'm really glad this happened to me because I was able to turn it into something much bigger and so that loss of money initially started at 6 mad which kind of late to be starting a YouTube channel and here I am now having taking a break from doing full-time medicine because essentially the sound of making so much money that I can afford to travel the world and, do I want a way of the final lesson that I want to share in this video when you do have failures and we are going to have feta sometimes time we want to do our best to find ways of turning them into a positive sometimes a failure will just randomly become a positive thing that you can look back on in a few years time and think I'm pretty glad that happened but it wasn't random I actively sets out to turn this failure into an opportunity in the book The obstacle is the way stoicism and how you can use it to be happier healthier and more productive answer those with seven lessons from my teenage years I still got as we haven't really talked about anything that happened at University and Shuffle when you interested in hearing more about my CV of failures and comment down below if you have any questions about failure than stuff then we'll do that and academic failures at University when I suddenly realized"

            "text": " took before I did the Keisha YouTuber thing and bought a Tesla Model 3 I was really worried about the road trip situation would it be reasonable to take the car on long road trips and how much hassle would it be to charge the car would I be worried about running out of battery Midway through the trip how comfortable would it be and how would the orthopod at 1 real life so this is the video I wish I would have seen before both the car it is not a review of the Tesla Model 3 it's a review of what it's like to take the Tesla Model 3 on a 1400 mile road trip to the Scottish Highlands in torrential rain and freezing weather with a car full of five people I will tell you upfront it was an interesting experience for a lot of different reasons so let's start with the good stuff and then we'll talk about the not-so-good stuff so that start with Comfort acceleration and autopilot is really comfortable to driver when you sit down in the seat it genuinely feels like you're sitting on a sofa and it's got like fancy electronic speed control so you can set up the height to whatever you like you can raise the seat up and down it's even got a lumbar back support thing that you can sort of use disorder call yourself if you get in exactly the right position and 3D kind of leaned back against it but in general it's very very solid and very comfortable car is really not good for the back pain histamine after about two hours of driving I was getting consistent had a lower back pain and this will happen in my old car as well so I think maybe that's just me but the Tesla Model 3 did not kill my lower back pain problem opposite position for 2 hours pretty good because you can save different like a driver configurations to the car so if I'm driving I have my seat in a certain position but then if my mom wants to drive if she can just sit at her profile and the car will like the seafood automatically move in until it mission that she wants a roll Comfort nothing to complain about I do genuinely enjoy driving the car and genuinely feels right comfortable and just in general going to driving the Tesla Model 3 I kind of feel like it feels like a joy to drive and I think that's probably because of the Comfort let's talk about acceleration now and then absolutely ridiculous I've got the Tesla Model 3 long-range version so I did not pay for the performance version and have not paid for any acceleration upgrade the note to 60 of my version without any upgrade is 3.4 seconds + from 02 60in it feels genuinely sickening a times and occasionally when I get to have new people in the car in someone's like oh hey I've heard acceleration is ready fast can can we can we try it out and let you sure about this like we sit down we get the COS of 0 and then Florida acceleration go straight people with the acceleration standard and its acceleration chill now I have to prefer to drive it on acceleration where the acceleration is more manageable that feels like a smooth the drive where is an acceleration standard that's when you really notice it when your laxative at a traffic light and there are three cars and you're all going in the same direction at that point I could stand it and I'm like all right let it wake up how to write resume so far ahead of everyone else leave them in my dust or whatever the phrases be at the federation's absolutely mental I think it's another software software upgrade that makes it go up to 2.9 second 268 I think 3.4 seconds is 2. Estimate for me I don't want you to call Guy of a conservative little bit vanilla and so I'm not going to pay for this 1500 pound 2.9 second acceleration upgrades which is completely unnecessary what is absolutely incredible it is instead a traffic aware cruise control so what that means is that it's going to accelerate up to the speed limit but it's going to make sure it's you are safe distance behind the car in front of you and it's going to follow the markings on the road I was actually really really useful it basically function doesn't multiply that if you're on kind of a long stretch of road for a long time so I usually put on this autopilot anytime I have to drive more than 2 miles on like one special road because that I can just kind of sit back and let the call to and in fact on this road trip to Scotland we were driving kind of on motorways for 200 miles at a time and that was like super chill because like literally it was applied it would just drive all the way there but anything to keep in mind if you drink soda pilot is that you have to move the steering wheel every 15 seconds or so like the car with flash sang touch the steering wheel and then you just have to twiddle it a little bit and then it's like a cool you're still awake or still alive that's all fine but if you keep your hands off the steering wheel for too long then the cost off The Flash and Go mental and then it stops sound and then if you leave it too long then it was disabled orthopod at for the rest of your drive so it's like the car is punishing you and the first time I tried this I remember acting like bad feeling in my in my stomach was like I'm disappointed my car cuz I broke the rules of sorry but like very quickly you get used to having this kind of position where you've got like one finger on the steering wheel and you can just twiddle it when you see the the blue light flashing on your on your console thing and they basically means the car drives itself but it's not sofa leoda pie that you can just sit down and okay soda parlor is pretty cool it's on traffic aware cruise control so as soon as this cause in front stop moving forward without me having to do anything it's going to Ultimate forward Let It Go yep I'm moving hands just keeping one hand on the steering wheel just to make sure I can do anything in an emergency but otherwise just kind of chill and it work so right now the car is basically driving itself and I'm very casually giving the weed a slight wheel when it tells me just to let it know that I'm still holding on to the wheel and I kind of know what's going on this one used to very quickly enough three months and I really love you and you're Zapata and whatever I am I'm using it I still feel wow this is absolutely magical how the car is basically driving self so it's a long road trips if you're going abroad trips this is a total game-changer because do traffic this is a total game-changer as well like I said I haven't paid for any further upgrades to the car so this does not have a full self-driving mode or any kind of automatic Lane changes or merging onto the side ramps or anything like that all it does is it going to rain and not which is completely fine for my name maybe when the self-driving capabilities in the UK get better all be upgrading to that but right now there is not a lot of difference between non full self-driving and full self-driving on the side you have to pay $7,000 for it which is coming that's not the only bad thing about the autopilot is that you do get occasional moments of fear so for example when we were driving in the Scottish Highlands like of these mountains and down these mountains and stuff technically the speed limit would be like 60 or 70 miles per hour into the car would be trying to go at 6 what's the what is pouring down with rain and you know the road is windy and you know this calls coming in front of you and it just me and you know like you're on the side of a mountain where he go off the edge it would be a bad thing it feels really really scary to use the old pot it because it's still for us to get to 50 miles per hour and then he's like a so we used a little bit while we were in the mountains but for the most part we were driving a self it is kind of nice when you're in the mountains and going to do it yourself cast of into something but it just feels so scary when you were Wentworth applied is making you go at 60 do you go to car like this in our road coming out while I was in the mountains but it was fantastic about range anxiety and this is such a real thing I seen some videos about it but I didn't quite believe how much of a deal anxiety is not going to the long-range Tesla Model 3 which is has an advertised range of 329 miles and In fairness when I'm driving in the south of England where it's not raining all the time and where the weather is reasonable I think the car has abs change about 300 miles like I can get 300 miles on a single charge if I had to it's no big deal when we were in Scotland and it was windy and freezing and tarantula raining the cause range was nowhere near that 329 miles it wasn't fat so to 200 miles and that is such a big difference in terms of range we also found that we couldn't quite rely on the cause advertised range so when you set a destination in the Tesla episode of screen thing it uses Google Maps and it tells you how much battery things you'll have by the time you get to your destination and they would love to X on this trip to Scotland why we just didn't trust it because it was projecting we would have like 8% battery left on a destination but then we would have 8% at that point and we have to drive another 15 minutes identify this is what they are going to be able to make it to supercharge the next day I don't ever going to have like there's all these extra set of mental components of driving a Tesla are you ready already by the range especially when the weather conditions on Gray all right guys is a problem so we basically run out of battery saver on 9% charge which ran out and well kind of feel like a baby sick I found it in Spanish when we were on the road trip we tried our best to conserve battery apparently if you have the actual heating on it uses more patchbay whereas if you just use the heated seats uses less battery so we were kind of using he did say that it was pretty we have to do this juggling of like well how to juggle a kind of how cold we are buses to making sure we've got enough battery to get to my destination in time at the point where it reckons you're going to run out of battery by the time you get to the next Charger it tells you stay on the 60 miles per to get your destination with with somebody that doesn't run out with stay under 70 miles per hour or whatever so that was useful to have but again it was a bit annoying cuz I was like well yeah it's it is stuff that you have to think about that you really don't have to think about when you have a petrol or let's not talk about charging and now this is another hole can a fish whole can of worms most of England and inside of the South Bay of Scotland there are reasonable amount of superchargers and so basically whenever you need to you can always likely you never go to a service station supercharged the car it takes about an hour to go from 0 to 100% basically for full charge substation you can do what we do and just eat at McDonald's or Burger King or a Subway and just kind of chill 17% up to about 95% charge from 17% that's pretty good advice in England and you will see there are quite a lot of them in the south of England but the issue is that when you go into Scotland and you really don't have very many at all so we charged up once in Edinborough way charged up in Perth which also can a B Moore and an Inverness and the sort of area we were exploring was this sort of Northern bit of Scotland and so there was not a single supercharger kind of and west of Inverness and it was a problem because we were relying on Scotland's third-party charger Network now this is actually a thing like they've got like 30 points throughout like the north 512 route like the north of Scotland and you can find them on a map the problem was it that way know that you have to register for one of these in advance and get a physical card which you would have to plug into these charges for them to work the app for some reason that would be you because we assumed it's the 21st century charging features and so a Tesla Supercharger would charge the car from zero to hundred percent in 1 hour a third-party fast charger will probably take a few hours but would still get you a lot of charge but then the snow Chargers will giving us like 6 kilowatt hours 6 hours to get like 30% battery like that it was taking absolutely ages to charge the car part names for this is awful about this thing but it was one of the things we just didn't think about fuel problems firstly in some supercharger destinations for Tesla in some of them you have like 20 different Supercharger so you know that it was going to be spaced but specifically in Edinborough airport why we had to charge up on one morning we got there and they're old two Teslas in the two spaces to the only have two spaces and the problem was there was already someone waiting at the moment and we are at airport already to Tesla's charging using up the two saws and there is another Tesla Model 3 that's waiting to charge so we're in a q in Siri we could go all the way up to aviemore which will be 124 miles and take 2 hours and 36 minutes and it reckons will be on 20% battery by the time we get there so there any question is do we trust the estimation on the Tesla that were actually going to have 20% battery by the time we get there or is there a risk of running out we potentially go up to Park and then supercharged over that so options for an extended. Of time just to wait for other calls to get charged up think about I just sort of assumed that what it says there was a supercharger on Tessa on the map thing you go to The Supercharged when you'll find a space but specifically Edinburgh airport we do not have a space and now we get to the best part of the trip and the most memorable part of the trip that was the charging situation north of Inverness some of the time is actually completely reasonable amounts to register a car third-party charger installation and we plugged it into the car but we're trying to figure out how to actually download the app to pay for it cuz it's not entirely obvious how it is for some reason Nissan Leaf and he said oh yeah you could apply for this EV charging card and that'll of the first project we were just like oh my God why is it stupid to get physical card are there in Scotland that can file charges so we're going to slow charge using AC and that means we're going to be here for the next few hours and seeing around sky anyway so it was going to happen anyway so if we were relying on the slow charging of Scotland's third-party electric charging Network this was again it was reasonable we had to change our route a lot and we couldn't do what I wanted to do but in fantasy raining and foggy and Misty anyway answer that would be pretty Grim but we just spent a lot more time and service stations are in coffee shops than we originally expected because we thought this was going to be a road trip to Scotland slow charges didn't work either 10 minutes to the nearest French restaurant where I can do a wee wee this was where the range is not as advertised in the torrential Wind and Rain this is probably the most memorable and the most Grimm moment of the trip it was we were all wet and miserable and freezing and we had to wait like a six hours in a coffee shop for the cartoon up to the point where I had like 40% battery we should get us to our Airbnb by Nightfall and we had to trudge through like 15 minutes of episode of torrential rain and wind with umbrellas flying out everywhere not working to get to the coffee shop because we were in some random Scottish down the middle alright so we found a place to shelter in for a couple of hours and I'll figure out tonight with enough charge but Fast 5 hours later give us a projected range of about 106 Mi and the place we have to get to a is 18 miles so in theory we should get to a Airbnb with some charge Despair and those hopefully another charger closer. and we will continue this some what's miserable but we did have to massively change up our entire trip because the results serious anxiety have died there is no way we can run out of battery before we hit connect Airbnb destination because what you can do it you can plug your Tesla into just a normal wall outlet I got this charges slowly I think it's about six to eight miles per hour charge so if every hour charging you get about 68 miles on a Tesla Model 3 would you like to be reasonable because if you do it over then 6 * 8 * 12 is 96 you get about a hundred miles provided you're leaving it just evolved hours and often we were leaving at more than 12 hours and so if we carry just a long extension cable just have it in the back it means we put the option of charging overnight are airbnb's what does running an extension cable from the house all the way into the car park and being comfortable to charge in the car overnight then and a fact on the cars parked at home I don't have a supercharger or anything I don't have a wall charger I just use a long-ass extension table connected to the Mets I just want it outside so that the Tesla plugs into the main power supply to charge once as a service station overnight that cost 21 pounds 94% charge overall or supercharger receipts came to 84 + 49 + 3/3 what is stations came to about 20 lb which meant that are total cost of charging for the 1400 miles was 126 lb in 30 90 and actually this was slightly cheaper than my old Miss a note but not by very much I think it's cuz of third-party Chargers were overcharging us compared to superchargers but if I had done this trip on my old 2011 Nissan Note which has a miles per gallon of a 55 diesel on Route 17 people eater that would have cost 135 lb in 40p so we only really saved about 10 which is about $13 by getting Tesla Model 3 long-range rather than by dinosaur and next were talking about the passenger experience know when you have one or two people in the backseat it. very comfortable it's a very nice ride its shell people like all these white circle with the Tesla Model 3 is in this Noble but when you have three people in the back it actually becomes quite uncomfortable for them especially if they're like told so all the guys we have in the back or like between 5 6 and so recently told and it was a very very uncomfortable sitting the back a lot about how he felt about the Comfort level of the car turn your back is good you can lift your legs up and so off to the long days of driving like I would have it all back pain from being kind of in the passengers in the driver's seat for very long time the bus in the passenger seat would be pretty chill because they have like nice Sacramento be good for the three guys especially the guy sitting on the side where your legs are so tangled into the car because actually does not a huge amount of legroom because the battery of the bottom take up a huge amount of space so in a normal car you're sitting in a Tesla your your knees are sort of a little bit higher and so you know you can get the hip flexor pain you get lower back pain be things like relevant if if you're just in the car for like an hour or two but if you're in the car for like 12 hours of the day and therefore it's night we would put on this like mobility and stretching routine at night time to try and get the paint out of a box but I think about the passenger experience though all that they had the seats in the back of heated as well so I was kind of noble to USBC charging ports in the back so no one's phone was ever at risk of running out of battery next let's talk about the in-car entertainment and the sound system so everyone says that when you're in a Tesla the sound system is fantastic and yeah it was pretty good but you know when we're driving on motorways for extended periods of time actually is really really really loud and I was kind of hoping the Tesla Model 3 would be a lot quieter than it actually is it's like ridiculous require if you're driving it under 30 miles per hour because you don't hear the noise engine engine but when you drive in the rain and all the cars outside you actually get a little, and it just feels like you're a normal car and honestly I don't notice much of a subject it is subjective difference between the road noise in the Tesla Model 3 vs the road noise in my Nissan Note which also have the side of the engine and search what's the listen to music or podcast on audiobook while driving on the highway you would have to have the volume pretty loud like about 80% to be able to hear what was being said Aqua oh my God I'll be able to silently listen to my audiobook while driving on a bunch way but that is absolutely okay if you're driving slowly on University Road without the traffic yes you don't hear any noise but be driving too much where you got a thing about the ink system is that you do have that big screen and so some of the time when we were at pit stops or if you were stopping at a service station or a third-party charging station to charge the car instead of getting out we will sit in the car and we would watch stuff on the screen so it Go YouTube Netflix and when you buy the car get one free year of like Tesla connectivity and I think it cost about 10 pounds a month after that do you get like unlimited internet straight into your car which is quite nice so we were occasionally occasionally what clips from would I lie to you I think we even put on a Netflix show at one point that was like a surprisingly good experience so that's like a nice pot of having the car your charging stops something annoying and he actually looks like half or something on TV in the notes my old 2011 180000 miles on the clock. I've been driving since like 2016 I think I think the trip would have been less hassle if we had a petrol or diesel car because you don't have to worry about the charging but I also think it would have been less fun and like for us to point road trip wasn't ready to see the site it was more just to hang out with a boy than just to have a nice time and when you have this thing of this shed adversity dislike shed chaotic experience so someone from tagging experience when you're struggling to find cha the rain things arranged Agassi and the fact that the colors ranges Noel advertising cold and windy and wet weather conditions on the fact that you're freezing cold and soaked to the bone and your brothers not working because the wind is too heavy of that stuff we wouldn't have had that if we were just going in a normal car or if we'd rented like a fool or something more comfortable but I think we would have had a lot less fun and I think in a way that trip was a good bonding experience and it was a bonding experience because of the adversity and because of the struggle and therefore in a way it was kind of good that we took them to take a trip in a Tesla Model 3 we are planning another road trip in a few months time and it remains to be seen whether the guys will want to go back to the Tesla I'm all for it because the Privacy is really comfortable or one of the guys will just think you know what let's just hire 4 by 4 you know Land Rover whatever I just have a big comfortable car that we can just use for the weekend I suspect that probably the road that we're going to go down so that was over all the experience of driving a Tesla Model 3 for a 1500 mile road trip I enjoyed it I thought it was fun but suddenly not a stress-free experience you should check out the video over here where I talked about how I bought my Tesla half price or you can check out the video over here it's jokes about the delivery day and the experience of driving a car for the first time thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video"

I watched a few weeks ago with my friends and it follows the story of this boy from Mexico he's like super into playing the guitar and singing songs and stuff but his family don't really like the idea of him guitar because of some issues to happen without the Grand. And it's kind of has this theme of Music guitar and kind of Tizanidine with family and ancestors and you know what it means to be part of a big family and it was like Play It's the really really really hot woman film I didn't we were all kind of in tears by the end of it. Happy tears Bluetooth so nice and it's personally inspired me to get better at Guitar because if a woman's body inside and yeah just like how do I find checking out the film Coco if you haven't seen it it's Sabaton about entrepreneurship and marketing and then setting up your own businesses in all of that stuff and quite a few guests on Tim Ferriss show are like listen to one of his podcast called startup school and that was really good and I've been listening to it for the past few weeks and that's told me more about entrepreneurship about what it means to set up a business and because I have my own business I find that like I'm getting getting adolescents and I kind of wish it would have helped me avoid love the mistakes I've made an in running my own business but he has a Blog on his blood has been running for like 10 plus years now I don't know how long it's been going on for but every single day he writes like two or three paragraph post on his blog if you're into that sort of stuff and I'll show it to his top 100 of some kind of some interesting topic or another and he's very good at cutting out with the fluff and just and I'm trying to get inspiration from from Seth Godin reading and stuff for my own mailing list kwikplug you can sign up for my weekly email I send an email every Sunday where I talk about stuff thank you very much enjoyed it"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to the channel and to yet another study with me / Day in the Life video this time I've got the day off work and so I plan to spend all day being super productive so we'll see how that goes I got up at 7 a.m. and for 20 minutes I lie in bed doing absolutely nothing then I force myself out of bed and go for a we have a shower and brush my teeth or three at the same time actually productivity and stuff at 7:30 I make the mistake of laying back down in my bed and of reading random articles on my phone for half an hour and then at 8 a.m. I decide Open complete waste management and get up to start the day with some coffee and of course to tidy my desk. 825 I'm ready to start work but I procrastinate by phoning up British Telecom to upgrade my internet speed I figured that now I'm rich and famous Goodwill upload speed of 3 megabits per second at this point I make a mental note to remove that deeply problematic phrase from my vocabulary at 8:40 having done all I can to procrastinate for about two hours since getting up I play my Spotify study with me playlist of instrumental by Angus and electrified of cardiovascular physiology this lecture is all about the various factors that determine cardiac output and here's some of the concepts are a bit tricky as usual I take advantage of the screen real estate on my ridiculously big Monitor and so I put a lecture notes play PowerPoint on my own notes and notion open in different splits as I'm going through the lecture notes on the PowerPoint I'm asking myself every single Junction does this make sense firstly and secondly could I explain this to a five-year-old when I come across stuff that doesn't immediately make sense I meant rapper with it for a while sometimes helping them to Google and seeing if I can find any more information about that topic for example I struggled a bit with the concept of mean systemic feeling pressure and so I follow up some of the references in the lecture notes and stumbled across the paper that was actually written by what's physiology supervisor at Cambridge University and his colleagues in 1996 did some experiments on anesthetized cats that contributed to our understanding of how splanchnic and cardiac sympathetic nerves affect the amount of blood pumped out by the heart in a carpet I have a brief unemployment when I discovered this and then I go through the rest of the lecture and as I'm going through that extra I'm doing my usual thing of writing a few things down in Ocean but making sure to hide the notes underneath a question so that when I'm looking through this lecture again I'll be forced to try and act equal the notes rather than just passively read them this whole process of grappling with the topic and then doing internet research until I be comfortable explaining it to a five-year-old but conceptually difficult things this can take absolutely ages and that's partly why I'm not a huge fan of things like the pomodoro because sometimes it takes me a lot longer than 25 minutes to Grapple with a concept for long enough to really understand it anyway this particular session Lost Run 45 minutes before I sent myself losing concentration and so I take a quick break where I clean some of the kitchen and make myself a cup of myrrh Misty in the shiny new teapot that I got from Japan at 9:45 I switch my desk to standing mode and I resume work it takes me around 25 minutes to get through the action of 1/6 which is conceptually simpler than Alexa 5 and so it takes less time to understand all the stuff as usual before starting reading the lecture notes on writing down the structure of the lecture with the various subheading for the lecture used so that I could have big picture understanding of what's going on in this lecture before diving into the weeds again my notes are failing minimalistic and for the most part letting them beneath octave Rico questions that I've written myself for example when I'm reading about sympathetic difference I can tell that remembering this stuff already helped my understanding of the whole topic and so I tend the paragraphs in the lecture notes into four questions and I put the ounces older if it's from the lecture underneath those tacos. The not visible by default at this point it's 10 past 10 in the morning and so I decide to take a break I grab a snack and sit on the sofa to do some #productive procrastination and watch some videos on skillshare I started watching who is Klaus about how to build a successful driving habit writing is a big part of making good YouTube videos and I think it would be cool to write a book at some point and so in front of then stopped about that whole process while I'm writing every week for my weekly email news that it was you can subscribe to but I think that blood on skillshare my own online clothing how to edit videos and another one I'd recommend is my friend Thomas friends productivity masterclass if you like you can sign up to a free 2-month trial of skill Shay with the link in the video description and I'll feel free trial is up you can get a premium subscription for less than $10 a month my videos I still pay for skill check each month and I'm working on some more classes including one on studying effective that you can stay up-to-date with by following my profile on skillshare anyway this productive procrastination break ends up being longer than I planned so that at 11 I get back to I've got three extras left in this cardiovascular physiology series and I just saw that I'm going to bash out all of them in the next hour which gives me 20 minutes but lecture this means that rather than making extensive notes I'm focusing on understanding the content and only writing or screenshotting the bed the really important or particularly news me a quick point I want to make carrot that I think it's useful to convert paragraphs into numbered list for example in a lecture notes there's a few paragraphs about the different things that happened to ensure that eye muscles get enough blood and oxygen when we exercise in the lecture notes they've written it as continuous Pros which is a bit hard to sit through and so I condense the lecture notes into a numbered list of points instead and then I reorganized some of those into an order that makes sense to me and I missed some extra details using the toggle feature of notion which I'm going call video about at some point this means that when I'm testing myself I can say something like what are the five mechanisms that contribute to the maintained phase of exercise hyperemia and then I can dredge up that information from my brain which itself strengthens the encoding of that information and then overtime this information will become ingrained into my knowledge and understanding of the subject anyway because I'm an absolute Legend So I tell myself I managed to finish these lectures in around an hour at this point it's noon and I've been up for around five hours and I've done around two hours of actual work this is kind of because the story I told myself is that I've been studying all morning but Katie I haven't this self-delusion is common amongst literally everyone that I know we will think you look at me I've done eight hours of work today but then when we actually time it properly and if we were to screen cost us out studying over half of that was probably procrastination of some sort or well at this point I order some Takeaway on delivery and give myself a 30-minute break to play The Witcher 3 on my Nintendo switch this 30 minute break turns into a 15 minute break and then food arrives and so I eat watching random Youtube videos at 1:20 a solid hour and 20 minutes into what was supposed to be only a 30-minute break I decide to get back to work and make myself an afternoon coffee to combat the classic post-prandial slump from 1:20 to 2 p.m. I get down to preparing for the Visions I'll be running that evening a graph questions that cover the topics we've done this term and Chuck them into keynote so that we can end the supervision with some solid active recall of previous Concepts page of my teaching sessions I do have a bag of questions but I put at the end of the presentation that we can work through we get through the rest of the material quickly it's also usually quite a fun and to the supervision and must do in school because they seem to enjoy being tested in this casual way after this I procrastinate a bit by browsing Twitter and replying to emails and then at 2:20 I'll grab the guitar and decide to do some practice it's not really practice because I'm just playing songs that I already know and enjoy playing but oh well PS if for some reason you want to hear me sing you can follow me on Instagram when I post videos of me and my friends singing songs sometimes from 2:35 I'll run through some of the essay titles that I set for my students this week instead of doing an actual essay they preparing presentations on each of the essay titles that they can present to the class so that everyone Dunn's from everyone else which is quite wholesome Anais this is also a deal to me because it means that I don't have to lock S8 this week but I do spend some time looking through the SAT I'm looking up how I would answer those questions so that when they doing the presentation I might be able to suggest some extra bits that they can have them at 23 I drive over to get in College Cambridge full to see the visions and lost for around three hours and as an end-of-term treat we order some pizza from Dominos at 7:20 I'll drive back home doing some quick errands along the way and refreshing my supply of millet Corner banana flake yogurt which is truly Heavenly when I get home on land around for a bit hang up the laundry and lie on the sofa feeling super tired and super unproductive for around an hour at 9 p.m. get my computer I have some fuel for dinner because I can't be bothered to cook something on because two takeaways in a day seems a little bit excessive I think about whether I want to do any more work for the day and decide absolutely not and to write the rest of the day off tomorrow is my first day of work and my new rotation on obstetric so I decide to have an early night and so that brings us to the end of this study with me / Day in the Life video where there was a fair bit of studying early in the morning and in the afternoon and then the rest of the day off to my supervision was pure procrastination thank you so much for watching and please the Lincoln the video description because a pretty good and be it really help support the channel have a lovely day and I will see you in the next video goodbye"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to the channel if you knew he had money was Orleans madaxa working in Cambridge and then this video I want to share with you the study method study framework that one of my closest friends used to rent consistently in the top three in medical school and sometimes even rank 1 answer subject and he's a medical student at Cambridge University which is one of the most competitive medical schools in the world we're going to split this video up into three parts STL talk about what the method is and how it works then we'll talk a little bit about the evidence behind it like why it works learning theory behind water amazing and funny will go into the method in much more detail and I'll be showing you using some examples on different apps about how you can incorporate this method into your own study life is as follows instead of ever writing any notes ever trying to summarize content from lectures of textbooks what my friends say did is that all he did was just write a ton of questions by himself and then when he was revising he would just go over this questions over and over again and after a handful maybe three or four applications of these questions he pretty much knew everything and every subject inside out so how does this work into the laptop as I say these these were the documents that he made for each of the subject so we've got home which is physiology biochemistry Anatomy which is anatomy and threw a textbook and he's basically convert everything into questions to the first lecture Matt cell membranes and stuff so his question is what are some roles of the cell membrane then it was about Control Systems when is ballistic control good and what what's an example that scroll down a bit to what's another topic so we've got muscles has another topic what's it what is the size of emoji what is the kinetic State diagram for this why is there constant isometric for Bella 2.22 2.0 microns basically a ton of questions to 60 Questions and muscles for Cardiology we bought how many questions is this wow this is a lot of questions Mike how you write First Medical School 216 questions for Cardiology it was a bit of a Cardiology notes from textbooks but again never made any notes from the textbooks what he did was it I'm almost off respiratory questions from the lecture notes 100 + 158 questions about the kidneys and as you can see he's basically got an entire like 37-page Google docs. For a dog history just filled with questions he hasn't wasted any time in making notes and summarizing all he's done is just the right questions by himself and the subject and then he decides he's doing he wants to revise the Upper Limb then what is going to do he's going to open up his Upland document and all he's going to do is he's going to go through the questions one by one and ask himself if he can feasibly answer those questions in his head is already writing him down he just cancel them out loud on his head so how does a median cubital vein run out. I can't remember that I told what do the lucidum cells contain where they found found no idea I don't even know Desiree thing which two layers make up the dermis I probably should know that anyway this is this is essentially, like all of the stuff or not to me again a full pages of just questions is what we like to do by default notes for some reason we think it's useful to summarize our lecture notes or summarize a text book summarizer a revision guide and then I think the theory is that will read overall summaries and maybe highlight stuff maybe I'll Cassell's questions but this is a purely active Rico basement all he's literally doing is just asking questions and answering them so let's move on to why this method works and this whole method is based around the principle of active recall I have been preaching about active recall for the letter E the last 2 years and after before I go to the YouTube channel just like in talks and lectures and stuff that I would give activerecord is literally the best thing ever because active recall is the single most efficient study techniques ever been discovered there was a mountain of evidence supporting at minute long video. Link in the description and then the card up there somewhere where I go through the evidence and multiple detail but essentially will active recall mean is it's testing yourself and the reason testing ourselves is so amazingly valuable is because the way the brain works it sold based around how many times and how how much you retrieve information from your brain so we all have this misconception that in order to study we have to put stuff into a brains but actually it's it's it's flipped on its head if you could be able to the actual way to remember anything to make anything stick is by retrieving information from our brains rather than trying to put it back in so that's why we read something once and at that point the most effective thing we can do without time is oscal cells about that topic and the download the studies why bother taking a group of college students or high school students or whatever and they split them up into different groups and they'll teach all the groups exactly the same topic but one of the group still getting to reread it for one of the group together to make a mind map read it four times for another group that songs make notes and for one of the groups that would just give them a test on the subject and then if you look at the results off towards like when they get tested later maybe a week later you'll find that people that get tested the people who did the active recall who actively retrieve the information rather than just reread it will make notes on it those are the people that perform significantly better in their exam and again much more evidence in my budget evidence-based relationships video this is just kind of an introduction a Discord server link down if you want to come hang out with me in the evenings on Discord and we go like a little study tips Chat thing on there and it baffles me as to just how many people still off the question how should I be studying for my exams it's just the only light is it such a revision techniques that it it's it still baffles me that despite even like watching watching my videos maybe reading a book called make it stick really good book to how to effectively learn and watching any of my friends Thomas Friends videos like all of the evidence study tips is basically that active recall is the way forward and I'm watching on about this for absolutely ages because you know they say that when I read it takes about seven repetitions like seven times hearing the same concept 2 ready for the internalized that and I think like the movie in the world hear about active recall and hear about the good news that I can recall the better human productivity as a whole would be on the bedroom or Liza students would be because we have to spend less time studying and more time doing the things that actually matter to us but yeah how the method works I'll stop running on about this now let's not talk about the method in a bit more detail and I'll show you how you can use various different apps to achieve the same facts before we do so just want to tell you a little bit about this video sponsor and that is brilliant amazing Active Learning problems Community with online courses and daily challenges the things like math science physics computer science that sort of stuff that you can take to help understand Concepts like computer science fundamentals program with python data structures algorithm search engines neural network machine learning computer science multiple things like probability how casinos work the fundamentals of statistics and just like a load of really really well produced courses and the nice thing about these courses that it's not just a passively educational video like this one what it does that guide you through the concepts and then it forces you to use active recall to apply those Concepts Tucson problems and recently they've introduced his new daily challenges feature where are only takes about 5 or 10 minutes but every day there's a new challenge Visa based on math to physics of computer science I teach you a little bit about the topic and then they throw you into a problem and then you try and wrestle with the concepts in the topic and then he solve the problem and this is actually a similar format to how the education system works at universities like Oxford and Cambridge and as part of the interviews the supervisor the professor doesn't that they would give you a little snippet of information through introduce you to a topic and then I'll ask you a question about it and then you have to use your brain to figure out and some kind of actively go from state to be it's not the case that you just kind of gets information after we go to take it back out so I Rely pretty and I've been going through their computer science fundamentals course cuz I can sort of code myself and I've been cooking since I was very young since I was about 11 but I've never really taken the time to actually understand how ugly tobacco like the real basics of how computers work and does it. These days about like neural networks in machine learning and Ai and a really good accessible introduction to order the stuff except if any of that sound supplementing your learning with these interesting problem solving process you got to bring into Old Forest and the first 200 people to visit will be getting 20% off an annual subscription if you're the coolest afraid you can so you can check them out you can see why you like this video alright let's talk about this method in a bit more detail and one of the common questions about this method is you know what do you do if you don't know the answer to one of the questions that you present so at the start we've gone through an actress and we just converted everything into just questions text book and we just written questions for ourselves but then we going through the questions obviously there's going to be stuff that we don't remember the answer to what is the capacitance of biomembranes you know I might not remember that but the key thing of the sage method is that he never write down the answer to these questions he trusts that he'll be able to find the information in the lecture notes or in the textbook or on Google and therefore he doesn't have to waste the time to actually write down the answer for all the days and that's almost a benefit because it means we saved and it's been more efficient but we see the drawback is that then when we going through stuff it does take a little bit of time to then find the information in the right place but this isn't necessarily a bad thing it's not a bad thing by in order to get information we have to go back to a lecture notes because Ellis Ross in Cambridge quite well structured and quite well organized and so the act of finding information election notes means that will be like a wheel will be able to see what section the informations in be like okay that's the capacitance of by membrane and we'll see it fits into the bigger picture equally for having to go into a textbook textbook to usually very well rested because they've been around for you than their brain by type of people and stuff for finding information in the textbook again we're going to be getting that information in context in the car the rest of the subject and then maybe instead of just reading about the capacitance of by membranes full of read a little bit more about by membranes and understand the subject a little bit. I was right to revise the subject he's going to go through the questions asked himself one by one and then what he does is that he's color coding in red for example of hear the questions that he didn't know the answer to so that the next time around if he's show on time he want to go through every single question just go to the questions that he's marked read and then let's say the third time around if there are questions that you didn't get in second time zone Walton is blue and then the set timer on till just go with a blue questions so this becomes a very efficient way of only doing the questions that we know we got from previous day examen at some point we want to be going through every single question because one of the other Concepts and effective studying is gold spaced repetition and again I link my video about that down here I'm going to call up there and you can check it out more but basically the idea is that crying is an effective is it what was it short time we've all done priming for exams and I see if we want information to stick over very long time. We want to be repeating that information at spaced intervals to overcome what's Goldie forgetting effect of the forgetting curve that was discovered by goggled ebbinghaus 1800 I think they are more information Myspace reputation video It's All About active recall and spaced repetition and this method really works in that sense how we can see here is even color coded some of them in purple and I suspect those are the questions that he was a little bit struggling with on his fourth loss of doing these Twenty Questions this isn't the sole method that you can just kind of do once then forget about and then be like oh well I haven't done any work for a year therefore I'm going to run this in two days before the exam before we could but it would it would be cramming it wouldn't be long-term dollars that was where is doing this and applying spaced repetition to it would really be magical and I'll just show you how I would apply this method has the best thing ever been using variants of this method for a few years now I just haven't used them as well hesitate house because I feel I get lazy and I'm not great but he is really good at kind of actually doing what they want and the other day I Was preparing for a supervision where I'm I'm teaching physiology I'm so I was going through the heart and circulation lecture notes so basically doing a science method of going through them and writing out question to myself so again if you're amusing the ocean and below are falling so few my videos online if you if you care but I think is really good because they've got this feature which means what I can do is I can fetal circulation what I would have done is a written question to myself what what why do the fetal circulation III special what does the oxygen dissociation curve look like Bears adaptations diesel chance I've written these questions myself but if I were why the questions and not the answer but like at the moment I'm not really in the market for just memorizing information I've written the answer down to some of these as well again through a total books so actually I haven't been down the aisle to do that because questions that I know I know the Institute will. I know I can figure out the Institute or I know I can find the author using to let you know so then I wouldn't bother writing it down so why did the fetal circulation need to be special City that's because we need to overcome the problem. inside your mom you don't have any lungs at work that's what you need to get your oxygen from the mother's placental blood flow and all that stuff there for you need to be adopted a new hemoglobin needs to be adopted and your circulation needs to be adapted to try and get oxygen out of the mother's blood and I know this myself but I don't need to waste the time Rocky Mountain cuz I know I know and if I ever get to the point where I read that question I think oh I don't know what the answer is then I will go back to the lecture notes but I'm just trying to be efficient in minimizing the amount of information I'm having to put into my notes because set Anna's all the evidence shows summarizing information taking notes with the book open is just not very effective way of studying anyway this one what is the oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin that's like comparing which one of us is Beetle I know what it looks like in my head and so when I see question I'll be drawing it out in my head maybe I'll drown paper if I feel like it but crucially I've actually included the oxygen dissociation curve in this total box and this is very easy to do so here is a screen cost of myself making these notes cuz I'm screen recording myself I was going to make one of these videos and you can see that on the left hand side of the lecture notes open and on the right hand side I'm creating this document in Ocean and what I'm doing is that for a lot of the stuff I'm just screen grabbing bits from the lecture notes I'm not coming in I'm rarely writing about myself I'm just kind of using the screenshot screen grab shortcut on the Mac to select a particular area of the screen shoving into notion and then that makes it easier for me to find this graph when I need to see it so yeah I can immediately okay that's why I thought this dissociation traffic employment look like and then I can untangle this and move on what are the various adaptations of the fetal circulation so number 1 2 and 3 in a few different sections and so I just let you know what I'm going to take 10 seconds just type out what these ounces are but for example if I looked at fetal hemoglobin if that sentence didn't make sense to me I would have just taken I would always say go back to the lecture notes I'll go back to my text book and figure out what I'm struggling with why this sentence doesn't make sense to me and work out what like to try and understand what's going on and this all comes back to like it's all very well it doing Rigo Tovar welding specialist position at doing all this stuff but really the thing that trumps all of these things is to understand the content there is literally no point in just memorizing facts if we don't understand the broad principles that underlie them answer as I'm going to leave questions at any of my how to do effective studying how's it going through questions but trying to understand the topic and if we ever get to a point where we're like ooh I'm not quite sure what that means we will take the time to look it up because especially with effective learning like this is again this is misconception that learning should be easy. the best way to learn is by finding a really condenser of nose and just reading and getting that information into our heads but again it's sort of the other way around it's the more effortful the more hard it feels to be learning something the more we're actually going to be learning at and against people have some students what they rate how hard they found subject and how hard it was to learn about it and you find a do students perform better on the exam and learn more consistently and have that knowledge for a longer. Of time because as were grappling with stuff as putting effort into learning while brainstorming this connection is sort of like going to the gym and it's like you know if I can bench press 80 kilograms effortful that is why my muscles going to grow where's when I bench 20 kilograms then and you basically nothing's going to happen because it's easy so it's kind of the same with studying like when it's difficult we are actively forming Connections in the brain and then we sleep and then those collections get certified when it feels reading like reading and highlighting and making notes is really easy that's why we love doing it because it feels really productive we couldn't go through a pretty colors and we write down stuff but we're not actually using upright and the more we use our brains and effort for learning as the more information is going to stay next one what if he questions and what do they do again I kind of wrote some brief notes hair uniframe everybody alright Atticus piece of lungs don't walk information like makes makes perfect sense to me but for example if you are a first-year medical student studying this for the Simon looking at my notes utra to the LA because people lungs don't work like what the hell does that mean it's it's full of information that requires more context I know taking a video about this balance of compression vs. context text and I have a lot of contacts there very long very broad but they but they give you the contact they help you understand the topic where is when we take notes we have compressed all the information down and so when I see all right I cuz people don't start work I know exactly what that means could explain it to a five-year-old if I wanted to but it supposed to see that they won't understand it and so that would be a case of going into the into the textbook and actually understanding what's going on going back to this idea of understanding and then I'll just kind of done this for living Cardiology so far so Kodak cycle ever in the battle phase is intrinsic regulation what were Frank and Stallings famous experiments so at this point I'd read the question I think huh okay something about a dog hot dog hot preparation and then 1 increase preload Experiment 2 there is something that should be something there but yeah I'll just literally screen grab stuff from the lecture notes on the diagram just to save me a little bit of time but I think if I were actually studying the subject if I were actually taking exam I probably won't even write down the answer I force myself to go into the lecture notes or go into the textbook and find the onset long story short basically this is a matter fact of recalled and the reason he actually came about this method in 2015 talk at the University about how to study for exams cuz in 2015 I was studying psychology for my third year and I've been actively looking into all of this evidence based study tips and all that stuff and initially I was I was supposed to be giving a talk at the Islamic Society prayer room for 5 people because no one turned up but we made a Facebook event of it and suddenly like people started sharing it amongst other members of the universe State and then I think at the end of it like 20,000 people ahead of you and like a hundred people turned up to the event and so we have to kind of be like expand the venue and it's going to do any one of the college's but in this talk about to be told about the magic of active recall the magical space reputation and when my friends say it heard that he was like all right well done play on words like for the next 2 months old he did was create these questions by himself and the cool thing is that he didn't do that much like that much anal work for the rest of the Southwest on top of things but it was only two months before the exam in the Easter term that he discovered this is magical back to recall and spent the rest of the two months making these questions and answering them and Sir if he would have started that method from day one I suspect wanted to if over very long time. Of time for the whole year I suspect that would have been even more efficient and he would have even spent even less time study anyway yeah this is been a very long very around the video basically explaining the concept of if you want to do very well in your exams instead of testing yourself this is the concept of active recall taken to its logical extreme where you're not spending any time at all writing notes cuz that's the way the time you're spending 100% of your time writing questions for yourself and then answering those questions dredging up information from my brain solidifying disconnection to thank you so much for watching a video please give a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed Channel placed into the links over here to some other of my evidence-based study tips videos If you like this stuff please leave any questions or comments and I'll ask the side of a hill I'll get back to you on that front and I'll see you in the next video. My mom will tell what tells me when I'm drinking coffee I shouldn't slurp he said that is really horrible if you slept I could be trying not to slap and then maybe instead of just reading about the capacitance of by membranes a bit more about my friend but I've been actively looking into all this evidence that he didn't actually do that much what kind of throughout the year and Beyond"

Domino to actually maintain concentration and read and understand every word of a student essay especially the handwriting isn't great but there's usually a pretty good correlation between how could the introduction is and how good the overall essay is this is something I like to call the halo effect student writing an essay you want you introduction and general production value of the essay you know the handwriting the diagrams you want all of that to be fatty top-notch so that if an examiner is feeding lazy the most tempted to give you a high mark because immediately at a glance they see that you're at looks the part anyway at 12:15 p.m. I had to the restaurant bills for lunch with a lovely chap called Liam who are randomly run into outside the hospital a few days ago he recognized me for my videos we had a brief chat and turns out he's an ex professional footballer who's now a business coach grow and scale businesses this is exactly what I'm trying to do at the moment and so we arranged to meet up and we end up chatting about General Life and business strategy for the next hour and a half at 2 p.m. we part ways and thanks to all the tea and coffee are consumed throughout the morning I end up taking another trip to the bathroom I never let me physiology get in the way of my productivity and someone in the bathroom I have a go at the daily challenge on the brilliant iPhone app daily challenges are great because they give you a problem introduce you to the main Concepts you need to solve it and then let you have a go at applying that knowledge challenges of variation on the Sudoku theme and I find that exercise is my mind while my digestive systems in overdrive if you like the program in one of them or you can go through the relevant cost explore and more detail and optically enjoy the computer science courses that go on Brilliance I've been hurting since the age of 12 I didn't bother trying to learn the fundamentals of computer science or the principles behind algorithms and stuff so it's pretty helpful understanding that stuff at the stage if you'd like to sharpen your mind with a math science and Computer Sciences courses on brilliant you can sign up at bring into old phone OK Google Inc in the video description and the first 200 people to use the coupon code Ali at checkout will get 20% of the annual premium subscription isn't that exciting after exercising myself from the bills bathroom I decide to have another work session and head to my second-favorite stuff and that's the waterstones Bookshop Cafe I rather cheeky old Grey tea and spend another 90 minutes finishing mocking the essays and find that mocking essays is actually quite fun when you're doing it in a nice location with good Ambience and by the end of it I refreshed my knowledge of no muscles and cardiac physiology which is a good bonus at 3:30 p.m. I quickly go through the muck exam paper that my students and I will be going over that evening to make sure that most of it makes sense and then at 3:40 p.m. I had out of all the stones and back into the grand arcade shopping center to pick up bike the bike shop. Recognizes me from YouTube and actually has its own YouTube channel until we chat a bit about what it's like to be a d-list celebrity at about creating content on the Internet by 4:30 p.m. the bike assorted I've done a test ride and so I grab some donuts for the students as a Street and drive over to gut and college for the physiology supervision the supervision laws around an hour and in that time we go through the mark multiple choice exam paper that they all died yesterday on the time conditions and I'll give them some general advice about what makes a good essay at 6:30 p.m. I drive back into town talking some random Side Road and make my way to work and the Etruscan University's Mumford data for this year's addenbrooke's pantomime which is put on by medical students at Cambridge University and this year it's cold The Little Mermaid it tells the story of a natural sciences student cold is desperate to become a medical student and the evil octopus Ursula Goose trying to take over the world I took part in pantomime for all three of my clinical Years first as a singing troupe member then as a director and then as a cast member and aside from this YouTube channel it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life and so it'll always have a place in my heart personal favorites from this year where a parody of Shawn Mendes is absolute Banger treat you better which in this context was all about the NHS the UK's National Health Service and how it's terrible and how we can treat you better with Healthcare and a parody of the classic song You've Got a Friend in Me except they change the lyrics so it's you've got an STD instead for the on the 14th amongst us STD stand for sexually transmitted disease Sorry Youtube please don't demonetize this video the pantomime finishes at 11 I say hello to a few people outside the theater and then drive home to backup the cookies footage of film from today I make my customary nighttime peppermint tea and sit on the sofa to write the script for this very video #meta then at around 1:30 a.m. I decide to leave the house and head home to see my family lives and on the way I pick up one of my friends who's staying over tonight so that is basically the end of this kind of day in the life what I get up to on a day off work I hope you found that vaguely entertaining enjoyable useful possibly not but if you the end of the video thank you so much for watching your amazing if you like the video please do give a thumbs up if you'd like to support the Channel please do you sign up for free trial I bring into Old Folks like I like cuz it's also help support Channel watching and I will see you in the next video"

changing and doing my morning skincare routine I'm using the CeraVe moisturizer First Blood by the LaRoche eye cream to help get rid of the discoloration under my eyes from being a productivity Grease Monkey cuz I'm a minimalist and I like every item to serve multiple functions I'm using my 1 million subscribers YouTube plaque as my mirror by the way what do you guys think of my new glasses look I'm debating whether to get contact lenses or even laser eye surgery so let me know in the comments what you think finish up the routine with a few sprays of Allure Homme by Channel and so I'm not ready to crush the day or whatever it is the American say at 11:15 I had into the kitchen to make my morning cup of coffee while munching on a cheeky banana while the 3-minute timer is going to brew the coffee clever dripper I make a Charming cup of English breakfast tea for my housemate because I'm such a great friend we warm up some leftover pizza and a mince pie make the perfect Christmas breakfast then I'll head over to the living room where I sit in my corner chair eat my healthy and nutritious breakfast rush out the MacBook Pro to do some writing I start with my morning journaling practice where I ask myself what I'm grateful for what I'm looking forward to and why I don't yet have a wife this helps me prepare for my next phone call that mother at noon I decide to stop being a wise man and clean the living room while doing so I discovered the Christmas has been stolen and a fancy Christmas tree which was once so beautifully decorated has ended up back and it's nothing somehow I also realize that I'm on Santa's naughty list because no one got me any presents that's okay but I ordered a few things for myself which have now arrived so I spend some time unboxing the new remarkable to tablet and testing it out a bit some fancy desk accessories from ugmonk this is together a fancy-ass way of collecting pens and post it notes itself and on top of that we go to coasters that say enjoy the journey just one of the quotes I live by the set of 3 small somewhat minimalistic notebooks for the time of Donald S it's 1:15 p.m. and it's time to head over to a friend's Jake and Molly's place for Christmas lunch taking Sheen's fanciest cake that she made and the Christmas tree over is a bit of a navigational challenge but it all works out in the end we all actually intended to go back home to a family's for Christmas but thanks to the new tier 4 lockdown rules in the UK we've ended up having to stay in Cambridge and up until tomorrow when legally allowed to mix with one other household ends this last-minute Gathering of the tree and then spend an inordinate amount of time and doing a Christmas photoshoot this is a sort of thing I used to do with my friends at University which is about why I had so few of them but since then we've not really had many chances of actually sitting down and taking notes to photos while I'm busy practicing my Paparazzi skills is making the final touches to a afternoon meal obviously I helped a lot by filming of everyone's shoulders and being an Absolute Pest DeSoto sacrifices you have to make when you're in the world winning internet content creator food is served at 3 p.m. and after copious photographing an Instagram Story We tuck into a hearty and delicious meal I've been pretty much living off takeaways these so it's nice to have some actual homemade food for a change at 4 p.m. as well stuffed to the brim Jake and I decide to head around the local nature reserve for a walk in the freezing cold while the sunsets while we're away Sheen and Molly make a start on decorating the Christmas tree only a few weeks I wish we finish off around 5 p.m. when we get back to the house at 5:30 weeks so I would go enough spare capacity now to have dessert which its genes must a piece of a red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and decorated with a Christmas wreath of cranberry and I guess I know it's really weird having Rosemarie in a cake but Shane tells me that it's totally normal and adds to the text at 6:45 we decide that we've gone Board of speaking to each other and we move towards the thing that I've been looking forward to all month which is board games will make us. new single useful game which is kind of like an escape room within 4 game format we have to work together to solve various riddles to escape from the abandoned Cabin in the Woods before we get killed by the host along the way we discover new puzzles and have to do weird things like writing on the card holding them and cutting them up to find Clues we finally finishing around 90 minutes later working in harmony to get through the fiendish challenges by 8:30 p.m. when I really sick of social interaction and so we sit on our phones for a bit to catch up with the old social media Gina Melita field various questions on their Instagram stories about their respective relationship status has been at 9 p.m. after a bus to revitalization we switch to playing a variant of beer pong glycol Waterpark Jake and exploration games involving the consumption of liquid explains the various in hole rules and Shane and I team up to try and take down him and this actually turns out to be a surprisingly fun game seems like most people apparently play it at school or university but but amazing coincidence whenever people were hosting parties where the game was please put some reason I was always busy or you never my invite got lost in the post or you know I'm sure they intended to invite me to these parties but they just forgot every time anyway she does her best to carry the team but we still end up losing and therefore I end up hydrating myself with around gallons of water playing a casual practice version of articulate of favorite board game from your birthday and then at 10 p.m. after singing a quick dubious Renditions of Silent Night we put goodbye to pasta coast and head home for the evening by 10:20 we've arrived back home I think about winding down but I'm going ton of energy left so Sheen Conde makes us some peppermint tea and we order some Kebab takeaway to read a roundoff this day of healthy eating then I get to editing this blog most productive way to wind down for the evening it's been a fun and wholesome day of well mannered frivolity we got to hang out with some friends before Cambridge goes into full of tier 4 Lockdown from tomorrow which means we wouldn't be able to see anyone at all probably for at least a few weeks I'm sitting in front of the computer making these silly internet videos for you guys thank you so much for watching merry Christmas happy New Year I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hear my name is Aaliyah I'm a junior doctor worth in Cambridge and then this video I want to talk about how you as a student can learn content for the first time so if you watching this video then hopefully you've seen two of my other videos on this channel evidence-based study tips the first one is about active and the second one is about spaced repetition and if you haven't seen those things here and there and done blowing everywhere suggest you watch those videos first because I've had literally hundreds of messages from students but those videos have changed the lives and change their study techniques to the point that they're much more efficient and are getting much better at the Regal basically means testing yourself and spaced repetition is basically you know spacing your testing of yourself across intervals over time but in these two videos I talk about the evidence behind them and explain exactly how you can go about using active recall and using special petition to supercharge your study techniques and to make yourself much much more efficient at getting information into your brain going to space all testing of a cell's of a time from a lot of people has been how do you actually learn the content for the first time and surely in order to revise the content you have to learn the content first and that's a question that I'm going to be trying to so in this video the way I like to think about it is that it's essentially just two components of learning and that is Step 1 understanding and step to remembering so understanding plus remembering equals good good example for math equals good real life performance at whatever job or whatever you're doing and saving lives if your doctor or you working in that sort of money for a rich corporate Banker if you are in the finance or whatever you like Step 1 understanding step to remembering so I'm going to talk about those intern but first I want to make a point about what not to do and the biggest mistake I've heard students make memorization especially when you first get introduced to flashcards or to active recall you testing yourself as a general concept let me start thinking oh my God I have no need to make efficient as we know from the evidence myself is very efficient therefore I'm going to every single thing that says into a flashcard on Quizlet flashcard and secondly you're relying on memorizing the stuff you're lying on like wrote letting it rather than understanding the content and having kind of a mental model of your subject of your content in your head and that's really the key thing memorization but instead to rely on understanding the stuff and then only using rote memorization when you absolutely have to to nail down those random arbitrary fact that you can possibly understand I think the key is to Ray off yourself do I really need a flash card to remember this and I delete you want to try and remember it because you understand the subject rather than you just trying to memorize bits and Bobs of it so let's not talk about understanding and what that actually means how do you define understanding I don't know what the diction definition is I'll put it up on Wikipedia or whatever over here but the way I like to think of it is that I know I understand something if I can competently explain it to a friend and also that questions about it when you are able to make something to someone then you know that you truly understand it and that's partly why I love teaching so much because when I'm running a teaching session for students in the year below or arena for the other whatever I really have to understand the subject before I can competently run that session incentivizes me to actively try to understand the subject in advance question can you explain it to a friend or you know some people like to extend this analogy further I think it's Apple the Feynman technique can you explain it to a five-year-old Rio Casino and within a reasonable combatant command of your language can you explain the subject to them and when you can explain something to someone else take away from this video and that is the active recall is not just for revising active recall is also the best way of learning and what I mean by this I mean when you reading something in a book or 3 or lecture slides or whatever instead of passively reading it what I would recommend and we'll do the research recommends and what the authors in that really good book make it stick recommend stuff you are actively testing yourself on that content as you go along so let's say you've read two paragraphs or something you would stop closed my Scorpio look away and ask yourself all right whatever I just learned what are the key ideas can I rephrase this in my own words and medicine is very easy you think okay I'm just read that we need you not to give anticoagulation drugs in simulacra fibrillation okay why do we do that okay so fibrillation means are clearing of the atrium that predispose you to confirmation therefore we need an anticoagulant to thin the blood to stop them from forming clots in the left atrial appendage and that will stop them from getting Strokes why would why would a clock go from left atrial appendage to give them a stroke then you go back to the book and then you would read it and walk out and then you'll be okay fine I'll get that out in the left atrial appendage is going to cause a stroke by embolizing over to the brain or to the lungs or whatever and you are actively testing yourself on the content typical is not just something you do once you've done the content it is a fundamental part of actually learning the content in the first place actually there's a bit at the end of that really good book make it stick with you should definitely read this the end where the authors are showing like in a text interviews from stew set of used techniques like active recall and spaced repetition to massively to stop them off and interviewing a medical student who go into Medicine by some weird root that meant he didn't have like the basic science background and he talks in his book like towards the end he talked about how the only way he knew how to revise how to study stuff was to read stuff in the book and when he did on the Sunday or when it didn't stick he didn't know what to do because all he told her only been using for his whole life was just read information over and over again and actually what he says is that when he started quizzing himself on the material as he went along I thought that we had the material he says I would stop and think okay what did I just read what is it what is this about I have to think about it well I believe it happens this way when does this name does that I don't have to go back and check if I was way off base or on the right track and he goes on to say the process was not a natural fit it makes you uncomfortable the first if you stop and rehearse what you're reading and put yourself on it it just takes a lot longer if you have a test and so much to cover then slowing down makes you pretty nervous but the only way he knew off the cover material had established habit of dedicating long hours to rereading wasn't getting the results that he needed as hot as it was he made himself stick to retrieve a practice long enough to at least see if it works and then you just have to trust the process and that was really the biggest hurdle for me was getting myself to trust it and it ended up working very well for me Rise Up from the bottom of the class of 200 students to join the high performance and has remained there ever since and then to talk about how this guy actually started mentoring students on effective study techniques and how many people saw it coming to him to learn how to study this guy who was literally bottom of his class medical school coming from the background where he didn't really have any basic science knowledge managed to get to the top to the extent that people within asking for help and all he did was quiz himself himself as he went along. it's actually a fundamental part of learning material in the first place your weaving this narrative your building is mental more than your head you're telling yourself the story of your content as you're getting through it not just you know when it comes to the exam right at the end so yeah let's go back to DS schedule programming but of course anyone who's had the experience of understanding something like you can go to electronically and you can think of later you come across it again you like a okay maybe I didn't understand as well as I thought I did because I just can't remember any of it to the second component of effective letting and that is the remembering component and you know what I'm going to say here at the two absolute keep hitters of remembering anything or active recall IE testing yourself and spaced repetition repeating that testing of yourself over a. Of time right so I can recall about it but it's all about testing yourself you can do this another different ways you could write questions for yourself like I do for example I've got little spreadsheet where I write like loaded questions for myself that I will answer and if I don't know the answer then I'll just look it up so that saves me from having to actually write out flashcards flashcards if you want takes time but it's worth it if you can consistently maintained the splash guard have it every day or however often you want to do it everything you know about that subject methods of active recall it really doesn't matter what you do the point is you need to be testing yourself because the more you try and retrieve that Knowledge from your brain the stronger those connections are going to be encoded and therefore yeah you can understand something one day but unless you test your understanding test yourself with questions or get someone else to test you you just going to forget it cuz there's nothing cool to forget Eco the overtime you just forget everything that you've ever learned unless you actually Revisited by testing yourself so that's active recall spaced repetition is he know if you do it then you'll do it the next day and then you know wait a week and you'll have gotten some of it and then you touch yourself again and then look up the stuff you didn't know and then you already know most of it so then a month later you might test yourself and the ideas that you're interrupting the forgetting curve spaced intervals and the more you do this you offer about three or four applications of this over a. Of let's say a month or two you'll find by the end of it that you're forgetting curve is very flat and not overtime even though you're not texting yourself anymore you probably won't forget the information that's kind of the key thing to spaced repetition is to interrupt off of getting Cub so that we keep stuff in our brains for a longer. Of time so yeah that's pretty much older is to it this is a very short video is the book I'd recommend to every single student anyway because that explores all the evidence Behind These effective study techniques and Leafly going to be able to but I just wanted to make this video to address this issue of how do we learn things in the first place and the way we learn things is not by jumping straight to making a flashcard it's by understanding its by being able to explain to a five-year-old being able to explain to a friend essentially forming within our brains this mental model of a subject and getting an idea of how everything fits together in Ouran would ideally using simple language without having to rely too much on jogging so yeah I can say to him the key thing is to understand screw memorization memorization does not work consistently and over the long-term in an efficient way but if you can understand something and then use active recall and spaced repetition to bolster Foundation then you will truly understand your subject exams and end up whatever you want to do with your degree videos where I address these in-depth but yeah if you haven't seen the video and you start incorporating more testing of yourself and most spaced repetition I can pretty much guarantee that your marks will improve almost overnight so yeah see you in the next video"

Of time to be no te very pleasant experience at all you can just come on Spaceball type into the when do you start off with a space and now you can search for any file on your computer that's why I wanted to find the video of me singing the song from 2 years ago and just typing Buda and Budapest and this is why I want to open up rather than doing this whole pinched thing in front of find the app or other than on hiding the dog and kicking through the door code again would waste valuable seconds of my life every time just going out fridge so it is just like an absolutely incredible invention find all this stuff through Alfred you said this is the last 28 days since 2018 average 33.5 times a day unlike you know whenever this was about two weeks ago I was on my computer love that day I use Alfred 201 time. Save at least maybe 10 10 minutes of my life 10 minutes every day when you're on the computer basically the reason I love offred is a big part of productivity when using a machine is trying to minimize the time between you thinking that you want to do something on the computer and then nothing being done so if I think of something I want to be able to do it as quickly as possible send an email all that stuff needs to happen as efficiently as possible otherwise I'm just wasting time and Alfred is like the key duplication Jenny just you know it just makes the whole process of using this Mac just infinitely smoother and it is always be very fun I haven't still want to get a new computer component of my swipe Windows to open up Safari I can drive it and it goes over there this video I can drag it unable to do this with keyboard shortcuts and I can hit a shortcut key and I've got keyboard shortcut set up so that I can automatically can I snap Windows to their appropriate sections without really having to click anything in this particular social cut setups to have like a triple Windows setup and it's just one of the ways in which it's all about minimizing the time between thought and action I don't want to have to drag a window to the side of the screen I'll just be able to do a thing about and keyboard shortcut and it disappears and I can get on with doing the things I want to be doing all right people always ask me in YouTube comments in Instagram DMS and on the streets YG you send me no taking us what the hell is wrong with you surely you're making more for yourself but having all these note taking apps but these apps are all just a toolbox apps are not useful in regard the useful because the tools that let us accomplish something greater than that so when it comes to using a computer I consider myself a professional carpenter bees away professional Carpenter you would think why do you have 18 different screwdrivers don't you just need one screwdriver in the company would be like bro I'm a professional Carpenter each screwdriver take me instead of use is because they old Deuce of a different kind of purpose we have different apps for everything like why we looking for this one ultimate Holy Grail note taking out the does absolutely everything it's all about embracing the toolbox and so that's why I have so many new taking apps to the first one my favorite all-time I have made 5 videos about notion on my YouTube channel another like seven or eight videos about notion on workflow my series on nebula more about that in a little bit when it comes to video schedules when it comes to online classes when it comes to my website book reviews you know keeping track of the stuff that I enjoy keeping track of Liz Angus and Christian my team members can basically so much stuff in my life until I get it everyday and I write something I'm grateful for them but mostly full project management recently this is not cold room research on my friend Thomas Frank has made a lovely video about Rome again Lincoln the video description about that researches School of a note taking up but it's for research is it kind of thinking it's the app that I use for my thinking so everyday there's also two features in Rome so for example I can say time currently filming the what's on my MacBook video and now you still do I put double by brackets here and now what what has become a link has a really interesting system of kind of linking as you as your writing knows you can easily link them to other notes and ultimately what that does it gives you kind of a broad can a graph a graph overview of Olaf basically trying to replicate the way that noticed it actually organizing our brains it's not very organized in terms of notebooks and dividers and notes it's more organized into one another and so amazing so that way beyond the scope of this go in-depth into road but yeah you can find this information to his friends to get if you want to see a detailed look of how I use drum I've got like six videos available on my workflow series on nebula is a streaming platform this made by me and a bunch of other of my Creator friends and Eli post exclusive videos do you want Fun on YouTube usually that are a little bit more nutty a little bit more nice like for example in a spending an hour going over room and why I love it that's a bit too nice for YouTube for now and so I tend to post those with videos on there that are a little bit too detailed YouTube because YouTube I Like to kind of appeal to a wider audience is about 15 videos in my work for Series where I take you through my workflow for using these productivity apps and embarrassed and the easiest way to get along with a few others along with the load of other exclusive videos from other Creative Design of the Curiosity stream documentary streaming subscription platform started by John Hendricks is the founder of the Discovery Channel on curiositystream you can find documentaries cover Health business science technology history geography basically anything you can think of curiosity stream for like $3 a month or $20 a year about how are you going to do that because I'm more specifically about money you should definitely do that little details in the video description that's not moving with the video fantastic because it's there was still no app that handles everything you throw it it just as well as having it does so you know if I want to it's it's a busy like the long-term memory for my second brain so you know Equity management I use a room for like you know thinking and researching things but if there's ever anything I need to store for latest documents and images in box we have everything in it and then at some point like you know every couple of months I will just organized these into the different notebooks so these are kind of notebooks of various things I'm interested in it was nice having ever noticed this layer the long-term memory layer my second brain and freaking place on writing notes on paper my notebook quick capture note taking app can I use drops when I need to take a note of something kind of in the Moment by Connie both of the way from Ocean's Eleven on iOS ROM doesn't really have an IOS app yet Evernote is a bit slow and Bloated draft is just amazing stop into drawers from my Apple watch so for example if I'm listening to a podcast in the carnival my watch on I can just dictate some notes into it and then it'll come up and then every now and then I'll look through much broth in box and I'll check with stuff into evernote or trucks of International Trucks kind of depending on what the stuff is so dropped as my tool for quick capture it and then we have nobility which is actually the app that I use more often than the iPad because notability is the best app for Android note taking and at some I'll be doing a comparison between notability in goodnotes basically I prefer notability version but it's nice having it on my Mac just in case I need to bring up my my notes so for example often enough make notes about videos why want to do you know if I want to play North it kind of depends but this is just another part of the toolbox but this is how I deal with handwritten information because from notion and Evernote are not very good at the handwriting size thanks but that is bear and Ulysses Ulysses is is is pretty good I'd like a general writing thing and fair used to be my kind of General writing up or I will take notes on bear put dropped has soda replace the functionality of there for me and start using Road stop using you to say is because there's no an easy way to link stuff together when you to say so I'm still trying to figure out if I need these two apps and if there's a way for them to finish my workflow at the moment everyone needs to get things done and that is a to-do list manager an email client a file system on the calendar and so that's go through those into the app that I use for my to-do list is things 3 ultimately kind of keep going back to you is things 3 on things just so nice it's 8 it's one of the most beautifully designed Mac and iOS apps that I've ever used in my life these areas people about videos about hustle medicine ingestion which is kind of why I keep track of content of the music hobbies and a bucket list project throughout the day what I do is I add stuff into my inbox so forgot with hockey control spacebar I can type in you to do and then that goes into my inbox or something to do with that what I can control ships Facebook and it automatically creates a new to-do but it creates it with the context so it was messy links to the website that I was on or whatever I find in which is very hungry so remember contact eBay about doing another video that would be an easy by. Step two things and then I already think about where it goes and things you just goes in my inbox and then won today in the mornings I'll usually go through my inbox and categorize stuff into different projects do Command Ship em to the hockey hope he's already important let's put that into videos fine and let's swimming until the waste management we can move that into life OS Hustle antibiotic. This one so if I wanted music with a lot of stuff on my iPad in my life and this is how I can I keep track of my stews and the way that I do this everyday stuff that I need to do is I Marcos and that's only the stuff that I absolutely have to get done on a given day but if I finish those things than what I do is I felt this anytime list west of doesn't have a deadline because most of stuff I do doesn't buddy have a deadline to my anytime list I do more things and let go someday this with his stuff. I don't want to do in a particular week it doesn't really matter what you do decide to use as long as you have one I try not to do it over the years I've haven't really try to only focus is a bit too much I think so everyone needs an email client and one that I use is called superhuman a superhuman unfortunately is a Gmail client that cost $30 a month as long as you have some kind of doesn't matter what it is that you can easily get by but it's using Gmail in Safari or Chrome using spark mail or using Outlook I have tried like at least 10 of them so that is very nice study everyone needs a calendar in the one that I use is Fantastical or Fantastical mostly because it's got nice natural language processing and I've been using Fantastical for a few years now it is a bit expensive but hey I have no qualms of paying for apps that improve my life Alfred integration so I can write and it will automatically recognize all the different components calendar without thinking about it and of course they've gone up for iOS and iPad OS as well and even the Apple watch so it's a nice app that integrates very nicely with the Apple ecosystem and finally everyone needs some kind of cloud storage pot stores thing you're definitely living life completely wrong because you don't want to be one of those people that has everything important on your hard drive and then for some reason your computer breaks or gets stolen like basically for me my entire life is on Google Drive and do it right as way sister try folder and within Google drive but like a ton of folders and basically videos of basically like everything is organized through Google Drive when I recommend I try to Dropbox I kind of prefer Google Drive it's not nice apps that kind of works but again it doesn't socializing sweet but it's nice to be able to socialize in a productive fashion is not productive replying to messages from iPhone because I 551 my phone is just a difference between how efficient I can be with chatting to people on my phone was on my laptop so basically I want to be like most important for this is WhatsApp web if someone sends me WhatsApp message I've got like oh my group chats will my chats like it it just makes perfect sense to be able to reply to it from my Mac rather than having to reply to it from WhatsApp and it absolutely amazes me how many people don't know that this is a feature of WhatsApp like you can just will you can respond to in a given amount of time just by using Whatsapp web it seems to have iMessage or other messages I think it's called these days why I love the Apple ecosystem is because stuff like this just works so seamlessly together I think Android has been trying for the last few years to create some sort of unified messaging platform is that lets you reply to text messages from your computer but so far as far as I know it hasn't worked something has changed most of my friends use iPhone so it's so much easier for us to message each other with imessage rather than having to send an actual text or WhatsApp message so the messages is available on buddy we have slot do you slide for little thing so are you slacking to chat with my team members has Cristiano Bliss about various things and that's how we keep track of what a project groups exist but this is run by my friend Tiago Forte who runs an online course is very good by kehe everyone has money from a feedback like it's just like a bunch of cool people doing interesting things going this like SWAT team save the fields on the psychic community and then the standard which is my YouTube agency that is pretty okay YouTubers which is a bunch of other YouTubers and then there's number for I guess would be Discord I don't reuse just go to huge amount I tried setting up like a instead of server for my fence but it just had way too many people to keep up with that I found that I was never looking at the Disco just because I'm not OSU country have threaded replies it feels a no offense to anyone who use Discord but it feels like an app for kids or a slack feels like a knot for grown-ups people have grown-up chat on slack people have kitty cats on Discord and I'm not like Dakota Finance in a Ducati crate in the scene like of the bunker group description if you want to join a little bit more like those have channels Burleigh gaming in discussing General chitchat is is designed to be an app for work where is this coded is designed to be an app for gamers to just contrast kind of by that you get on these two different apps is markedly different like people take slack more seriously than the take Discord you wouldn't get people spending on slack because it's considered unprofessional you get tune people standing on Discord Anthony zoom in Skype with an optic interesting and that is the apps in my content creation machine I think that's what I told it to happen here is Final Cut Pro is the app that I use the last three years basically asked about how to edit in Final Cut these days I don't need anymore but I will still dabble with Final Cut Instagram so I got the earlier today when I was procrastinating from filming this video I picked up the guitar and I feel myself singing American Pie by Don McLean and editing as part of the machine we have logic proten I use loaded for two things firstly and most importantly it's editing my weekly podcast me and my brother if you did not have a weekly podcast. thinking you can fight it all sounds a bit too kind of dabbling with logic in terms of arranging covers of popular songs which is something to record the screen screenflex told my screen cost at tutorials and things Mills Ave e, which is my new favorite app for live streaming so I've got a few different screen setup and things like Skype automatically connect with e, so for example everything to the livestream with no taken from okay joke. and that worked out very nicely because ecam is just so beautiful T's on a Mac and finally I subscribe to the Adobe Creative Cloud the whole package the ones that I used most often do people Edition I use that to extend soundtracks for Roseanne's to do audio editing a little bit I dabble with Photoshop and illustrator and Photoshop a lot more back in the day when I was super into web design and graphic design but even so it's still nice to have Photoshop and illustrator to be able to quickly project or just put some ideas on to some kind of graphic design package before if you want to hear more details about how use room how he's notion how he's into paper and a few different aspects my workflow not available koobideh curiositystream file Lincoln video description more details that if you like this video you might also like to check out my video and what types of go on my iPad use a lot of the same apps on my Mac as a my iPad and in that video I took about five different categories of apps how about fits into my life thank you very much"

that you can use to massage yourself so you like it like this and then you can find the spots that really hurts and so I have this these except old-time swing around we go to these two utility cupboards which awesome of my favorite parts of the house this is the cupboard essentially what we've got here is Storage storage space laptop Wi-Fi router stuff is basically this laptop is for connecting via a wired connection so that I can upload files to my editor via Google Drive during this one and then we have storage cupboard number to oversee the light switch this is where we stockpile toilet paper when locked on get announced it's good to buy these things in bulk moving on let's start off in my bedroom so I have the smallest bedroom in the two-bedroom house of course because I'm such a gentleman and this is basically the box-room sir this here is the Ikea elvarli shelving units type thing we've a few storage boxes here for random stuff we go to microphone Garrison folders a few bucks is this is my collection of fragrances My Friends School of sense of humor Grande fragrance YouTube channel Link in the video description various deodorants moisturizers the whole shebang and we have the newly-appointed 1 million subscribers plaque asleep to every night when I feel lonely I'm like well at least I'm going to begin subscribers that's boost my self-esteem then moving on here we have some drawers going one is for my t-shirts that used to be in tardigrade but now I've decided that I'm going to Branch out and I don't have very we have my underwear and sock drawer the only underwear for the record I use is the Uniqlo airism underwear it's like literally the best one so I have like 30 copies of that and then we have just a moment draws more drawers sportsstuff and if you hung us this was when I used to work full-time as a doctor I would have to wear shorts to work this is basically all of the clothing that I own so I told basically in one place on here we have the bookshelf recently installed where I have physical copies of books I read Kindle anyway but if a book looks pretty or if I want to show it often and videos and stuff then I will buy the physical book and shove it onto the bookshelf is a Christmas card from extended my YouTube agency was a little Christmas tree and the standards plus nebula more on that in a little bit but my Oxford Handbook of clinical medicine Oxford Handbook of the foundation programme I look at this before going to bed early tonight because it reminds me that I'm a doctor and that makes me feel good when I'm also feeling the next we come to the bed small double beds with these Linens thing is on it and it's a bad nothing special about it don't take a comfortable by guess who gets the job done that's not table next to it that often has my blue light blocking glasses thingies which at night time I clip onto my I'm really cool and then that means I can block out blue light for my face which apparently helps me to sleep at night because I wasn't able to have an analog clock next to my best because I don't believe in taking my son to bed with me so when I wake up in the middle of the night we have my Kindle Oasis of course we have these two books this isn't my journal or something's right and this is a little happier by Derren Brown Dyson fan this is really cool I feel like a little remote control for it and it's just like a reasonably aesthetic fan which I have on every night just it's pretty solid Harry Potter poster we built some Game of Thrones posters from this sites who do the intellitouch posters and another Game of Thrones won over there and I'm thinking I might install some more shelves and maybe a wall mounted guitar along this wall but that's essentially for of my bedroom that's not where the hallway bathroom main bathroom come on in nothing interesting here I probably should have cleaned up a little bit before this video but I didn't want to create an impression actually I am season my smart scales wet every morning just before having a shower when I make it I will weigh myself and then I can see a graph of my weight and I saw the other day that I put on about 6 in the last 3 months thanks look down I was hoping that would be like mostly muscle but unfortunately the batteries don't come out the bathroom face towels I started using recently cuz I've heard that you're not supposed to wipe your face with the same towel that used to watch the rest of your body which was a recent addition to my life Ice Palace moisturizer professional limescale remover this thing is great running deodorant toothbrush my Invisalign in have a notebook which of the parent able to prove so that if I get ideas in the shower I can like I use this one and I don't think it's quite as waterproof as it was pretty good waterproof notebook I want to test that ever again of the ball three next even had the big room much to the Chagrin of my grandma is always like why did you give the girls a big room like this either go anyway this is his room this is the the hog disco chair or something the desk this is a nice desk from John Lewis MacBook Soledad set up one of these like typewriter keyboard in the video description if you want to check it out very pink in the candle and pink and pink and pink and pink yeah that's fine we have the Best Way Taxi has a single mattress on as of this is a double bed but we were feeling a bit cheap Kunis so we didn't buy double mattress we have a single mattress pad from home so there is this loss of on the side and then the rest of your suitcases and stuff and over here we have a built-in wardrobe E-Type thing which one do I have in it is it a few more clothing to me Tuxedo in random places and this stupid leather jacket that I stupidly got tailored in Vietnam when I went there in 2017 thinking I was going to be the sort of guy in fact I'm going to right now what do you think of my custom made leather jacket from Hawaiian in Vietnam I just look really cool what you reckon it's alright I like to think it's a muscle. master bedroom also has an ensuite moving on we now come to the kitchen reasonably spacious pizza from last night some cookies from before sweet popcorn hot dog buns will drinking homemade hot dogs the other days last one for the cost on teapot so thank you Mom you were right expects Oates this is so this is like a temperature controlled coffee pouring tot casserole with kind of coffee apparatus where I will use the Chemex use a filter and use the kettle to make coffee every morning phone over that song over the sink microwave NutriBullet that I used to use occasionally cuz I'm going to do some movies and stuff and be so this is the Dyson V8 animal something coming something Wireless Hoover which is otherwise known as the spider this is the pull-up bar have the whole working from home lockdown vibe when I walk through the kitchen but makes my body hot so I've tried to do it very often finally let's move on to the living room welcome his the pride and joy of the house this is the studio this is why everything is filmed let's talk let's talk over here and walk away down this is the LG 55in GX TV or something like that swear I watch stuff on nebula and curiositystream more on that in a little bit Apple TV 4K that's connected to it I think we've done a very good job of cable management because it's just this little white thing that handles all of the cables and otherwise it's also fairly invisible they built these on this Random TV stand it has my breath I should have done nothing but we did this anyway this is the PlayStation 4 which will be replaced by the PlayStation 5 controller this is the Anthem minipro which I was intending to use for streaming at some point when I become a pro streamer mobile games has Boston Lord of the Rings this exit Game pandemic One Night Ultimate Werewolf codenames fun Obby and we've got random bits in the cupboard this is sort of us not, it's okay and we have snacks in there but not right now next I will show you the balcony there is a bit less Grim I sit down and have a coffee and do some like typing on the iPad out here and it feels right accidentally put some Tiki fake plants over there that don't need well-trained because now we have this are the living rooms at plant one pump to pump three random books of it that it probably should be there I should still goes out this is like a old man Chad things agrees Mountain unemployed men making videos on the internet now we have the Apple TV remote we have the actual TV remote we have a lamp have a radiator can we have this Game of Thrones the road thing that my cousins right kind of gave me and said that's nice. if I am watching something on the Apple TV moving on next we have the sofa this is like the cheapest so far that you can get from Ikea and it's very uncomfortable but it's fine. cushions cushions Jean-Louis range I think they look quite nice in the background and up here we have three posters from disk lights these are metallic but they're going matte finish on them so hopefully they don't reflect lights from like the studio license. Very much South Africa which is where I used to live for about five years it was actually a country which is surrounded by they don't have elicited posters do I have to pick South Africa and we have London which is where I spent a summer in my second year of med school doing a research project is fun and over here we have this took two tables which is pretty ideal because we often use them as like the place to either pay board games or die to have dinner will be done using proper dining table this eat pizza or whatever off of this table Run Names for the Palms by the way so we've got run over here with Jenny over here we have Neville of hair he's a little one and we're going to dinner over here you can see a naming convention money onto my wallet at Medical Luna so I like naming naming stuff around the house cuz it makes me feel good we have men Guitar Festival in 2016 or something like that since we have the bookshelf which is a spider plant over there this one doesn't yet have a name with the name that's cool that Draco I'll take it out of time Apple homepod Books graduation teddy bear again remind myself that I actually went to University but got some Anatomy flashcards to look pretty because I've never once opens them in my life we have the Throne of Glass series over here which looks by knife in book format books books books board games friends house and some piano books and this is a little tripod that I use for my phone when I'm feeling myself singing a song your phone attached to it Pakistani tourist I can like run around with my selfie stick like this but mostly I use a tripod for the phone have the guitar a Martin mini I think it's similar to the one that apparently Ed Sheeran uses Claudia Out Of Tune but it's also electro-acoustic which means in theory I can go busking with it and connected to an amplifier which of the plan at some point is one of those drums. Acoustic musicians sometimes use to play one of these I kind of play it like you know when you're in school and you're sitting on a table and you can like anything like it beats on the table I kind of tree pecan like that as well so I can go there I just sounds kind of cool when friends are over on her having little jam session so this also doubles as a seat if we run out of seating if we have friends over there is no going on next we have a piano keyboard Yamaha p125 adhere that remind me to practice things I'm practicing so that's like supposed to feel your abdominal muscles in your core testing final and some of the songs from the greatest showman and how to teach myself how to read music so I'm not going to say anything but normally this is like my job I'm also having kind of lessons these days to get a little bit better at playing the piano and then behind here we have basically nothing going on. Finally we come to the desk now this is going to do it it's usually in sitting form this is the Herman Miller sayl chair which is my favorite organic shareable time it's really nice and I've set it up so that it is kind of the perfect height to me again on McCallie the guy from Herman Miller came over when delivering the chair and gave me some tips on how to set up an Alexa which is why my desk is lower than I thought it would be this is like a protest I'm going to make a video about in a bit here we have the LG 49 inch ultrawide monitor sent me over a year ago and have been using it since then we have VIP units at 96 keyboard magic Trackpad Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse will run by the 2018 15 inch MacBook Pro which I'm going to very shortly replace would like a Mac Mini and go to Blackmagic egpu and a Post-It note saying I hate you from my house made with rhinos with her stuff going on in 7B microphone which I use my zoom cool dance to my online courses we have one random have the focusrite to I-4 Scarlett audio interface we have a cloudlifter thing we have a client here just want to put Harry is the PS3 resistance on the phone front and it sort of overhang the desk so I can feel like I'm in the midst of check while I'm otherwise just sitting on the computer doing absolutely nothing we have my hundred thousand subscribers than the gold finish on the 1 million subscriber plaque which is why is here we have a long crack and then all the way of the world nothing and I haven't thought about fixing it yet speaker over that lamp over there to do overhead videos related to Tech and we have this which means I can turn it on with one of these remote controllers and this is Diego ducks sl60 with the aperture space light extension which means that if I'm feeling a video at my desk it's just take a single tap to turn the light on and then not looking pretty sick most of the stuff estate fairly constant over the last year or so for the one thing that has changed is that very recently we go distv which I made a little blog about and this is now my favorite place to hang out in the evenings usually watching stuff on the nebula app on the Apple TV nebula is amazing streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of other creators and I host a lot of educational extra content to put firstly on nebula cut my own videos with the app free no deposit bonus content which is basically I take you through a deep dive into my top favorite productivity apps and how we use them Wheels to have a deep dive Snippets Series where I take hold of the Deep dive long-ass interviews that I've done with lot of people over the internet and we chop them up into bite-sized chunks that you can watch content from a load of places that you might be familiar with including Thomas Franklin TN Wendover Productions and Tom Scott not the best way to access nebula is by signing up to a subscription for curiositystream documentary streaming founded by John Hendricks the founder of the Discovery Channel and on curiositystream you'll find hundreds of really high-quality high-budget documentaries and because your ass is three more big fan of supporting independent educational craters Google is amazing bundle with curiositystream and that means it is wanted for curiositystream Which is less than $15 a year you also get free access to nebula bundled with that serve less than $15 a year you getting access 202 getting all of my exclusive content and exclusive content from education crisis over nebula would make this in my opinion the single best deal in the streaming well if that's the head of a picture of a stream.com or hit the link in the description and that will give you your account email Logan details from me at 11 o and the lights in the living room off Philips Hue and two right now we go to Minnesota relax mode Alexa turn on energize in the living room and then the lights will become as blue thing that makes you feel good I could say Alexa turn on concentrate in the living room and then they go little bit more yellow or my favorite ice and fire in the living room another kind of blue and orange and this is the kind of vibe that I go when I'm filming videos so I have like a blue glow in the corner of the desk and then on this other side I've got an orange glow over there so this was a tour of my apartment I'm going to do another separate video about my desk setup which is going to be linked to over there if it's not there already so much watching and see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need any money with Ali and the final year medical student at Cambridge University and in this video I'm going to be briefly explaining how the UK medical training system works Beyond medical school and at the end of the video I'll give you a quick update as to where I'm currently fitting into this grand scheme of as usual everything's time to come down below in the description so you can skip ahead to the right to feel like it but yeah let them into it with me about how you can medical training looks so as Medical School lost is required to do an intercalated degree like Cambridge and its optional so in those places medical school or 624 give or take a few years. you're registered etcetera etcetera Medical School you join the Foundation program at every single medical graduate does the Foundation program on the fundation program lost two years ago the fy1 and FYI to three different a full monty Chinese rotations might be for example general surgery Journal medicine Psychiatry and then fy2 you might have OMG is I'm a fool you might have a cardiologist number 5 Andres. That's what I think it is like that's when you make the choice I'm simplifying a little bit but I'll give you a medical training and cool surgical training now off to doing two years of cool medical training Betsy want to become a cardiologist Cardiology the medical specialty you would apply for st3 Cardiology specialist training 3 in cardiology music for surgical training then apply to sd3 in Plastics specialist training 3 in plastic guns at 3 because you've done two years of surgery training already so this is your third year of Medical Training 60 is what happened off 288 that is when you become a consultant effectively so around the age of 24 you make the choice at around age 26 you're cool medical training and for surgical training last two years that takes you up to age 28 and then from SD SDA 260x about takes roughly about the age 34 to 35 which is pretty much the earliest time you can be a consultant in the UK so that's how it works the basic cool medical and cool surgical Specialties but what if you want to become a GP or what if you want show me talk about run through Specialties with run through Specialties everyone still does medical school everyone still does fy19 fy2 it's just a 413 Specialties you have a few more options when it comes to the choice as we discussed you need to go down the CMT to CST can go for a run through specialty which starts off as st12 specialty training one from SD 128 and then you have sd2 and then you have st3 and then you are a fully-fledged GP pretty much so it's taking you three years beyond the choice to three years after Foundation years to become a GP therefore in total it takes you 5 years after graduating medical school about the age 2938 to become a fully-fledged Hilton Garden goes all the way up to 87 on the cool medical-surgical because you're instead focusing on the specialty from the moment you finish Foundation is so sd132 and Elizabeth Specialties like Psychiatry Pediatrics neurosurgery of the others Ophthalmology I think and I'll put it into the VMAs medical training pathway in the description below if you're interested but to be honest this should hopefully give you a fatty brought over yesterday there you go off to medical school so two years of foundation training probably 2 years of core training like for medical-surgical and then probably five or so years five six years of specialty training otherwise you might do a run-through program in general the earliest you can become a consultant in a in a the age of 34 35 X 35 I'm not something that I'm positive at the moment basically for the foundation programme the whole of the UK Scotland Wales and England that's hard to hold of the UK's to look into various different regions Olde Scotland is pretty much one region thank them all in order of preference to I've ranked East Anglia as my highest preference with a sangria in food Cambridge and Avila Cambridge and include some of the smaller hospitals around Cambridge Bedford England that we've been at Cambridge students do you want to go for London London lifted up into three regions number one is North West London at the moment number to his Northeast Central Ave 3 South times which covers a broad area including like Brighton in Canton like a load of other places to buy you drank your regions in order of preference and you get matched make it a region based on your F Pascal Your Foundation program application score I think score and your school determines which region you end up in Northwest London and Northeast Central London are two of the most competitive so you need a higher score to get into London competitive there other areas like Yorkshire and Trenton someone they're not that competitive so you need to lower after school to get into those not once you've been matched to a particular region then at that point you have to rank order pretty much all of the various jobs in that region so jump number one might say fy14 Nation you one rotation of A1A an irritation of a tube general surgery rotation medicine 6 rotations on the order in which they then which they come and the hospital in which will be based so for example in might say that for job number one out of five 500 so you have to look at this usually loads and you rank them in order of preference and then those jobs are allocated in order of this again the day after Foundation programs do they have passed score average person that relatively High School relative to the sangria therefore it's it's it's nowhere near the high school so I'm unlikely to get my very first choice of job but I think I'm probably pretty likely to get at least we know something in my top five maybe my top 10 to each you usually buy around the first week of March he find out which specific region you're going to end up in and then you have about a month to rank order all the jobs and then bye bye April time you'll be you'll know which hospital in particular you're going to be in which rotation in particular so that's where we're at the moment we're in between March and April so I know that I'm going to be which was my first choice Club Cambridge kind of the job so I can you know which ones I want understandable overview of how medical training in the UK I applied for but I didn't actually get on this going to be more on this in my video coming up at some point about how to deal with rejection the academic Foundation program runs alongside the foundation programme the AFP for shorts fy13 fy13 an FYI to the academic program is pretty much the same to do Foundation you one Foundation you to accept usually one of your rotations usually something an FYI to is it like a is a research block from some sort the sort of research you would like to do and then you have an application for me to have an interview and kind of the scores from that decide which order preferences allocated into I applied to the any programs there cuz when you're applying for AFP the regions of slightly different so for example London Lisa to 1 Biggs and rather than three different earrings feedback that you were appointed bill but other people scored higher than you said they were given their preferences first and then I wasn't given anything because I didn't try hard enough at the end to be so that was a bit of a blow I would have quite like to do the academic Foundation programme it is what it is Foundation program in Cambridge gateway drugs to get you into some kind of research some kind of academic career there is this thing pulled the academic clinical fellowship program if you worrying about like stuff like the academic medical fellowship program which comes like eight years down the line then useful to have some kind of academic stuff on Jingle Bells the academic Foundation program is the first way into that I will at least have some research experience under my belt that I can get through the Noble Foundation programme I want to have a specific form unblocking which to do research but I'm hoping it to get involved with projects and things so I have absolutely no idea how long this video has been but to summarize you have six years of they have two years like I always have two years of the Foundation program or the academic Foundation program officer that you make the choice and the choice is between cool medical training which is two years will surgical training or just 2 years or a run-through specialty like GP or Psychiatry or up to 90 never which have their own good number of years and usually a few things especially training you're a consultant and that's usually about the age of 35 36 if you've done everything on time if you don't take any time out so that's pretty much how it works have you found this video matched to East Anglia animal the process of writing my jobs and I'll do another video explaining what happens once I find out whether we're we're going to be for the next as well as send videos for medical students videos about what's games and videos about me out of this other sorts of stuff"

Partly makes it easier to see stuff so it's on box it and then I'll start using this from now on because this will make me better daughter the sound travels through something to do with headaches from chrome thing is that's very cool okay wonderful what else PennDOT the torch it's a pain that's a torch as well with medisave branding on it thanks God for sending this to me for free again very kind of you all right time to see how this thing actually works they sent me this case for it I suppose this fits somehow fits in here let's play the song and see if it's any good so I'm going to listen in the aortic region first good heart sounds wanted to present no out of towns no moma's this is a good sign pulmonary region tricuspid valve region actual region I don't have anything wrong with my thoughts I just compared to this one because I want to hear stuff I have two cats that sit there for ages being like is that really what I heard is that ready to head but I think this will make it easier to hear stuff let's listen to breath sounds now so that's good African hair as well is an expensive Cardiology stethoscope for cardiology consultants this is the standard stethoscope that all medical students and Junior doctors use the review of a stethoscope I mean a bit faster it comes in nice colors you can customize the finish on the The Bell the event I-24 the shiny finish. Do it look cool never to go to the black as well we have here is a little bit heavier than this one I imagine that this would hurt your shoulders after a while if you see if you're not used to it but I guess it didn't make this a little bit more hinge which is always good but yeah to the Cardiology for probably not I mean I know some Consultants you still use their original cult classic II stethoscope sodium original stethoscope because of that theory is that if you can't hear it with a normal stethoscope then it doesn't matter enough for you to Wireless Bose A cardiology consultant who's more about having a fancy stethoscope but then having said that if you think someone does have ammonia one situation where I can see this being useful is I've been on the elderly medicine water last two months or so and I found that often the Consultants will listen to the patients through the clothing like rather than doing the whole fat getting them to I think full cases where patients have difficulty sitting forward difficulty in like they can save you quite a bit of time when you when you just kind of listen through the clothes and you can say you have the chest sounds clear for patient whose you know to be contact still be useful to have the thing that lets you hear stuff more loudly cuz then you can listen to clothing rather than having to undress the patient but I don't receive any benefits of upgrading butthead what do make me about a doctor probably not but I need all the help I can get Technology reviews and protiviti and studying education and stuff"

Arnie's Monday single as I found out are you supposed to have a listing for a video about the power of protected preparing for a physiology teaching session that I'll be doing a resume my first-year medical students who have their exams coming up isn't that fun after half an hour though I find myself losing concentration so I head over to Tangles bedroom for off of dosing for a bit at 2:15 I still think a waistband and warm some leftover Biryani for lunch eat while watching season 10 of Modern Family then at 3 p.m. I decide to continue a bust of productivity and a drive over to the service station to charge the car I plug it in even though the respect to the other Tesla drivers near me and grab a latte from Starbucks I intend to get some work but instead I end up spending 20 minutes browsing Tesla accessories how many faces charging in about 30 minutes so I had back home before it starts to charge me for idle time and supercharger Rodger the charging door of the car open I plugged it in then have to pay any payment and I don't know how it's going to charge me but it just works really well and within about half an hour at went from 38% all the way up I could have charged it longer if I wanted to but they recommend kind of 80% unless you're going on a long journey because the final 20% takes a bit longer on the parent if you charge it all the way too much nuts ruins the quality of the battery or something like that Whitmore there are so many moments where I thought damn this thing is really nice it was mostly when accelerating because when you're on the motorway for example traveling at 70 miles per hour it doesn't really feel much different to do macaw butts in the kind of day today Town driving where there's a Gap Road in front of me and I cannot accelerate that's what I feel like yeah I've got the power and sick very quiet again if you still get the sound from the outside stuck in the sound of the wheels it still feels quieter than my normal car but you really get a sense of the quietness when you're driving so late so for example coming into the Gated area right now I almost couldn't hear the car it's all whereas with a normal car I would have heard a big from of the so I suppose the slower you drive the more you appreciate the silent features of the car that's her halfway through day 1 of driving at the moment I'm thinking this was totally worth it kind of cool so we'll see how it goes for the 4:30 p.m. and do another burst of what from 5 p.m. I join a mental session for the building a second brain online course that I'm a mentor and a chat to some of the other students in breakout rooms to discuss what we're aiming to get out of a second brains and then at 5:30 I do a zoom interview with Dan from the super organizers Niza why we talked in depth about my notion setup and the behind-the-scenes of my personal productivity for whatever that's worth at 6:40 I get back on the computer this time to plant some of the Tesla videos and detail writing scripts for more upcoming videos and then at 7 p.m. I decide that I might as well head to the gym to brush out a quick Sash and try to bring my dream of becoming a gymshark athlete One Step Closer I Get to the gym around 7:30 p.m. and then I spent 40 minutes there do exercises because I'm way too cool top in the audiobook for Cricket Kingdom by pick up some grilled chicken takeaway we got home around 9:30 when we Munch want to take away while watching two episodes of Modern Family and then before calling it a night and I practice the harmonies of the song Something Stupid by Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman today's day in the life look to close thank you for watching D please hit this playlist for more videos in the series and hopefully I'll see you in the next video goodnight and afterwards we drop into okay"

            "text": " hello and welcome back to the beam at tip series my name is LL be your host for this episode and today we're going to be talking about section 2 months and I'm going to be giving you some top tips on how to do well in it I am recording this and who Chi Minh City Airport we've got about an hour left until I fly so I thought I'd do the totally normal thing and bust out the camera and record a video about the bema anyway let's just jump right into it there are three important tips that were going to be going over today number one fractions there is a mantra that we teach on automobile crash courses and we've been for the last five years and fractions are our friends we say this because fracture , pretty much throughout the whole team up paper Section 1 problem solving angles fractions section 2 chemistry and inspection section 2 physics and section 2 math olinville fractions in fact fraction Section 3 which is the right until copiously is a really good way of boosting your being at school in fact it is only one thing you do between now and the beam improving your actions is probably going to give you the biggest increase in Pima School you need to be able to add subtract multiply divide and simplify fractions by easily and quickly and secondly you need to be able to convert percentages and decimals into fractions because numbers are far easier to work with when they're in fraction form then when the rain percent to decimal form usually in fact we recommend doing any kind of question if you ever see a number in potential decimal form just converted to a fraction Speedway because chances are you'll need it in fraction form to be able to work with a tight run over say this is when within reason if you seen 0.28 + 2 * 122 converted into a fraction fractions fractions fractions is going to boost a vehicle that section 1 Section 2 chemistry section 2 physics and section 2 months old involved in some sort usually that requires you to do some kind of thing with fractions and being good at mental maths will just be that up so actually do points please please please no u-turn 12 Inside Out you shouldn't be having to think when else do you know if a question requires you to work out seven times eight or like nine times six. Unfortunately the people who are the best time to do very well as well because you just say so much time if you can quickly do you know a lot of calculators so you have to do everything in your head and they're almost new questions and female that require you to do like a long division oil like long multiplication of things like that it's all short Snappy thumbs plus minus x divided that you can I'll actually a website, which was made by my brother and in that you just take 30 second to just use Mental Math some Saturdays you can and it gives you leaderboard it's kind of like that Braintree Nintendo DS program. We used to play back in the day I don't know if you guys still play that thing with was still around but when I was in school anyway yeah The Way Forward three please don't be afraid to get an ulcer and move on and this applies very much section 2 questions of pretty hard and ordinarily you wouldn't be able to do them in under 1 minute they're going to be about 7 section 2 math questions and maybe three or four of them are going to be not doable in 1 minute if you're a normal person so quickly on I'm just guessing also and we've owned the not worth your time in fact what we've seen quite a few times through the years is that we got some students are amazing amount to 400% that's one thing they still got a low section to Mark and I think one of the reason for that is that when it comes to math questions they get this kind of thing in their head that right this is a math question I know it's a standard I'm going to get this question right and then it's been 3 minutes of the question that's not the way forward please recognize the hard math questions and don't even attempt to them if you can keep under the mat laundromat I just guessing I was going to leave until the end because I know that would be very good at taking my head. So the thing I would just leave it till the end come back to it if we have fun in the end taking you over minute to answer any questions I can ask questions just guessing on Sir move on time and even better take you a long time don't even bother attempting it just gets announcer at the end of time so it's for how to do a friend which applies to the rest of the team as well number to please get good at Mental Math which applies to three please don't be afraid to leave a question and move on which actually also applies to the hobbema but is especially true of the math questions cuz those are the ones that people for some reason don't seem to want to skip Note 5 show wife is that none of the three top tips or anything to do with content really there more about like mint amassing skills with fractions and things let's talk about practice if you want the other videos you know I keep talkin about practice and I keep on saying that the best way to do well in Section 1 and section to assist you lost another practice questions this is kind of true for section 2 months as well and I say kind of because as useful the question that use it quite novel every year and it takes a bit of intuition a bit of mathematical reasoning to get the answer so the question is what was it doing the district on condition and even more importantly making sure you know where you went wrong for questions you got wrong so that you can develop intuition you can develop the skills and if that question type comes up again then you'll be you'll be able to know what's going on which I plug in every single one of these videos with his amazing for this one being not enjoy the rock 2003b no questions of which a few hundred a month questions that you can just do completely free of charge and if you're serious about to be Matt this is pretty much a no-brainer we go all of the peanut questions from the law 15 years with papers and then some that we were in all cells that you can do completely free of charge so you might as well if you do get stuff from we will to go to work solutions to every single question in the questions that were written by Oakridge medical students to try to explain the reason behind it and explain how for access to these work Solutions party because we have to pay thousands of pounds to get the Oak Bridge medical students actually brought them in the first place you left me to send an email and we will give you whatever discount you want off the solutions are off anything on the website so I mean if you can afford it isn't much we talked about three types of email those were number one fractions reference number to please let's learn or mental math and timetables and .223 let's not be afraid to guess and move on because I'm a specific white hard and finally you might as well be available for free at pretty much a no-brainer if you want you can get you can pay for artistic Solutions or you can just come over here if you're having difficulty with something and I will get back to you with work solution as soon as I can I recommend you check them out they're pretty reasonable and I'll get some pretty reasonable advice in the next few videos will be talkin about section three and then after that we might do a deeper dive into some of the section 1 Section 2 topic questions about the beam at or about anything. please let me know and I will definitely get back to you. Maybe we'll come in on these videos of the moment so like everything I will take into account"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you're new here my name is already on the final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is a series of videos where I've interviewed lots of my medical student friends and ask them for advice about the medicine application we done videos already on the personal statement and applying to Oxbridge how is about interviews and how you can prepare for them I'm going to be hearing from 10 different medical students about giving 15 tips on how to prepare for your medicine interviews on this applies whether you've got a normal interview or an MRI or multiple mini interview if you look in the description that you'll find timestamp to all the different types so if you had something before or if you want to revisit something again then you can just click on the appropriate time stamp and it'll take you to the right place in the video I'm not sure if this works no balls but hey list all 15 tips and I'll see you at the end for the classic please like comment subscribe at this point if you'd like to subscribe to see more videos like this please do certain subscriber but now before my interviews I was pretty scared adecuado preparation for them each one of them I write down all the different things I can think of that they might ask going to really iron what was I was going to take for my cousin statement what it was I was going to try and sell to them and not Monument an education shortlisted to express to always talk about so incredibly enough titties I ever had it know what I want to say about you should go close going to give that was very conscious that I didn't want to come across with us so whenever I went through in my head through my experiences I've never like really write anything down and I don't even a bullet point I bet it would say call Kristin Holmes Beach Music at my mind so I drove all night and then talk around it because a lot more fluid the questions that I thought would probably come up so that's why you want to do this medical school which is experience and I just bought a pointed ounces I didn't write out bursitis that I think I did send the things I was very much against trying to write paragraphs on since to the danger that is you and the memorizing paragraph and then you stressed out not just comes across really badly in the interview of like the main ideas not like this specific decor ideas whatever you're in Alexa and someone you can always tell when someone's reading the slides on goes to add living a bit their style changes the way they talk changes invariably there more engaging be that second person to be reading something office light in your head but you can get practice trying to be spontaneous by getting loads of people to interview you and get them to give you your arms and get your friends to sit down with you and you know what they usually fun things to do and as quietly as you never know what questions are going to come up please answer any questions including those people to give me interview questions so I found like a list of interview questions online I got 100 interview questions books and just kind of gave it to a friend's friend's family my mom my brother and my my friends my teachers and just said right can we have fun just you know talk to me as if this would wear this for an interview and I actively out for a lot of critical feedback and I found that really helpful so I mean like every every single time people told me that I spoke too fast so I mean I still do to this day but that reminder posted like post-interview X made me think that okay I need to kind of slowed down a bit to me talking to so deep it's probably about the right speed like I feel I'm talking to slowly right now but for you it's probably the right speed where is normally you're in if you wants it so just just just like getting sister sitting in front of you given the questions you wanted to ask you and then just when you're replying with your answers try to get them to come in on maybe your mannerisms the way you look when you're talkin where you're looking while you're soaking your body language and excetera primary I think when it comes to preparing for interviews your key thing is make sure that you're comfortable and confident you can go over as many questions as you want but particularly when you're applying to Cambridge or Oxford they been authorized Apple's of you in any way to prepare for that support yourself in a mindset way you can think through what they said and reply back and I can size and completed Monett they even if you haven't heard of something before even if you don't really sure what the answer if you feel confident enough selfie can sit and think things through. Let me be a primary asset so when it came to Preparing I just as many processing fees as I could I would let you sit down with as many teachers of a kid in my parents and just a story mindset where I can think things through and give you some sort of on-site even if it is probably rubbish as well as my primary way of preparing just practicing and making sure that I was confident stop music consultant he's quite often used to interviewing applicants so depending on the California to teach this being that will the bathtub but for the clinical ones if you know any doctors just asked questions about professionalism students left. Is anybody questions on the pressure and to get you used to actually speaking and thinking probably just thinking what I would say it is already important skill you have to prepare in a way that fit you so rather than just sweating off when all the common questions that get Austin what some of the questions on Tuesday to give up which is obviously important you have to do all the other so you need to have a really good think about what your weakness is always comes to interview all you to unload Only Argan side little bit relaxed and you might say something that comes across as when to flip it over to argant like that jeep has any deal with coughs and colds or are you the other side of the spectrum and you really get very anxious when you're in an interview situation in which case you need to find with chocolate cake make your life harder than one is what it's going to be so just find ways from parents friends who you don't know very well even if it's just really basic questions like why do you want to study medicine they don't need to be a medic that can help you replicate this stressful scenario fooling someone you don't know very well I just full size you to what food that stress and put them on deguerin just talk about your answers on this day and enthusiastic see I was one thing that really helped me this whole getting people to ask me to be questions and then getting them to give me constructive critical feedback and I think that's one thing that people do find quite difficult because it is really hard to take criticism well you kind of want to defend oh I did I was talking like that because of this answer this question because of that but I say when preparing for interviews and indeed for the rest of life it's it's quite useful to leave your ego at the door there is no need for you to get defensive if you do get critical feedback just put it all together and then take the bits of it that you think that you can feed to be work on and you will improve find out about where you're applying to so if it when I applied to Birmingham did a quick Google search for fun things to do in Birmingham just so I knew there was something to talk about so I knew that they were there was a mini golf place in summer in Star City well I it supposed to keep up with the news and with current events in health and science so I'mma buy read BBC Health everyday just donuts on my train ride to school so just doing Simple Things I got that keeps you in the know stuff to talk about things that you don't have to talk about this or this date this thing just happened recent student band Jane I could find I'm just trying to be aware of some of the biggest news house news it was happening at the time and then I'm right off of my in at one of my subjects just made sure that I was okay with the one if they still text and we're ready to serve defend them in until 5:11 and use them in an interview situation before you go into interview generally you can have things go to thoughts go to positive thoughts about things you've done in the past all the times when you've been stressed out but turned out really well and it's been well thought stress and people believe in you and positive things they said about you order those can be really good fuel the psyching yourself up when you're feeling you know worried about what will he into interview delivery remember that your communication how you how you interact with patient so with them you want to let them see who you really are and people see that you're genuine answers rather than us script make sure you always working interview in as honest and genuine away as you can don't talk in a very incredibly ridiculous and quite eccentric what away because you're trying to give off the impression an incredibly intelligent person it will just come across and Stephen a bit weird so just trying to go self trying to look genuinely and everything the enthusiastic and I have confidence in yourself have confidence in your interview abilities and desire to do meds and that you'll be able to spontaneously answer some questions as well cuz I didn't want it clocks in New Mexico. The more you try and think of answers to the questions in advance then will you be soon by them when they are not what you expected it to be you going to preach at 2 we need to chat watching a hippie find that useful that was 15 tips from 10 different medical students on how you can prepare for your interviews if you like the video please hit the thumbs up button down below it really helps if you like see more videos like this you can hit the Subscribe button identities I like how to answer common questions how to deal with awkward interviews that sort of thing and I will to do vlogs every now and then about life as a medical student so you might you might like to subscribe all the best video interviews are freaking cookie smash it and I will see you in the next one good night"

Whatsit face has a small bowel obstruction that give us some gas which is like an oral contrast agent that helps the bowels get Movin do that more and then we'll do an x-ray 6 hours after that to see if the bowel obstruction is resolved or so after about half-an-hour running for the patients and getting through what's wrong with them then spit up and usually one of the Juniors goes consultants and we see how the patients and then the other Junior goes with the other consultancies the other half the patients and then when we see the patient about getting the notes up on the system is quite handy cuz I was the iPad with me so I can just plug into a computer system there and then and we can therefore safe time or don't have to wait to grab one of those me no computer on Wheels and log into the system and wait for it to load in the laptop that's quite hungry on the iPad seeing the patients were doing things like checking their Vital Signs so you know overnight that they spot the temperature did the heart rate go dangerously low anything like that we're looking at a blunt most patients away looking after I have blood test on a fairly regular basis often daily so we look at that Bloods and make sure there's nothing disastrously wrong with them and ask them how the feeling if there's any pain that's all the stuff and we're trying to move them along the journey and try and discharge them in a safe fashion can we see patients we would then generate some jobs so for example if a patient was complaining of continuing abdominal pain and the consultant examine them and think okay I'm not happy with this damn I'd say okay let's get a CT scan for this patient because we're clearing adenoma appendicitis or something and then I would I've had CT scan for the patient and I do to put it in patient notes electronically but it's useful to have these two companies because you don't want to then have to log into every single patient notes to get a list of your jobs so you put the jobs list on the patient's notes but then you also have your own separate which I use the Apple goodnotes full these days anyway we do the world round we were in the hospital in this usually takes an hour or two if we seen every patient at this point it looked a little blood with me and we have generated this random list of jobs it's not random it is a very reasonable list of jobs that we have to do find safety discharge everyone so that's pretty standard so far things I really like about the surgery placement is that it's a lot more stuff to do than there was in my previous medicine placements and I feel like I'm constantly having to juggle things enter triage what's really important versus what this is what's not that important in there for prioritizing my to do list it's all well and good having this list of jobs but the problem is it a good thing to do that we carry a bleep bleep goes off a lot of time throughout the day when stuff happens that we weren't expecting Smite coolest because a patient become unwell and like I pulled by the pharmacy or by the pharmacist because there's an error in one of our discharge summaries or list of drugs the patient has to take all these things to happen so we as the bleep holders of the Junie dog is holding the blade have to be for anything that happens when the blinkers off so here is a list of things that I have to do on that particular day or the world run finished around 11 a.m. on that day we had 33 patients that's a bit more on the high side we we can usually manage bernosky what about 20 but 10 of them are going home that day so that for me and the other June adult to Joe we had to do 10 discharge letters and 10 was going to tto's which means to take out which means prescribing a list of medications that the patient needs to go home with this is sometimes simple let's say you have a 25 year old person who has come in because of appendicitis to have their appendix removed and now they're going home it's not that hard just came into Hospital on the 8th of May 2019 with appendicitis we did an appendicitis me routine follow-up required stop at a twenty-five-year-old is unlikely to be on any regular medication so you don't really have to do anything for that drugs list but what if that like 85 years old and they've been to unload him you painkillers for it and they've been started on a load of Willow molecular weight Heparin injections to reduce the rest of the risk of a blood clot forming in the 28 days post-operative. I'd also that come in with a ton of medication do you have to change some of them at that point it becomes a watch or on something you actually have to think about to do the discharge last night and to do the drugs list for the discharge letrozole you explain to the TV what happened in hospital and if there were any complications and how we dealt with those complications so often you know if we have patients were there for 2 or 3 weeks will take 20 minutes to half an hour to actually figure out going through the notes what was wrong with them until turn it into a decent discharge that to that GP would be happy with codeine or morphine how many days of in a Heparin injections should I prescribe them based on when they had the operation what sort of impression they had those quite a lot to think about some patients might be in a drug called Warfarin for something called atrial fibrillation which is an irregular heartbeat Warfarin thins the blood but sometimes we stop girlfriend before the surgery and so we have to think about how we change the dose to restart them on the wall friend or these are things have to be done so on this running Friday we had 10 different discharges to do about the other half what kind of complex and Sammy and Joe's for the work out between us as efficiently as we could while obviously you know being safe about it because just as nice as reported and the drugs that people take Hummels are very important and a big source of potential errors can happen due to mistakes on this on this drug trial that people take we've got a few other routine jobs to do so for example we have three ultrasound scan to organize are we like to do ultrasounds for people with cholecystitis or people with biliary colic so centrally gallstones in the gallbladder that are causing pain and we like to do an ultrasound to look at the neck of the gallbladder to see if there's any stones in there today we had these three ultrasound scans and ultrasound scan can you explain the hey look I go to patient this is what we think the diagnosis is can we do CT scan please because there's not that many slots for ultrasound you have to work literally about three-quarters of a mile all the way to the ultrasound Department have to wait to speak to a radiologist he might be in the middle of scanning patients because there was have ultrasounds to be today and soda send them to prioritize your ultrasound scan a based on everything else in there and that to-do list so you have to really be prepared to go to have to really have a story and you have to and you have to understand how urgent each specific question is how to have a chat with them and they're very experienced off his phone more experience and I am inside out questions and I'm like call Justin try and book these ultrasound scans to happen at the right time the other routine job that we had to do was we had to refer one of the patients to Gynecology because we thought they might have an abdominal problem but actually the CTS showed some kind of ovarian cyst and we didn't think that ovarian cyst would be a big deal but it's problem that you want to at least call Gynecology about and say hey look this patient's go abdominal pain we couldn't find anything on the CT but they have incidentally an enlarged ovary on the left hand side would you like us to do anything about it would you like to come and see the patient so that I had to be done I had a patient who had come into hospital with some kind of abdominal probably only one sure what it was we thought it was probably a bowel obstruction and then maybe it'll even perforated a perforated bowel is a really really bad thing you have all of the bowel contents leaking into your abdomen and that's not dealt with is going to cause you to get infection and die so that is a surgical emergency they got rushed to Fiesta immediately and the abdomen gets cleared out of all the crap that's going from the bow into the abdomen and then they get certain backup but if someone is very old and very l&r unlikely to survive emergency surgery and then becomes a point of saying okay I guess we have to manage this conservatively and keep them comfortable and so we had a patient who we suspected had a bowel perforation but there was no way that this patient's going to survive inside the case of referring to the palliative care team and asking them for their opinion and explain to the patient in like a nice way that we're very sorry but then there's nothing really we can do I didn't have to have that conversation the consultant was that so he had that conversation I was patient but we do what we have to do knee doctors that have to speak to the pouch canteen the Cardiology team and see if there was anything else that we could do to to make this patient's final few days a bit more comfortable and that was another and then while we're organizing these 10 discharge letters D3 ultrasound scan this refer to positive catch him we're getting a lot more bleeps from nurses across the hospital for looking after our patients so far gone for one thing is that when we discharged page on a controlled drugs like morphine and Oxycodone we have to print off a form on the system and physically sign it because controlled drugs have a lot more regulation behind a used you'll sitting in an office a lot on one side of the hospital trying to do your discharge letters and then you got pulled about the patient that you've done the discharge full that's literally a mile away on my way more like a kilometer away on the other side of the hospital because you have a printer this this this piece of paper into The English Patient discharged I've I've just go to go I go to sign this phone physically and I'm going to give it to the pharmacy then we do that there was another patient as well as we believed about why those on the way to do one of these control trucks phone and it was a nurse saying patient who which one of discharge Hub but there are Jehovah's Witness which means they're not going to consent to any kind of blood transfusion and they also don't want to be resuscitated to the DNA our do not attempt resuscitation in place in the hospital and in the community well and good but actually in order to get the patient home they have to go in an ambulance because they don't have to run transport and the ambulance crew won't take them unless they physically have a Jehovah's Witness kind of ambulance do not resuscitate form signed because otherwise what is the patient goes to cardiac arrest in the ambulance like they're not legally allowed to not do anything to them unless they have a physically signed form that explains and federal to have this witness and they don't want me substation so then off to join the control drug for across to the other Calico the middle way in the hospital to try figure out how to sign one of these phones that have done one of these before about the nest of the nice about it explain how to do it for the other eye details fundiform gave it to the patient ambulance crew came pick them up take them home while this was happening I got a few more bleach so one of them was about a patient I don't know what a few days prior and anytime a patient dies they have to have a death certificate done and this death certificate explains why they died again about the causes of death and if there's anything at end and if you don't know what the cause of death is or if there are certain other conditions that are and they have to be referred to Midas Corona and the coroner is like a service I think it is run by lawyers and they are employed by the state to make sure that when people die. we know why they died and that we know that that was not there was no foul play the collected the desk so unfortunately for this patient because they died within 24 hours of being in a hospital and going to go to the training program that we couldn't hear what surgery but because it died within 24 hours this is a little problem that has be referred to the Coronado by default on so we need to do a death certificate for this patient then we also had your phone up the car in his office and say hey look there's a situation and then they also load of other questions about exactly why the patient came in the hospital if you saw them. Feel free to the death certificate it's it's just one of those things that we have to do that again we can appreciate why it has to be done but when you're in the middle of doing all these all these other things it just adds to the list of this is a vitamin that I have to do because Italy it's illegal to call fun at the carnival patients have died within 24 hours of admission teaching every every Friday at from 1 till 2 will the F1 Junior doctors get together and we have a teaching session and that's a requirement for a kind of educational portfolio thing we have to go to that with me we couldn't do any any jobs on the water that our about about 2 I need to be off to add that was a patient who was becoming quite unwell and one sweet assess a patient we decided that they'd have to head that we want to do a venous blood gas and venous blood gas to the very quick and easy way of doing a blood test to see if there are anything seriously wrong with patients but with patience so we can look at something called lactate which is a marker of anaerobic respiration if that's high that's a sign of an unhealthy patient and we can look at the electrolytes like sodium and potassium to see if those are deranged and we can look at a hemoglobin is basically at the amount of blood cells that go in there buddy to see if they're going to bleed from anywhere is that were available and trains to do a vbg that's Alpha Sigma patient understanding the patient we did one of the BBC's ourselves we went we went across the hospital to the VVT machine put in the code for any password instead of inject the blood into the machine and give you a printout of the results and then that's quite I know because we noticed that there was a drunk in the patient's hemoglobin we thought they might need a blood transfusions this involves turning up a consultant out who's on Conan thing hated this patient's hemoglobin the truck down to 74 we don't think there any signs of bleeding Basin examination based on the history and I had a CT scan yesterday that show send the bleeding but do you think we should do a transfusion anyway because it was like yeah okay let's transfuse 2 units and then whenever you do a blood transfusion you have to take another blood sample from the patient to check the blood type and the antibodies against it because you don't want to have a blood transfusion reaction and again available taxi take. Blood within only do and they had to go back to the patient be sorry we have to do another blood test because we going to do transfusions we took another blood sample blood transfusion samples are go to group and screen and those are kind of weird as well because there's also the regulations around them because fusion reaction is a very very very terrible thing that can kill people and so there's all sorts of checks in place at the doctor level another laboratory level to make sure that the right patients blood gets transfused into the right patient that involves come labeling a thing out by labeling a format by hand I'll just print out labels lavender you have to fill everything out behind explain while you're requesting it then request on the system and then physically take the blood sample down to the lab which is another to the 5-minute walk and say hey can you press this is arginaid we need to do a blood transfusion about this is that very little of the day-to-day stuff of being a doctor actually requires an extensive amount of Knowledge from medical school like I often think the students were very worried that I'm not I'm just about to break into my glands are something that well does that mean I'm going to be a bad doctor I know a lot of it is about like the vast majority of it is about being organized and being efficient and being quick at doing stuff very little of it is based based on having another knowledge of of medical school topics it's important to be able to recognize emergency than to deal with emergencies there and then and be able to ask for help but like no one really cares whether you met you've memorized the you know the Krebs cycle or if you know need a little detail of something hematological malignancy that you're never going to come across the basics down on that you know when to ask for help and that you organized and that you have decent communication skills when you told me to families into relatives and stuff like that so that was something that surprised about being adopted like almost anyone can do it it's not that hard being a doctor and this whole culture of medical school admissions is very much based on the old you have to be absolutely amazing to get into medical school do you need Amazing Grace is so so hard but it's not that hard very very doable to contact an interesting and to be a good doctor you don't have to know everything the textbook and I think we can become too fixated on knowing everything that textbook into 680 done competing against other people in all year to try and get that price be able to have a to-do list being able to take things off of corporate leaving up to take blood and efficient fashion when you have to be able to walk quickly across the hospital being able to phone up at specialty and say hey what's going on standard ABCDE approach you're doing a systematic thing you're not needing to recall knowledge like it's it's going to be a bad thing if you're in the middle of an emergency in a resuscitation scenario and you having to remember the dose of adrenaline that you give to someone because the system and like the crushed Rollie is designed in a way that you don't have to remember this it will physically tell you and give you the range that is already made out to the right dose of adrenaline so you don't need to worry about memorizing those things by in case you haven't got an audience noraebang on but for things like memorizing other kind of drug doses memorizing mechanisms of action memorizing interactions in a phone memorize a lot of stuff you don't even know it off the top of your head and in fact having the having the confidence a shower curtains that you just know things on the top of your head is one of the ways that people sometimes make mistakes because you know you think you know the dose of a drug but you might have got number like how long does it take to just look it up on your phone and takes about five seconds is the official b&f the British national formulary up because look at every hospital has their own guidelines about different drugs as well so being a doctor not really about the stuff you know it's about being organized magic following structures following the guidelines and being able to ask for help when you when necessary thing about my replacement is that it never feels like it's dragging like there's always enough stuff to do that by the end of the day like oh my God I can't believe the whole day spas sounds like a pretty nice place to be an overwhelming but if there's too much stuff to do you know just about triaging appropriate and saying okay. Can't wait till tomorrow. Can wait till tomorrow that's not urgent will do that later and prioritizing the other things of that is a day in the life on the general said replacement I heard that was sending parcel Hughesville to people who are in medical school maybe you think he would like to Medicine oh maybe just interested in what happened as a junior doctor on a surgery placement"

            "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6NR6YQcxyA",
            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hear my name is Ellie in the final year medical student at Cambridge University this video we're looking at the Oxbridge medicine interview and we're going to be hearing from 9 different medical students who are offering that tips all these students have had interviews at various colleges in Cambridge watching the video to my friends Oxford and run the tapes by them and they've United Methodist at that everything that applies to the Cambridge interview also applies to the exit interview because the two are pretty much identical in terms of what they ask you the things you need to be able to do to do well in them you'll see a link to a video containing these same medical students his experiences of the Cambridge interview to find x * 2 or 15 tips so that if you want to skip ahead or if you've seen some before if you want to share a specific bit of the video you can just reference the appropriate time to time but without further ado turn on medical students talking about 15 tips for the Oxbridge medicine interview already hope you find it useful and I'll see you at the end what you don't want to do when they ask you a question that you don't know the answer to Is to sit there like you know the answer to everything it's that they can see your thinking process and they can see how you'd get the answer how you reason things so thinking out loud is super important. so tell me why you're getting that and how you might have progressed through it if they can see your foot process that's the main thing and they want to know I would say things like okay so what if we would just start with this concept or if we're going to 11 Cambridge question that was I find online I don't have to actually use it was how would you calculate the number of molecules of oxygen in this room so instead of just kind of sitting there thinking but how would calculate that I would kind of make it to my dog Bella okay molecules of oxygen need to find the volume of the room so I mean we could I believe that was probably about 6 Me to the Cross about 8 Me to the Cross maybe about 3 inches high and then I think I mean if we if we assume that we will stand of conditions we could potentially apply the gas gas constant like gold and like multiply that by the number of so you can get can see that I've been thinking out loud I haven't just been kind of retreating into my head trying to walk out with Beyonce's so that is the number one biggest hit for the cameras in TVs secondly I would say don't be afraid if you don't know the answer objective is not to know the answer the objective is to think about it and the questions they will ask you all going to be quite hard so you know if you're the type of person that gets flustered the right answer then that's something that you want to practice and you want to work on before you interview answer if you don't know say well I'm not sure I do I don't know if I were to Hazard a guess it would be this so that you make sure that you are at least using your brain and thinking about the question that's what they really want to see that you grapple with the problem intellectually I think again remembering that they all had to test you but they won't get the best out of you today in mind even when I couldn't I couldn't get an answer if it's one of the most science questions give me clues and that's really trying to bite me so that way it was good my main thing would be revised to Sciences in your mouth be ready with those when I used to get asked what do I need to know this level of chemistry and biology and do I need to know the stuff in chemistry and I'd say no you're a level syllabus well you know know your chemistry and biology really know the principles but I'm suddenly not unless you mentioned it in your personal statement you don't need to know super if you can shove it in Supply to reading it is great can you wish you'd be lost because you know about that actually asked you so they all asked you about high blood pressure and coronary disease thing about diabetes and heart disease exactly how much you know to start with I actually found like a machine to use refund which might make you think I'm a bit but actually that's really important to know because you should find it fun you should passionate about medicine about the science he Concepts that guy going because if you're applying to Oxbridge you're about to do a really science heavy cools so if you don't passion about it you will find his own place they know that spot where they do need to do they want your passion to show food so if you've got problems with being really anxious but interviews or you just feel like you don't know enough science example you need to be able to talk constantly and enthusiastically about science on the day because she hasn't shines through the interviewer who is normally electrified subject or a chew toy supervisor that subject will think this the person can think that I'm that worried he might they be really fun to teach me and I think that what you should be willing to do if you think that your bartender country don't be proud of intellectual hubris or whatever just that track and say I know that's a good point and then push the logic and reasoning from that oh yeah so I was told when I was in 6 phones always take a pen and a piece of paper to and pocket them Life as we mentioned before a lot of the interviews about trying to show how you get to a non so what's going and sometimes dads and questions really help with half a piece of paper paper edges I'm say out loud what they're thinking and sometimes it just helps so much when you can draw something you think maybe the graph would look something like this CSN questions get fretwell will be helpful especially if the people have had it all experience view themselves cuz I already know Sinister and strange and how to get use as the media would have you believe even if you think you've got the answer to just be slow with it sometime it's this you kind of want to like you know the answer you already have a little bit of my way I'm going to show off and like really break it down like why not Beyonce and that's where to get through this all about your thought process Sherry how you go through the motions and how you get there she applies to medical school again so smart people write books people Three Days Grace lyrics out ever be applied to Cambridge is like damn right so if the Cambridge interview was just about getting the answers repeat extraordinar Lee waste we are finding that out after all they could just do what they do every other time and sit you in a hole and make you do a test on the people who buys them a test to get in sparkly feeling because you know you're to learn what you were you're used to learn a lot of what you learn while your heater is stuff this but Wayne UT New Concepts new ideas new ways of thinking he says so to test what it's like when you're learning things you don't know when you are at your comfort zone before you learn they want to see how you learn and they only see that body they asked you a about lungs and you happen to have done a special project on lungs and all you've done in biology up until this point with loans and you are an expert on lungs don't go okay fine let's talk with kidney instead and get you right in the Box just means they'd recognize you and all that long and they're not going to get in and I can buy hearing you talk they want to hear you struggle through kidneys rather than least three months cuz if you can demonstrate for you you approach problems that you don't know the altitude for useful to them and finding out that you know a little cuz everybody knows a lot they want to see you can think so that doesn't require to be super duper intelligent it doesn't require you to know every lost fact about some specific disease it just requires you to be able to think on your feet in the day make sure that you're comfortable enough to just be able to think out loud they might ask you a question on something you know nothing about but just think of any relevant information you do have and try and use that he wants to question felt quite Liberty Bonds because they don't want you to be in your comfort zone while you're going to give the text acansa they want you to be walking through they want to see how your brain works they want to see how crazy you can think how sensibly think how you can link different ideas up I think keeping calm is a huge thing because if he freaked out in the middle of that interview then you might miss out on stages of the question and it's really important to keep focused because for the whole interview you might be watching one question it's it's in my experience it really wasn't the Y medicine why this college why this University questions it really was a science I think faith is on those but you said before pads cuz some colleges do D1 that's a bit more about your passing statement about your extracurricular things 1/2. Resume are you busy tonight preparation required for Cambridge interviews internal interview because it's unpredictable and practice stalking and being relaxed and whatever relaxation I forgot my Razor Barber and that interview preparation shout out to my friends who took part in the video I helped make it possible if you have any questions about the ultimate admissions process or about the interviews or anything else just leave a comment down below and I'll get back to you as soon as I can equally if you have any suggestions for contento be useful to you the medicine application interviews be mad exam revision at this anything like that let me know the comments down below and it would really help in kind of giving me ideas for videos that we could be doing on the channel so Alice movies coming out over the next few weeks about like interviews specifically I do some more stuff about the application process to do vlogs every now and then about life in which you might find interesting by"

Bro into the office I play my Spotify playlist from my first year of University and then get started on some discharge letters for patients that have gone home that week at 11:30 I get to Kohl's in a row 1 to see a patient with painful knees and another to prescribe medications for various patients on the ward sorting this stuff takes around an hour and I get back to the doctors office at 12:40 I spend the next 20 minutes continuing with my discharge letters and then head back to the restaurant at 1 p.m. to grab some lunch I happened to run into colleagues Specialties are also involved that day and so we chat for half an hour over lunch and then one of them visits my water afterwards and we play some cheeky table tennis in the gym for about 20 minutes. 150 I head back to the office to continue working on these discharge classes on psychiatry long and complicated and so I finished the first one to help us to and then popped onto the wall to rewrite a drop shot then take a toilet break or scroll through Twitter on my phone for a few minutes and finally I finished the second discharge letter at 3:40 p.m. at this point my day is looking great to be free until I decide to do some studying I get started on lecture for in the heart and circulation Series in human physiology the subject that I'm supervising some medical students in at Cambridge University an hour before losing concentration realizing that the early start this morning video meant that I only go around 5 hours of sleep so I had down to the Encore Junior doctors room to have a quick nap I managed to sleep for a few minutes but I put it to five I got woken up to review a patient who is having an anxiety attack I get back to bed but over the next hour every time I job in think I'm finally done for the day I'll get cold again to do something else eventually I'll give up on the stool of having an up and head back to the doctor's office to do some more studying I spend half an hour doing some more cardiovascular physiology and planning out my teaching session for the medical students from 7 to 8 again at the hospital restaurant with some colleagues who happened to be there at the same time I don't feel anything properly here because I don't want him to think I'm weird and then I'll head back to the office and spend half an hour making a start on the next series of cardiovascular physiology lectures immediately are I'd like to know that don't really make sense to me and so I bust out a PDF of a physiology textbook and breath on my way through it while thinking down this is a really good book I wish I discovered it sooner it hits 8:35 p.m. and at this point I've got 25 minutes left in my shift and I'm pretty and I won't get cold so I decide to chill out and watch a documentary about Alzheimer's disease I'm actually on my old Age II replacement at the moment then we see a lot of patients with Advanced Alzheimer's disease which is actually made me really scared about getting it when I'm older this documentary goes over the pathophysiology of the disease very easy to understand fashion and discuss it some of the ways that researchers are trying to reverse the disease process I'm watching it on curiositystream who a very kindly sponsoring this video stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform founded by John Hendricks who's the founder of the day Channel3000 of documentaries across old genres from signs in history to technology and lifestyle I quite enjoy watching documentaries is a form of productive procrastination so if you'd like to join me you can sign up to a free trial at curiositystream.com. into the coupon code at checkout you'll get free 30-day trial in which you can watch any or all of the documentaries that you liked anyway at 9 p.m. I hand over the evening on call doctor giving her the good news there's nothing else done in that needs doing because I've done everything today and wishing her good night ahead and so that brings us to the end of this day in the life video I hope you find a big interesting I've already done one of these videos before so I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments you want to see more of these is there anything else you'd like to see instead let me know if you like the video then list of some of my other blog ask videos have a lovely day and I'll see you hopefully in the next one to buy"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel can you hear my name is LA on the final year medical student at Cambridge University this video we're going to be talking about how to answer the common interview question of what did you learn your work experience the first thing to say is that this really no wrong or right onto it infected Freddy's interview questions any book that you read any video that you watch about how to answer interview questions do you need correct answer is what works for you so you ready what you should be asking yourself is what did you learn from it works. If anything and you know point of videos like this in the point of empty boxes just to give you some kind of idea of what you can say some kind of audio structure if you are a little bit unsure preferably the answer should come from within. That's the best way to answer these questions but because you have some level of stress anxiety on showing us about the medicine interview and that's absolutely fine we will have some element of nervousness before a medicine interviews has always good to come and seek out more information so I'll just say that upfront the correct answer is what is Pacific but having said that we've now got segments with eight different medical students where they talk about what they said in their interviews and give you tips about soda things you can say how you can phrase it that sort of stuff and then at the end of the video will have to mock interview on Thursday myself and my friend Kenny giving answers to the question what you do new experience put on swing it as if we were actually medicine Africans just to give you an idea of what a full-on to my look like and then right there the video I'll do this classic like comment subscribe thing and I'll share my own thoughts about what Ariens inmates value and I'm a little bit cynical about books. So if you if you care what I have to say on the topic then that's like towards the end of the video if you don't then you can just do the video for that point on just the tips on how to answer that question the eclipse of a medical students talking about what they said in answer to this question and tips that they would give you and I will see you very shortly because obviously you don't want to break confidentiality if you can talk about different things that you seen so far example and when I was in GP I told you about the fact that I noticed that my dad was so close to his patients that we live on a very small island in Kent let me live around I told you about how I love that there's a community feel and it was huge impact adults could have felt something that I left my experiencing actually that don't deserve it more than just someone that you see in a consultation life I'm how hard working adults is Westside like time they riding time that they laughed and told me about how I noticed that sometimes they were tired sometimes they struggled against sometimes I do take a little bit longer than some people to do some things because I like to watch through them and I'm at the factionist but I noticed that we don't do that they often under the oppression that not something that I would be working on during medical schools I'm doing. about any like what you seen because what time are you going to talk about the clinical thing but you seem so I told this disease will that do to the skills in the characteristics of the doctor is and how you can build it up within yourself that's a real good way to describe so I think the main thing is to share what you've learnt from it as everyone says it's always about what you've learned from it know how much you did and what you did so I would definitely thinking about the transferable skills that you see meaning of people use on that you have learned yourself and things that you want to run in the future so it's often things like Team Rocket operation being done and I talked a lot in my past the same and I'm in my interviews about how that team is scrub Nurses Day two technicians and doctors what really really cohesiveness you can also talk about the lessons that you've learned and things like I talk to GP before I applied to medicine and they sent me down and they told me about the financial difficulties they Inca on the system the Asian population crisis that were coming into now and things were things I put down saying I had actually learned from you in the Future Bounce I think they're being a lot about what I experienced was just say how tough it was going to be I think the main line ink when I took those out the doctors are trying to persuade means tell me actually medicines really hard right now to come into I'm not sure you want to do it for me because I think initially very and I was very much like mad since they will help people as great amazing job by doesn't always feel like that dr. Higher than that I think that's important thing to know because you have to go in realizing that it's not just this glamorous job where you're saving lives in life you know leading a team in Hazel of hardware I think in in the hospital felt I felt a bit lost and I didn't really do very much OS X just standing around so in that sense it was quite hard to reflect on I think that's the way things you can learn even when you're observing so I told him about the MDT that's kind of the doctor have what team so you could just remind him a bit about what it entailed it's good to pick up the most exciting medical thing you so for example the most cool surgery patient relations or how does this work together in a team dropping a few operation people is why that you need these super medical placement with lots of exposure to like all the procedures and all the healthcare you shouldn't apologize that you shouldn't prioritize going to a fancy National or international hospital over doing the pretty basic stuff is old people and other vulnerable people searches with learning disabilities cuz what they want you to learn is all of those complex issues with those demographics the patient demographics that you will have to face is a doctor rather than necessarily the ins-and-outs of how medical procedure they wouldn't have an appreciation of people and how to handle those people well on how to relate to those people those will really shine through much more when it comes to you being a medical student doctor then you knowing what a cholecystectomy so I passed Molina and some really important Point communication skills with old people and children with learning disabilities I learned that discipline for children going to spend it has to be completely different and you have to be. to change out your communication style depending on who you're communicating with I would say describe what you've done or which gave you some thoughts and reflections just generally describe your view of the question in like a mockingjay you setting if so we both tried to answer as we would have done at the time when we were playing two medicine and this will hopefully give you an idea of what an awesome but I mean after that for a bit of chat about what I think about love experience Country Healthcare System with the NHS and one of the things that that that really stuck that really stuck out to me from my work experience was kind of the attitude the attitude of the doctors they said the doctors felt that they were quite overworked quite underpaid and yet they were still a very happy happy to be doctors like although admittedly most of them said that they probably do part-time but I mean experience of kind of showed me that people who need people to do medicine and I'm hoping that they'll be prove me as well what did that with the biggest thing that I take away from my experience at quite a few things here in that Justin Blake Hospital essentially was helping patients with a personal hygiene so things such as toileting and things such as feeding and vital signs of a patient and so it was quite nice being in the hospital environment for another reason is like firstly it was raining it was experiencing a shift in the hospital the shifter I did was 12 hours long at the Days Inn thought that was really good to give me just a general sense of the connection patents doctors have and how you going to be able to kind of live your life while working so that's coming you want quave know she's on you but we stopped to see what a physiotherapist you want with phlebotomist you out with so many people just in different capacities that was good about the other Rosen. There's also a goodbye it's a see what life is like and the people bring different things to the table but over the carries patient-centered to interact with patients it's when someone else to it's essentially. One of the last times of that life and it and it told me how important it is to look a person as a person as opposed to as as a disease or as someone who's being with someone who needs to be taken someone who needs help wash so that was definitely something that I left for extra benefits from the 8 medical students giving that tips on how to answer the question and then hopefully you found it vacant useful to him myself and Kenny give a full answer to the question as if we were in an interview so hopefully that was useful experience my feelings about work experience just cuz I think it's one of those things that it's become like a like a really important part of the medicine application and I think the idea behind is that you start off thinking I might want to do Korean medicine and then you research it about it and then you do some work experience and then theoretically this work experience makes you think oh wow you know I haven't haven't experienced life in a minute Healthcare setting but this is for me this is what I wanted to go to the next 60 years of my life too and I think there's a mess of fluid. In fact I think it's almost like deciding that you want to marry someone based on spending just a handful of what kind of dates with them I'm not saying nothing inherently bad thing because I know an Asian culture on the whole thing and then stuff as well there's a lot of Value Inn, just meeting someone a few times and then kind of committing to marry them because they know that most of most of the happiness of a marriage most of the stability of a marriage comes from the effort that you put into it rather than pre-existing compatibility the works by Alain de botton the course of Love is a rather good book that I would highly recommend you read if you're interested in this topic but I digress to expect a 16 17 18 year old sorry if I'm discriminating against across students here but you know everyone discriminates against you anyway because you told us I think it's fundamentally unfair to expect at 16 17 18 year old whatever it took to commit themselves to Allah career in Medicine by just having a few days we had a few weeks experience in a hospital or GP because that doesn't tell you what life is actually like and even if it did even if it did give you a very good indication of what life is a doctor is like what's a good enough reason to to go for a career I was talking to my friends about this over the last few weeks in preparation for this video and we'll kind of sad sad sad summer things that experience we didn't really gain that much from it this is Hospital experience will gain from volunteering school for special needs students which was very good. Specifically about the experience which seems to be the kind of work experience that's like the Holy Grail of experience everyone tries to go to the hospital this kind of stuff because they think that hope it'll work experience gives them some kind of special insight into Life as a doctor and I think is unfair my friends actually agreed with me in this regard we do all kind of decided in advance that we wanted to do careers in medicine decide to be like science going to tell people it seems like a good option it's a very open ocean you get to spend six years at University of just so much better than spending 3 at University with universities incredible and everyone graduates up to three years regrets University of medicine and then we could work experience and we did work experience to take that box and applications do you experience like cardiothoracic Surgery Center in London and I was cool watching heart surgery for about 20 minutes and then the rest of the seven and a half hours I had absolutely no idea what was going on my Nexus or like even though they do the final year medical student I wouldn't want to watch a heart operation for 8 hours unless I knew what was going on because it's just a bit pointless and and this is the person that I like a lot of my friends also found without work experience we can really enjoy it just kind of following people around window to get in people's way like life is a medical student we didn't know anything about the medicine side of it and do anything we could glean from it we're kind of what the doctors hoteles and a mic what's the doctors are saying don't do it with a bad career and he don't make much money it's it's just not worth it I think the only useful things people get from experience or if you can talk to a specific patient or if you can genuinely see a good interaction between like a doctor and a patient and if that moves you in enough to make you think you know what this is what I would do for the rest of my life and I think that's quite a kind of a romanticized version of events that we put in personal statements and we say in interviews we say oh there was this one moment where I saw this amazing consultant to this patient and. Changed my life and I think that kind of the expectation when it comes to experience that you have these moments but you know I'm I'm personally very skeptical as to how many people actually have those movements I said you didn't have any the fly with the people that I also didn't have a single one of those moments on the books. some skeptical of is when there's no text exists and if they do and I also don't like the fact that the whole work the whole culture around with experience it sucks that you're kind of expected to have these moments cuz I really struggled I think that a lot of my work experience and emotional sudden cathartic where you suddenly realized oh my God it's like the ultimate career because I told his doctor told him to this patient and it was it was amazing it's because you genuinely thought about it and you realize it's like 50 years of your life devoted to constant like academic Pursuits constant like you know telling up to work everyday staying long hours but you do genuinely go to make take to make a difference in people's lives and I think I think that's why people should be doing medicine that's why I think this whole the whole this whole thing about what experience is volunteering should be part of the medicine application login but getting work experience in a hospital or GP today I'm very skeptical but like at the moment I really I really thought about you. I was underwhelmed but you still want to do medicine because there are many better reason to drink medicine other than I do. then again it will be interesting to hear your perspective on this back in the video despite the fact that I don't think I meant anything for my buddy experience I still think I can give a pretty good answer to the question and if you're in the same position as me what you did with it anything when you experience you still want to be able to give a good answer to the question because like it or not it is the state of the is important it is a checkbook you have to do it is part of the application and if you haven't done it looks a bit weird so hopefully this videos giving you some kind of insight into how you can answer the question but like I said what is the most important thing is that you were in a way that specific so if you did learn something from experience speak completely ignore everything just talked about what was specific to you I cannot stress this enough the correct answer is what is the correct answer for you that's corny and cliches that sounds so yeah thank you very much if you like the video please give a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the Channel please consider doing so and I will see you in the next one I would love with you"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is the very first video in a new series called medical Monday so basically when I started this channel initially I thought the audience would be almost exclusively in medicine applicants medical students but now thanks to like some of the videos it seems to be expanded beyond that so I still want to be making videos for medical students but I don't want to confuse everyone Monday's into this new series called medical Mondays so this video is a really long and really nice video I'm exclusively at people who have applied to Medicine in the UK and who didn't get any offers or who didn't make their offers interview with my friend Antoine reapply to Medicine if you're in the position of not getting any offers or not making your offer so that's my intro welcome to Medical Mondays and yeah I hope you enjoy this interview and everything is closed is going to be in the timestamp in the description below so will get into me and then tone for like 6 months ago enjoy he got into medicine Second Time Around we were talking about it the other day when I was preparing another video about what to do if you don't have any offers that will be linked up there and down here and everywhere had some good practical actionable advice from someone who's actually go in second time around I thought it would be really good for him to talk to you about it when you can get you off this time around ejections self-doubt originally am I good enough family, phooey Siri telling you that actually you know you aren't good this these things happen and you have to remember that life bidmc Chelsea give yourself a week to kind of motor around thank God this is awful thing right what do I do about it you going to get back home next year's movie quotes of all fees do I don't have friends who did the same as me for ejections next year will be one of those people that think snow you know what I definitely was terrible Academic Year so yeah she have mold did I have wrong with my application.. I said equity but I will reply was with invaluable if some leads and they sent me back a sheet of paper that essentially broke down what are my application is a school job said that. I think it was before I knew that I was actually pretty close to getting to interview I just had to change a few days I said that all the points were vital personal statement comparison statement that you didn't have. stop that. Who jump think that I saw it was rubbish as the first time around about how you don't need to go in chat with doctor for 12 months children with learning disabilities your free time and you are kind of fed sexual hours out so the thing to do something, see now that's really wanted to do cat home and it just said to you this is boring fully self Ashley Madison is a glow about that has myself but I wanted to be doing now we have to get out weekend near do something about what you experience where I make a point that I personally didn't want to experience that useful because you never learn anything vested related but I guess what I'm saying is that actually the point of experience necessary that you learn anything in particular it's at the very least just to show them that you have thought about this enough and you're dedicated to study medicine enough to jump through all these hoops and given the 10,000 people applied to Medicine having that has like a barrier to entry that you know we need someone to have done some kind of work and some kind of volunteering or some kind of time that's a good way of screening certain people out because everyone is going to have good grades you know you need other things to block people from getting into medicine I think Second Time Around was pesos only opportunities that came out in the year also I had and what you do with you I don't think it reflects particularly well on you if you just go daddy's money and fly off somewhere and spend a year away. Why do I feel like I wouldn't go Joe because I thought stop asking me energy process which state was really Goods which we didn't start dating until a full year of medical school where's we have to do like one of your units that they look perfect to take to come do something with I went away at the end of it sucked on the few other places without any conscious runoff got to go see the world because you got some time make sure they puke show me some life experience that quite lights. I'm he's doing this work experience and involuntary eye means I'm making sure your personal statement is well-written you got a lot of time to think about it I thought we talked about number one spend about a week smoking and then get over it and like to make a plan to get feedback from universities that she can the specific feedback that you go from leaves really help you out vacations I told you everything they want to see me I emailed them specifically for feedback but coffee or espresso stand with him what you want to take you through some of the things that were different between the rejected one I would be accepted one because when will be the amount of experiences I had so and just as evidence of the Actuarial bring this up for you to say cheats remove friends because it was one of my experiences where is it money successful one it became a single line in Canada. paragraph but just said yeah I choose a friend because I had other experiences plenti change for hello and see how I just found out I realize the introduction of more important just a line when is Winchester medicine came when I studied history individuals ignaz semmelweis and Ambrose a parrot profession of privilege to practice we put them up if you about how to make it into like a fairy would he senses it was like a whole life done so I'll read it like two days until something that you traditionally think of his medicine I didn't think you did say get work experience in the hospital originally I was denied because I was 19 some of you keyboard latency that might not be useful in some ways I don't have it late but I was able to actually get in the hospital x-ray department actually seeing go to Shadow around someone I was actually in the extra Department helping move films cuz I still use film be calm get access to and I think I don't have any points for extracurriculars anything like that play football for two teams when when I was applying Appliance medicine hour ahead of ahead of admissions to University that's cool I told us an interesting story it was he went to a private school cuz for some random social function and it was one of their getting into medicine to and they had like 50-60 people applied to Medicine Dental actively getting in and what their head of admissions set everyone is at right hands up if you're not on a sports team for the school and a few people for the heads up and he was like right join EU the dive team tambien on the basketball at this whole medicine if you don't have a sports a sports thing on your on your on your personal statement you have a year to become interested in a sport that very happy to accept beginners is a personal statement is probably the thing that you can improve more than grades ready you say anything friends I mean it's called Lonely this year off in some ways it's only supposed to be fantastic very well tell your friends I'll be around there at 10 easier because you looking back on it but you like cynical no time but she didn't pick one or two you know if you wouldn't reset the whole year you look just as hard as the first year did you just pick them or juice that you really needs to pump up you cannot see because you got so much time to give to it the other commitments you have all you a job or whatever but you can you can stop by if you need to I just went part-time for the initial bit and then increase my work two full-time as I go I mean by full-time because it is thousand pounds in a year full time with more than minimum wage as a GP widowspeak well-paid actually University with nurse dresses and prices Iowa Play Summer Vacation 2018 accepting section security Good Times I just got this back up chunk of money that's just about run out I'd say but I don't know why while I was here so if you're if you would have hypothesize kind of had you going in first time around versus taking that guy from getting a second time around do you think that over gladly to the Gap year or would you do still kind of wish that you've been at your head time around Styles homes excetera a really good time I think it's been very useful to how did you know you get additionally as well devastating when it happened so I didn't get in ICU is nothing it really doesn't make a big difference and you know these guys think I'm just yet which is the same age as me choice because I'm full I want Steve Madsen I vote the second time around I went with Newcastle to do they offer a transfer straight from Department costume another white certain times of until the fifth Choice then presumably that's that's like a list of universities that offer as a Segway description to the medic portal who are famous competitive 6 misfire Sophie's Choice one of the station's what would you do if you didn't get in and one of the cat was what would you do if you get it and I said well to be honest with you this is my second year replying so I didn't get in this time around except that I would try and transfer across to Mason and then if because I was going to get that second time around this time around is generally based on the experiences experiences I have one or two examples so I can I get cold when I just twisting and forcing them into the same the different questions they asked him why don't you mention all well you I went to the GP and I really enjoyed it that okay so experiences you done to prove that you want well I went to the GP not sure about poop. I had enough experiences from that year off you know that actually I never felt stocking point I had something different to say. under the Cambridge interview they asked me did I prefer I can help myself but to say well that's like choosing between drugs and alcohol isn't it we still get a bit of a chuckle want to take a nap here provided he doesn't use the word that got here you are vacation is very lucky to be better than most other non copyright the console hatching a second time and let's say you didn't have your volume at over from from Newcastle what would you have done with your medicine something else have to think I was actually fix Don't Dream It's in save I probably would have replied but I would have probably apply to something like by like biological sciences thinking I want you to get in that way to grab medicine I think I think the definition of insanity is trying the same thing expecting different results so don't make my patient back to the first time around. for that cuz I do not fight interviews to get a job it sounds like so if I can summarize what we talked about the one you mentioned that was quite blow but you Pulaski schools get feedback from the investing that really helped you out of mold your personal statement to the way it was what they want to do experience from volunteering Republicans and making sure you make the absolute most of the staff here has become most people that I've spoken to do you have 2nd Peter has been happy to be living up here in the other video what you should drink watch out there and everywhere else if you make them. Get more experience help you in life but will Sophie medicine application does a dozen of the video called 15 ways of my tips on how to prepare for interviews and one thing everyone says that you can make a list of talking points that if if I get off about communication skills experiences that you drool in from end Dimension Fest and round all you had was GP and you couldn't find everything which is pretty obvious when they fall asleep experiences you can just Brolin under I don't have to be all about them yeah it's better to have variety doing the best best years of your life site for the best just keep your head up what cause you're getting eventually if you have any questions runs on his leave a comment down below and enter video please I will see you next time by sick"

            "text": " my friend talk about the channel if you knew him today we're going to be taking the age-old question of whether an iPad can feasibly replace your laptop as usual to save you time I'm going to start off with a conclusion and then I'll be spending the rest of the video exploring the reasons for the conclusion yes I know think that for most people whether you're a student on not your iPad can probably replace your laptop does Lubbock have yesterday's it really depends on how much you care about efficiency what sort of work you're doing on your iPad on your laptop and so it's not really a decision to take lightly not wanting to be spending the rest of the video talking about I'll be doing that with reference to three main points firstly efficiency secondly complexity and thirdly the but first let's talk about efficiency and we can Define efficiency as minimizing the amount of time between thoughts and actions adult. I wonder whether Thomas Frank is uploaded a video recently that would be the source and any action would be going on youtube.com Channel picking up loads and single the latest videos to email a physiology essay to my supervisor then the action will be opening up my didn't compose typing in the supervisors email address taking attached finding the file attaching it typing something and sending the message when using your laptop to do the same thing on Mac and windows because he's really powerful system-wide utilities like Alfredo like the windows logo key that they let you search across the entire system's if you want to open a file you can just search for great stuff is still quite difficult to do a few things text selection in writing and things yeah you can do on an iPad to get the majority of my writing was done on an iPad just isn't quite the same experience with an iPad it's just a little bit less efficient so it really the first thing to consider if you're thinking of replacing laptop is how much do you value this efficiency savings if you would like me to spend 7 hours a day if not more in front of computer I'm doing a hundred the same time but so overall a very high actions per minute and the way I use a computer it's I'm doing everything I can to maximize efficiency of that I'm using keyboard shortcuts absolutely everything amusing apps like Alfred I'm using automation that were closing text expander the newest fancy feature is that help me shave off seconds off of a contraption that means I can't really replace my laptop with an iPad because it's just so inefficient but if you lock my house make money for example if she is a more normal computer user and that she has a laptop but you have several years on a phone computer the only thing she really does on a computer is write essays do research for projects and maybe watch Netflix I think money's use cases for students in that sense it is very reasonable to replace laptop efficiency really doesn't make any difference at all in the grand scheme of things I think we should consider the complexity of the actions or on a laptop pause the internet she brought this on Mansfield University and she makes the occasional PowerPoint presentation if you have to give a talk to that sort of wheelchair racing and running a food blog and doing also the other things of the life other than spending time with Peter massive nut and so would like to think that I use a laptop for complex things like video editing graphic design web development coding of some sort server management for my various businesses audio editing for my poor college music production if I fancy party Market funds into my audio interface and recording a song stop. Is fairly complex and yes you can do all the things on an iPad but it just requires a lot more to the Creole out more fighting against the system so that something that really consider how complex are play if you're a student and you're like most humans and not survive a massive note when it comes to computers then you can completely replace a laptop with an iPad the iPad it's just a nicer experience of roll which is about the Delights of using an iPad because of efficiency and complexity but I actually do use the iPad 4 more hours in the day than I use my laptop like anything that's lights you know browsing the web writing something planning out videos making notes Shuffle heavy lifting top things this iPad 11 inch iPad Pro 11 inch around his if I'm going home for the weekend and I know I'm going to be plugging into my brothers Monitor and doing some video editing otherwise that's I'm going on holiday I have no need for my laptop because I'm going to be doing video editing on holiday I will just take my life. stains on the keyboard that's on the way some of the pain on the keys is broken off because it has been using it so often but this is the device that I use for the majority of the day I take it to work at 8 to be able to replace my MacBook completely with my iPod but I just know that because I value efficiency and productivity issues not really going to be feasible if your student and you just getting basic stuff done that you can easily do that when I answer unless you're major productivity nerd like me you probably won't benefit much from the efficiency savings that come with having a laptop a real laptop to do stuff on instead if you're a student sing for productivity you want to first get to a point where you understand and you got your own protiviti system before you then stop optimizing for Speed sort of like if you letting musical instrument you start off paying it slowly so that you learn the basics and then over time you can speed up this idea of building your own productivity system sounds kind of cool any one of them know you should definitely check out my friend Thomas Frank's online quote over at skillshare in that one line Plus without taking off pretty good he teaches you how to manage a to-do list how to use the calendar properly how to have an efficient how to track your tasks and projects how to do weekly review activity order that stuff should definitely come before so they've optimizing for Speed and efficiency at using various devices so if you want to check out that part to email to call Link in the description that will give you two months of a free trial to skillshare and after that two months you can continue your thing which is less than $10 a month and you can watch those about their online classes including one of my own my own how to edit videos in Final Cut Pro type of thing which is like 3 and 1/2 videos I think it's like 30 videos and not where I live we take you through the beginning middle and end of my entire process for making videos exactly like this one so yeah if you're considering iPad vs laptop then consider complexity and consider efficiency and considered Delight hot is so much more of a delight to use the laptop but the laptop is obviously just inherently more suited to efficiency and too complex computer-based asks if you have a video of a dad that has my full analysis of that died in that video explore these various issues and give a recommendation based on various different factors so yeah hopefully we'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is La I'm a junior doctor working hybrid animals of the co-founder of a company called 6 mass and we've been running courses for the beam at the UK and introduced to help students get into Medical School 400 students every year since 20 video I'm going to be showing you an excerpt from my online bmac crash course it was just like a 75 + video series that pretty much God's you through everything that you need to know to do on the team at least you know on the technique and pesiri side so that you can then Linda practice reading practice papers yourself people who are taking the GMAT done to 8:20 definition of the basic formula that you need because quite a lot of being a FedEx is pretty much just about memorizing the formulae and you can do that and apply them in the questions then you can get most of the Marx right there are a few other videos that are available freeze or put the details of the online in the description below so you can have a look through the 75 + videos some sort of discount or I'll throw a battery system of physics electricity okay so welcome to the physics motion of this course and in this video again we talking about electricity electricity is probably the most every year I'm ready understanding electricity is reasonably durable and across these videos for cannot go over everything you need to know for electricity and be the questions that come up for electricity or reasonably straightforward like it's just and a series of principles about series and parallel circuits that you have to understand that spoke about the basics of electricity and the formulae that we need to know other ways of approaching this you could just memorize it and you'd probably be alright but I want to go a little bit beyond that I want to try and teach you a little bit of the understanding part of electricity because then like if you can visualize it in your head stuff becomes a lot easier when you have to memorize a few things then if you just memorize the formula but we're going to go to the full movie anyway as well of course so let's kick things off with a few definitions and first thing that we want to know is a charge a charge is a weird a weird thing to Define too much of that charge a physical property of stuff that means it exerts a force in an electromagnetic field that don't worry about it means the flow of electrons important thing about charge is that it's given the symbol so cute is what would appear in a formula that denotes charge not see if you see the word c in a formula it does not mean charge we need to be considered where we need to get into the habit of using the standard standard symbols for all these things because those are the ones electrons and its measured in coulombs which has the symbol c as being a singer refers to charge you will never see the word coulombs in a formula or how many coulombs in a formula because that's like saying in a speed equals distance over time is the formula speed equals distance over time it's not speed equals centimeters of a time so you would use the the quantity rather than the unit and disappointed keep going. To end this trips a lot of people and when we take the clothes in real life we always get people that right C4 charge and that so confusing please don't do that please write Q4 charge whenever you write in the formula the current is basically the rate of flow of charge or the like to think of it it's the speed of electrons it's how fast electrons are traveling in a circuit current is given the symbol again so confusing please like always refer to what is I when you're writing stuff down or informal never ever refer to current SC because it's just the most confusing thing in the world assemblies V and the unit is volts symbol is be as well so that's less confusing my voltage is potential difference but voltage I like to think of it as basically a measure of energy it is the amount of the amount of pushing power the electrons have as they go through stuff in a circuit to find all of those things there are some fulminate that I want to introduce to you a different color is V equals c over q that is voltage equals energy / charge energy is measured in joules charge is measured in coulombs to V equals 8 / Q is for me but we pretty much have to memorize and keeping ahead several times a number two is as we said the current is the rate of flow of charges the speed of electrons so I equals Q of a t current equals charge of a time and time is given lyrics T and is measured in seconds if you see time in minutes in the exam question you need * 16 converted to seconds cuz you know they're trying to catch you out there the measure of energy things easier when we talk about series and parallel circuits voltage is the measure of energy so the next thing released Define is resistance resistance how to find the resistance to the push of electrons in its I talk to find it without using the word resistance resistance means it's hard to get through anything the resistance is given the symbol R and it's should in the unit ohms and again you will always see are in a formula you will never see the omega symbol for ohms in a formula is the symbol for resistance is are the unit of resistance is Ohm's and that's important to keep in mind pieces of the formula number 3 which is Ohm's Law Firm in the most famous formula. V equals IR voltage equals current times resistance one more thing we need to Define and that is power out what is the symbol for power and the symbols of power is p p is what he was in formula and the unit of power is what went through which has a symbol W so that'll joke that what is the unit of power is defined as the race of transfer of energy sounds complicated think of it as like how how much energy you are using for a second so basically energy per second and that is p equals 8 of a t power equals energy over time for the amount of energy electrons are transferring in the case of electricity per second power important and that formula number 5 is p equals IV power equals current times voltage and actually a few before you can rearrange that you pretty much get energy overtime but people's Ivy is already bought one to memorize because often comes up Medina as electricity for me. That we have to plug numbers in 268 some sort of a combination of number of formula four and five so technically you can drive it from 4 and 5 but I think it's useful to remember cuz I in the past and it's quite easy to remember and that for me that is E equals I TV enough energy measured in joules is current * * * voltage in the UK the six basic electricity for me to be nice to know we've introduced those please please please memorize those please memorize the symbols and the units cuz those are very important I need the with Mason II it's really important that volts and amps measured in volts and amps volts and amps power current is a measure of speed okay voltage is a measure of energy and power is like energy of a time like how much energy you're transferring per second and resistances is resistance has been helpful to introduce some questions on we can go over these in detail because I'll show you the method for answering pretty much every physics question to be not with a plug is formally and will hopefully get a lot of marks in the Beamer just by using the soul into them getting some of the basics of physics and the link in the description to the beam of particles is every year but also I think to be my ninja which is the website that me and a few friends made a few years ago that it's like an online question back for full of being up so and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " right so I'm going to break down what I learned from my full-time job of being a junior doctor in the UK's National Health Service alongside with a breakdown of five different sources of passive income but before told about the numbers there are two main reasons for doing this video the first one is to get views but more important to this entrepreneurship passive income Financial Independence. I've benefited enormously from people on the internet being open and transparent about their income in the revenues people like Pat Flynn and Grimes have to do a lot of the things that I'm not doing today and so even a a tiny tiny proportion of people watching this video instead of thinking what if I can Inspire passive income Financial Independence and hopefully I'll get some views along the way so that's my virtue signaling over that's get into the the juicy details now so these are only real numbers from Monday the 23rd of March 2028 the UK's National Health Service at a hospital in Edmonds which is a town in the east of England and Ghana quality placement at the moment is round about 38,000 pounds a year I am sort of in the equivalent of my intern year if your American System I'm not quite a resident yet but I'm up to some sort of like a is about 15 lb and 36p an hour each month 73 basic hours 25 hours out of hours which comes out to 3054 lb in 76p and then because I work around 1 and every three weekends I got a bit extra for that so that's around about 200 pounds a month so the total comes to 3000 155 lb + 7p so if we break that down kind of in this week let's talk with the Monday and on the Monday I work a normal day shift which is 8 in the morning through to 5 in the evening which is 9 hours and total 9 * 15 38 lb in 24p to that is like my daily Standard wage but of course all these numbers away before tax and nuts Insurance in NJ pension contributions and student loans and all the other kind of stuff about the top line revenue rather than the post tax version active component of of mine, let's not talk about the six sources of passive income and I'm going to break it down on a day-by-day so the first one to mention is YouTube AdSense Revenue you see before most videos on YouTube essentially anytime someone watches One of Those ads YouTube pays a bit of money to the person who made the video and so on Monday the 23rd of March I made 95 lb in 66p from best views and that was because I had 97723 views on the Monday which is round about 1 pound per thousand views and I'll explain a bit more about how I'd sent works as we go through the week but the next thing is there is an online platform it's like a it's like Netflix for online courses and the way you make money on skillshare as a teacher it's sort of like Spotify streaming royalties how to become a recording this video anytime people watch those I get paid for every minutes of Premium what's X if every minute someone with a premium account watches the videos and so on Monday I had 3086 premium minutes watch time and actually only had one Falls in skillshare this will it cost if you want to edit videos in Final Cut Pro from beginner YouTubers I made this class way back in September 2019 and it's been generating passive income from people watching it every day on skillshare since then I 3086 minutes what time and so on the Monday I made $169.73 off of this one cloth I filmed in one day way back in September 2019 on that has just been generating $100 plus a passive income every single day since then on it's absolutely affiliate programs referral link then the company will pay a little bit of a commission to the person who sent them to that link so I have ended still Sheriff video think that if anyone signed up to a free trial skillshare using that link then I will make $10 and that's still chaste out of the program I think they changed the rights to so apps that I use avocados and videos and stuff the biggest one for me is the paper like screen protector for the iPad videos about and epidemic sound company that provides videos on YouTube if any time someone buys a paper like screen protector from my special link or someone signs up to epidemic sounds using my special think I'll make some affiliate Revenue and 43 cents off of these Partnerships is the Amazon Associates affiliate program Amazon has the world's biggest affiliate program essentially you can earn between like 1 and 10% Commission on all purchases made of if someone went went to that product using your affiliate link answer when I send my email musetta's out every week and sign up and pillow and if I recommended book I will put an Amazon affiliate think that because retropie my latest video to spend which I liked I think of that pain and if someone spends in a 5lb on Amazon using to think I will make maybe 1% or 2% or 3% expensive stuff so for example if you were eight photography videography YouTuber like Peter McKinnon you probably making a load of money off Amazon affiliate links because they're supposed to stop the People by clicking on your links are expensive cameras and expensive lenses and stuff. sorry the books I've recommended a few books and videos and people buy the books or a pen or like a board game or something nonsense of the US program for total of $10.74 on Amazon from affiliate links at least not directly was $313.90 so I guess you kind of a rough idea of who the other day is kind of expanding the bits that are relevant 38 * 24 Watts 120 3956 use which was quite a lot more like 30% more than I had the day before but that was mostly through a video with got demonetized did make any money off of those so actually I go a little bit less AdSense Revenue because it's only monetizable videos that you get revenue from so I made 94 pounds 83 on that day from Hudson that's pretty reasonable. I had 2961 minutes what time for a total of $162.86 there were two people that sign into my skull sharp anything says $20 and then from my other 50 Partnerships like the paper like screen Patek I made $118.69 and then I'm going to a company called six matter which runs classroom courses and question banks for medical school applicants and that's been running since like 2013 stuff that happens that money before anybody gets to me so that in this video but a couple years ago I made my own online video courses for the account to be Matt and Medical School interviews which are things that people have to do to get into med school in the UK baby was it 24th of March signed up to the my direct stuff is not too many other people in that business from the $23 was to that effect of my active income was $172 was $551.79 again this is income that is not directly tied to my own time for a total of $724.21 for Tuesday Wednesday YouTube AdSense wise 96042 views Revenue dropped a little bit so that's 90 lb in 52p they can see that my cpms which sounds will cost per meal which is the amount of money you get paid for thousand views I make about one pound per thousand a kind of varies depending on what soda company make so my tech videos have much higher cpm's maybe 5 lb per thousand views my book videos have practically nothing CPM live maybe like 10 pennies per thousand views it all depends on who is Avatar videos of companies that advertise on Tech videos for an American audience are going to have more money to spend than the source of companies that advertise fantasy books for a global audience and it and the CPM right, vary depending on where the people from India CPM globin Gene bureaus maybe like 10% of buildings Unfortunately they don't make much money at all because there's not many companies advertise an Indian thing with money for it but to be 25% or so of my American audience contributes a lot to the cpm's because lots of companies want to have it to American viewers because American viewers tend to have on average more money to spend on product so that's why the CPM rates vary and then you get people like about real estate in about how to make money online they have more money than tech companies I had 4026 time for a grand total of $221.43 nothing from still try and then the other Dollar Tree one and then I made 2 lb of 33 Pete from the UK market and $2.12 from the American market for a total of $5.03 for a daily active of 172. passive income of $503.62 for a total of $676.04 for the Wednesday is this one so I'm going to assume that I made no money that day activities in reality just divide my annual income by 365 days but that's a made no income because I feel like he didn't even though one of my iPad Pro unboxing videos on Thursday the Channel 120 2698 views for a total revenue of 166 pounds at 9 p.m. of a skillshare we go 3959 minutes of what time so it seems to be hovering around between 2 and 4000 4 total of $217.75 I got two people signing up to my skills right. Thanks thank you very much for ever you were for $20 and I made $187.05 off of the US I think because someone canceled or offer a refund for their order and therefore the money go ducked up with me for the side of it so passive income was $634.05 Friday it was a long day 8 a.m. till 9 p.m. that was a 13-hour shift so I made 199 lb of 6822 $243.21 3 people signed into my Social Links it's $30 and then affiliate marketing various lengths $128 60 and then nothing from the UK but in the u.s. had a good day in the US on May 17th $0.68 from Amazon and then one person signed into the UK Costco's online active income $249 passive income $694.02 total $943 a total income on the weekend it's interesting because weekends are usually long day shift starting at 8 in the morning I get it to work and then I leave work at 9 in the evening bonus for working on the weekends so in March I work two weekends the first weekend in the last weekend of March answer at 200lb divided amongst those four days of the weekend so I'm assuming that each day of the weekend I made an extra 50 lb on the Saturday 28th of March I made 249 pounds 68p from what is 58470 views on YouTube iPad review videos videos tend to do well the Avatar the front so that overall I made a $264.41 off of that until chat 3937 minutes of what times are $216.54 $182.05 off of the affiliate income and then Amazon UK to pound 95 thank you and I was in US $11 91 for a total of $15.60 and then one person sign up to be not crash course online which is it downtown or $123 total of $311.48 of active income and $765.98 of passive income for $1,077.46 Saturday and finally Sunday 249 pounds 68 Peaks the same as a 127996 views on YouTube which made $208.96 3500 minutes of what time is he or she makes 190 two people sign up skillshare premium for MyLink $20 $191.79 and 7 pounds in one p from the UK Amazon and only $3.47 off of the US buy a scary people in the US with no shipping on Amazon on Sunday for total of $12.24 to $311.48 passive income $630.33 in this week I worked in my job as a doctor for 63 hours and if we take the weekend bonus into account that's an overall hourly rate of 17 lb of 67p an hour which is roughly about $20 an hour a lot of people come on my videos to be my how do you unsold little if your doctor and you probably thinking of America notice once they're fully qualified 1/4 times as much as UK. It is so a consultant which is a high step of Doctrine UK which you tend to get to off the age of about thirty-five a consultant doctor in the UK starts off at a roundabout I think 70 or 80 thousand pounds which is about a hundred thousand but the median income of u.s. dollars is about $400,000 depending on which specialty you doing and if you do more work in the US can make over $1000000 a year just off of that stuff it's quite hard to do that in the UK Hellcat system unless you're really deep into private practice is really hard to make a lot of money as a doctor in the UK I don't think anyone's the median salary across the population okay is I think about 21,000 lb so then what's that $26,000 is still on a lot more than the average person in the UK but it's just nowhere near what you can hunt in the US anyway but it takes me an hour to drive back and forth from work and so I had 12 hours of travel time if we include that my real hourly rate becomes a 14lb at 85p an hour before tax my life over will far outweigh the snow and that is a place where I have always kind of wanted to get to but always like never really thought realistically thought I would get there even though I've been trying for the last five years to come different sources of passive income science and computer science courses uni is learning how to code it was because I learn how to code and let you know when I was like 12 13 in secondary school and that's Wickliffe High School in the UK and are used to do little jobs for small businesses that's how I made money when I was I was I was a teenager I was able to set up my business six Med in 2013 and through that that sort of snowballed into 70 different things and learning how to code is in my opinion one of the very useful things that you can do with your time especially if you're video and nothing else to do. It is a very useful thing you can do with your time fantastic introduction to computer science course that teaches you all about the world's most popular programming language so you should definitely check that out and the company would pay me a certain amount. disclose for including that sponsorship message in this video is this particular in general if enough people click on that link and they will continue to sponsor my videos so if you're interested or anything else how much they paying you for sponsorships does numbers can vary for example Casey neistat who is a huge YouTuber with 10 million plus subscribers he said publicly that for each sponsorship deal he makes somewhere between $10,000 and $100,000 video on some deal he gets even more than $100,000 per video I am a fraction of the size of Casey neistat but it gives you an idea of what sort of money people on YouTube did YouTube AdSense Revenue was 947 lb out a few things a few months ago I made a video breaking down how much I spend in a week and the total that was 701 pounds or how much is that $879 I spent what is a week and that includes my mortgage payments bills food in a Christi car insurance holding various apps that I pay for things and I make more money than that off of YouTube AdSense and this Play on YouTube make a living but if you can get to a certain side you can get a certain number of views reliably and you can keep on turning all the videos which means that those videos get more views than also your older videos more like spaghetti is you sitting on this really interesting source of Revenue because YouTube is one of the very few platforms where we at the creators make money but he was the audience don't have to pay for anything like it's such a good business model where there's value being exchanged all fronts hopefully you're getting some kind of value from the video and hopefully this video is well with dehydrates old and you don't have to pay a penny for it which is usually in a way that means they test you for what you want so it's really fun it's very doable yes it takes lots and lots of time and effort and hard work to kind of get there and we can we can I buy sleeping making at least one if not two sometimes three videos a week for the last almost three years without really missing a week of such and so if you willing to put in that level of kind of consistency then you can get to level where YouTube income easily fund your lifestyle and but easy I mean like one like always they take that used to build up and at the store I made no money on YouTube and then I was making like you know a few cents a day on YouTube and I was making maybe $100 a month between 3 and $4,000 a month off of YouTube AdSense alone and canceled my lifestyle pretty much indefinitely until this is a great position to be in I didn't really think much about skillshare that's been sponsoring some of my videos and it's good it's like Netflix until a friend of mine another Creator told me his own classes on skillshare and gave me a hint of how much money he was making us so his like skillshare. Kind of Revenue paid I was like woah and that made me realize that you can make a few thousand dollars a month off of skillshare with just a handful of online classes activist to create these multiple streams of passive income is money that isn't directly tied to your time and what are the easiest way to do that is by selling something online and often the easiest things to sell online or educational materials because you can teach something well then people are generating quite happy to pay for an ebook for a digital download or online course and they get buddy out of it because they help them to make more money make money online that's what I do I made this quote about how to edit videos if you want to become a YouTuber and now it made one about how to study for exams which isn't included in this and I should have lining up lots of different social classes that I'm going to be making over the next few months because they have to be beautiful skillshare is that the distribution built-in I could make these on my clothes and sell them on my own website and charge more money for them but because I'm mostly I've mostly go to student audience I like the fact that they can get two months free trial which means they can just do my taxes without paying I'm actually the very reasonable Grizzly pricing almost anyone who's go to Netflix membership can afford $9 a month for a social membership at it objectively better for your life I like skillshare not sense and another thing you go to become a teacher on skillshare because it can be so lucrative and like we will have something to eat if you're working this now and you think you know I don't know what to teach you probably do have something and if you don't then you can teach it because one of the great things about being a then teach all the beginners you don't have to be an expert to teach other people like I wasn't even noticing for two years before I made the school should I file but as someone who was a YouTuber for two years from scratch I probably had more of an idea of what began as a going through then someone who was a 50 professional video editor would be able to appreciate what someone who doesn't know anything about video editing actually needs to know to edit videos well so this is selling horses in your own website another way there's a few different ways but still Sheriff from skillshare from the film I've made $1,428.86 this week I'm done is more than my full-time job exam doctor I work 60 3 hours to be to work 75 hours until 2:15 to travel time and I'm making more money without having to do anything at all except occasionally reply to a comment that is absolutely insane if you told me a few years ago this was going to be the level where I'd be at with the whole passive income thing I've been like oh my God that sounds like the dream just to illustrate how can a teaching online can fit into a wider passive income strategy on skillshare specifically the amount you actually make per minute what time does fluctuate month to month depending on various back to the link in the description to their official like a teacher handbook page theft but please don't walk away from this video thinking that if I get this many minutes watch time I'm guaranteed this much money there is no guarantee it's all based on various factors just like we used to. Since there is no guarantee of how much money you going to make to video it depends on a lot of things are outside of our control ways teachers can do it that we can just try to make the best of possible that gets the most people so yeah this thing to take away from this video shouldn't be this is how much money I'm guaranteed to make if I start teaching online instead of pure illustrate that teaching online can be a way to supplement your income this whole exponential independent stuff has been one of my very few goals in life ever since I first discovered it when I first read Tim Ferriss the 4-Hour Work week which is an Incredible Book you should read it question to ask doctors and and friends and stuff at work and when I was a medical student is if you won the lottery would you still be adopted in about half of the people say no they would leave immediately one person that was talking to a few you know I probably leave in the middle of the operation that's how much he didn't enjoy medicine but he has to do it because it pays the bills pick up the phone but I would do it part-time not one person in my last life six years of Awesomeness question to every doctor that I mean basically not one person has said I would still be adults with full-time I sort of realized it's very early on in my career if I'm just being a doctor I don't want to get to this point where I'm not looking forward to going to work on Monday and I'm feeling like I'm Shackled to my job. Enjoy full time because I have to be in the job to pay the mortgage to pay the bills and that was kind of what started me on this whole like idea of descendants. If you can decouple the amount of money you need to survive from your full-time job that means that now when I go into work I'm not doing it for the money because actually I'm making a lot less money from work than I am from other stuff I'm doing it because it's fun even though the same job I'm here because I want to be because I have to be make such a difference to my own happiness I think actually make you better at presentation General Assembly friends in Investment Banking in low and management Otsego absolutely hate their jobs but they need the job site built is the main benefit of this passive income stuff if you can create the streams of passive income then that point and if you want you can leave if you wanting their part-time if you want you can stop something else it gives you the option where is not having that doesn't give you options oh no it's a full-time job it's probably better to sell your butt if you don't have your cell yet you can stop by and one of the Great about creating content of the things you should check out Gary vaynerchuk stuff if you haven't yet one of the great things about creating content on the internet and giving it up for free like on YouTube is that when you do that you build up an audience of people who know like and trust you hopefully and so then you recommend a product like genuinely the paper like screen protector I absolutely love it I've ordered one might open on an iPad Pro icon stand up me the iPad screen with other papers electronic to make it feel like paper writing on it from me and so people who watch we'll see that's a genuine recommendation and will be more likely to buy the product for 3 years my YouTube videos or any other results so good it cost like $15 a month what is an amazing thing answer it's no effort with me to plug those because he's a product that I actually use and love again if you seriously consider creating content in some capacity there are people who are making six seven figures off of affiliate income blocks blocks blocks with Abby recommending products from the blood gang and from doing it well but now when they sell stuff through the blog change my lifestyle and then some overall was $1,389.44 and my total passive income was $4,093 and 6 overall in that week I made $5,483.13 to the main message of the videos that if you if you seen these numbers and you thinking down the sounds good then I would recommend of financial Independence and the two videos is a good one of here about 10 tips on furnace if you thinking of starting a business that is the one to watch another video called three books that changed my life about three books that changed my life. you'll become inspired and you will start like I can pretty much guarantee you will start your impossible to frontal dependent passive income"

            "text": " aprons welcome back to the channel in this video on a shed 5 productivity tips that I found very helpful at times like this where we are stuck at home pretty much doing nothing with oldest social distancing stuff going on at least may I want to be productive I want to get stuff done 5 productivity tips coming up in one year's time will I regret not starting today because when we decide to do especially at a time like this for long. Of time I think it's it's really helpful to think about doing a service to our future selves and I find that like if I off myself the one of your rule the one of your question then I can bring those things to mind like you know a year from now I wish I were better at guitar I wish I had to have black book reviews on my website I wish I'd started this aspect of my videos my videos I wish I'd done that thing I wish I'd been going to the gym will seriously I wish I've been taking my posture and stretching and stuff I know a year from now I will regret not stopping today and I find that really helps in terms of helping me figure out what's actually do with my time took friggin play my city or med school I was studying psychology and I had to Lotus had time on my hands and part of me was tempted to restore playing World of Warcraft but then I asked myself you know what would my future self once and I haven't have a camera in my room and said that was the time when I first told myself how to play the piano by Fun on YouTube tutorials and stuff and that would have happened if I hadn't thought about the one-year rule back when I had a gallon to Freetown in my third year of med school so if you're at home maybe consider yourself a question that in a year's time what will I regret not doing today is a good tip to help us guide the direction that we should be heading so video about a single highlights like the one thing that we're going to focus on full day so it to me the highlight of today is to film this productivity tips video stick figure out like a website and we architecture, personal website like the one thing that I want to get done today to make today or when I list in my notebook I have like three sections I have HG in El so the H is what's my day Highlights today film protiviti video BG is something I'm grateful for having something to do during I want to let go of fear I was just coming in to send out of my mind because I watched loads of yes Theory videos this morning all about embracing discomfort and leaning into the fair doing stuff and I are about doing certain things once I know what direction pointing everything kind of fold into taste nice when I get from the daily highlights to do list of everything else we want to get done in that day so for example this morning I sat on the desk with my cup of coffee which is now very cold and so very grateful. this morning I thought down off during my highlight think I'm grateful for anything want to let go of a whole list of things to do so day in the life of love which is kind of cool Nonnie's my grandma fiction video script. I need and Alive video but I think it's it's very helpful to have this kind of listed to do so that in the back of my mind at this light element of me knowing I have more stuff to get done which means I'm more likely to get my current thing my main hot out for the day this video done quickly because I don't need to tackle these other things on my to-do list and the other way of thinking of it is that one way of thinking about a to-do list thinking about it as a sort of stuff that's weighing you down but the other way any of it to do that as obstacles in your path that you're going to power through and the way I like to think of it from a friend of mine said who is on the rugby team and Lexie Sports analogies about as a series of things that even a passion so don't get done some empty my mind onto the page I pulled out my morning dump actually Tuesday Morning dump to do list anyway I empty my mind and write down everything that I might need to get done for you is that if you're struggling with being productive during social distancing or whatever if you need to be productive I think I was just writing out a long list of things they want to get done that day and then what I need to do is write down everything that needs doing that any given day everything but there just something nice about doing the morning dump the Weslaco all the money favorite through the pens until I talk about this in my latest monthly favorites but yet but yeah it is very good anyway time that we allocate to it so basically the more time we give ourselves to do something the more time that they will take if we give ourselves less time to do the stuff we need to get done it will get done in that time and we will experience this like the night before deadline the night before an essay words I missed you or whatever we just get it done if we know it's do 3 months from now then we'll just procrastinate will put it off a little This research that we don't really need to do and probably it'll be no better than it was if we just did it like a few nights before I already found this which is party I like having this whole long to do list of everything because if the only thing I wanted to do today is just from the video I would inevitably procrastinate all day and end up doing absolutely everything and then at 8 p.m. I would be okay honey video so many other things on my to-do list which basically comes with manufactured up this morning when I was like you know what are all the things I could spend to get done today even if I'm not going to get one of them done with her in my mind when I get stuff done efficiently which means I can be more productive because productivity is doing the things you want to do as efficiently as possible so we can packed in service to a few cells and have fun while we're doing it that's pretty good definition actually yep that was before 5 is for finding ways to get out of a slump we all have those moments when we're going to bashing through a to-do list for treating it as like popsicles we're going to tackle out of the way but when it comes to roundabout like are you at me instead of an hour and a half an hour to an hour after lunch that's when I feel real Slim like I just want to stop doing nothing or kind of in the evening around seven 8 p.m. time even if even though still got that stuff today what we can do to get out of that slump the first one is coffee so I drink a lot of coffee in the mornings but I try to avoid coffee off to like to 3 p.m. because there's some evidence that caffeine stays in the bloodstream for about 9 hours and that means if I have caffeine after 3 p.m. my quality of sleep is going coffee before 3 p.m. I was making peppermint tea actually helps me get me out of slump because peppermint tea is not really caffeine free and so even if it's like 7 p.m. and I know I need to do like a vinyl window to get some work done then peppermint tea don't worry about the caffeine side of it cuz it's caffeine-free and they'll help me get out of a slump and only thing you can do is to a quick walk out so I put them in gym supplies on the balcony that I'm going to be working at work today because going to the gym is a terrible idea during social distancing don't touch my Facebook hopefully everything will be alright going to the gym during workout even just kind of going for a walk around the park that's one of Thomas Frank's favorite techniques Eli every time he's in his La Michoacana goes for a walk is like genuinely do an online course on brilliant vakani sponsoring this video and I'm not just saying this because it's wanting this video because even in there the last videos that are not wanted by Brian I still sometimes go on break in and do it online course but if you haven't heard what is on math science and computer science and the great thing about those at the very interactive it's not just didactic teaching it's not like watching Elijah it's like reading a little bit video singing animation and then ask you a question that puts everything into perspective in that you actually work you're in mind so a few days ago I had like this whole day in the life thing I was I was filming stop and go to about like 10 p.m. or I still have the stuff to do but instead I sat down and I did an introduction to Newell Network schools in Brillion because it was so interesting and engaging I was finding out about this neural network stuff which I've always sort of interested in because I know especially in medicine in your own network AI image recognition chest x-rays CT scans in ECG Imaging but this was accessible and engaging introduction to how image analysis works on that front by myself am I going to finish the first few lessons and of course I'm done the daily challenge this is another good featuring preme you can check out all the time I've done that I felt like my whole brain was rejuvenated answer again exercise your brain what causes a math science in computer science there's no time like the present no time like now to yeah that's how about we talk about 5 tips of productivity we said number one one-year rule in one year's time what would I regret not starting today and doing a number to the power of the daily highlight from that book make time one of the three writing out do list in treating as assertive bashing through multiple things in a given day number for pockets in throat bearing in mind that work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it so we should limit our time allocated to certain talks in order to get them done by finding ways to get out of a slump so I'm about to do what popular songs right now drinking peppermint tea the doctor 3 p.m. drink some coffee before 3 p.m. because there's little evidence that coffee improve it like brain stimulation self how I manage my time as a Doctrine YouTuber that has like eight different time management tips we talked about Parkinson's though I think everything else has seven other tips do not mention this video."

this side that's going to be stuff that we we should do we think we should do this I think I should revise some chemistry is actually realizing chemistry so thinking that you should do something doing something okay separated by got right now in the middle of people have this concept of motivation motivation is where you feel like we're it in in order to do in order to revise chemistry I have to feel like revising chemistry so my feeling like doing it is what's important motivation and this is something that's because obviously if I know his revised history then discipline is the way forward reitzer how I feel about her is completely completely irrelevant but you know how I feel about him and this discipline is where we cut motivation completely so to me I don't like using the word motivation are transferable from my vocabulary cuz I think it's on helpful anytime I find myself thinking oh I'm unmotivated but having said that there are things we can do to increase our motivation because this discipline thing is like an audio State of Affairs I don't subscribe to this idea all the time I think it's important to have is like an ideal that we look as I did this would be the

Which antibiotics you give someone based on what sort of bugs are growing in the local area we've gone up cord micro guide they'll usually bust open my iPad Pro with magic keyboard and I'll start my daily note in Rome research some days I like doing the morning Pages thing on room where you just kind of write 3 pages of whatever kind of comes to mind but these days up for the challenge for myself that everyday I'm going to write and so are used to make a salt in my writing and run I can if you want to find out more about how he's grown up at like 6 videos in my workflow series of nebula details in the description about specifically how we use Roman how it fits into my work once I'm done only open todoist and I usually check that a couple of times a day because that's my to-do list app of choice to see if there's anything that needs doing during the day then up into lunch I'm saving more lives and productive downtime when there's not much I will have lunch break these days I take these Tupperware type things to work so I can warm them for lunch and dinner and sometimes breakfast pizza from the Fitness Kitchen in late I'm up this for 3 minutes in the microwave and then I will sit at the computer with my iPad Pro in front of me and notion and Rome Open on the Windows PC at work just before the macros in the Tupperware and I will add those to MyFitnessPal which of the app that I'm using to track my calories assuming there's nothing going on the ward that needs my attention over lunch in the doctor's office and do some more writing in romantic notion either my iPad or computer how do I choose between the two usually I'm writing stuff in room when my writing on my ideas or a video plan in the embryonic or in the fetal development stage and then I'll usually transition over to notion to write the final script for the video or the final version of the article or blog post episode of How I use them together because they at random intervals throughout the day I'm also checking my email on superhuman decline that I use on my iPhone and iPad I'm only replying to messages from my team on slack replying to messages from other school friends at University of friends through WhatsApp and of course scrolling through Instagram and Twitter randomly I'm trying to do less of that but it just always again assuming my lunch break was uninterrupted with pipes used to head back to the water onto another cup of coffee at some point during the day I'll usually make it a point to come to put on one of those Mustangs not a selfie of myself using the default camera app and I will edit using a color grade filter preset thing that I've got a customized that I've been using for the last two years which just makes the images look a little bit nicer if you want to see this of stuff than most saving lives from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and then at 4 p.m. I'll hand over to the evening team and then I will leave work so hang out in my scrubs clothing put the apples in resume the thing that I was listening to on Audible Orchestra or occasionally Spotify now get in the car and set the direction for Home on Google Maps because that lets me, navigate and tells me what the fastest route home is on days where I'm being my higher self I will immediately change it to my work today Lookout which I track on Google Sheets I used to track my workouts on Ocean but then I go this online personal trainer and he uses Google Sheets of themselves earlier today it was a little chaos which is book number 7 of The Wheel of Time series what's my favorite fantasy books that would be the order that I recommend listening to these fantasy books if you want to play for the first time that's an ideal day like very occasional look at home changed my gym clothes into account but usually I just end up sitting on the sofa best work on my MacBook Pro connected via USB C cable to this cute ass 49 inch LG monitor with my keyboard in the morning while I was on the ocean on the toilet I looks at my highlight for the day so for example today to film this very video so then I get to doing the thing that is my highlight for the day off to work on on days where I haven't decided what I'm going to do I'll just have to do it sponsored video schedule along with all skiltrek costly schedule to figure out what's the best use of my time fully text you hours a single take the music on the homepod or more off and I'll have my airpods and I'll be listening to my fantasy audiobook on Audible and open circle in a little window at the edge of my screen so hopefully you can stay on the camera or I'll have my iPad Pro in front of me just connect to the lens so I can see a vague outline of the video again that's all done in Ocean again more details about that in the work by 9 p.m. but it is 9:40 today so I think I'm going to finish put in the microwave for 3 minutes and that would be my dinner sorted for the day of course I'm going to put the calories into MyFitnessPal and then for the day and I will try to do some music practice didn't bring food Justin guitars online can I get our teaching course which is how I taught myself guitar and Ashley music production bring up some chords for particular song using the Ultimate Guitar Tabs app on my iPad or my phone out of going to play a few songs and occasionally I will film this on my iPhone with the front facing camera record it and post it on Instagram on igtv music practice again when I'm being my highest self then I will think you know what I'm going to do some productive entertainment and I'll watch a documentary on curiositystream a double speed because I don't do anything largest documentary streaming subscription platform with thousands of documentaries raining from also subject that often I will pick a documentary that looks interesting to me and I can watch a double speed as a way of like entertaining myself. free access to nebula which is the independent streaming platform that me and a bunch of other creators are making a ton of exclusive videos on YouTube including 15 videos now in my workflow Series without reference to few times or I deep dive into like the really naughty details about how I use these various apps how they fit into my workflow to make me happier healthier and more productive curiositystream in nebula is literally the best deal in streaming right now if that sounds of your street if you want to see more of my physical security stream.com. at this point it's usually about 10 p.m. and I think about winding down for the night so initially I say hey Siri set relax and then all the lights go warm while usually turn on night shift on my desktop as well because partly blocking out blue lights is a good way of kind of getting your body ready for sleep at least that's what it says in the book why we sleep which is very good by the way if you want different scenes and that would be like my filling setup which is DeSoto play relaxing piano jazz music I'll set the alarm for 6:30 on my iPhone and put it on the wireless charger on the Chester drawers that is a pretty on the opposite side of the bedroom to my bed so that I'm not allowed to have my phone in bed and then usually I will get into bed and while I'm in bed if I still go any to any writing do for my thousand words of writing for the day I will finish them off using room or notion and then within my daily check-in on notion I will fill in some more questions so one of the questions is what are your three biggest wins for the day or three things that you grateful for cold who wants the life that I started doing for the last 2 weeks that's where I ask myself what is the most Story Woody moment of my day so think about a moment that I could potentially turn into a story of some sort or not I will write a few sentences about it in the ocean since like I don't know the beginning of May so yeah that's just a way of reflecting on my day in a way that I've never really done before but I find them that ready to help me at this point usually 11 p.m. and if I'm feeling particularly tired I would just turn the fan on I use a Dyson fan thingy cuz they look cool and quiet nice to sleep in the bedroom I know that I should be in bed anyway I will grab my Kindle which I always have on my bedside table I'll turn the brightness right the way down so that it doesn't strain my eyes too much and

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need me my name is Aaliyah I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University. In this video I'm going to be answering specific questions that you guys have sent of the last few days about the oxygen Cambridge medicine interviews there's a video on the channel already about experiences of the Cambridge where eight students talk about experiences and another one called 15 tips for the Oxford medicine interview which has the title suggest has 15 tips for the ostrich medicine interview questions along with timestamp so if you have a quick run to that list and see if there's anything that you'd like to play to be answered then you can click on the appropriate timestamp otherwise you can just watch this video all the way through and hopefully you'll hear some useful generic advice for the Oxbridge medicine interview so everyone should I learn all of my A2 bio and chem I've heard conflicting advice for this and so I'm not really sure should you learn all of your AC biology and chemistry this is a fairly common question because cameras that give you the supplementary question are so you can tell them what subjects you've done what you haven't done Oxford to get ready and everyone says the office interviews by science 8th which it is which sort of implies that need to know all the available syllabus I think the is that question is no you don't need to know all of your age of biology and chemistry but you should be pretty good at all the stuff you've done up until this point and only when you have the interview with about November December time which means you're a few months in to get that teen I just need you have done maybe one or two topics in biology and chemistry of a to put turn the rest of them and they're not expecting you to attend the rest of them so please don't think that in preparation for your offers medicine into you you need to go and look ahead and find everything in a to chemistry and biology that you haven't yet done and you need to brush up on it because you really don't you just need to be pretty good peopleready covered if they do ask you something. You know you will cover an A2 but you haven't done yet then just kind of make it to the Man interview but you can be like a boss by the kidneys you can say oh well we haven't quite cover the kidneys yet that's all I would say don't actually have to know much it's not really a test of knowledge as you'll see in the 15 tips videos of how you can think on the day and if you know a lot about it because you're epq it's cold was in lungs and here you know your dad is a long respiratory physician and you just know everything about lungs and they ask you about long as it's just a bit unfair that you already know about the kidneys instead because what they want to find out is you can think and how you can kind of beetle a topic that you don't already know. So in answer the question should you revise your AP biology and chemistry you should revise your volume chemistry of the stuff you've done up until this point but don't feel like you have to go above and beyond in the subjects that you haven't yet covered if that makes sense okay how much detail do you need to know about stuff in your personal statement I know it sounds stupid but for example if I mentioned that assist with diabetes how much depth do I need to know about these conditions I need to know a bit more about it than the average person would be expected so if you did mention. Assess your personal statement be prepared to the question what is this is how does it work be prepared to explain stuff about you know semi permeable membrane osmosis whatever however. Dallas is what statement you should probably read up a little bit Wikipedia spree all right in terms of how dialysis works why do people use dialysis what are the different types of dialysis does like peritoneal dialysis does like arteriovenous dialysis basic questions. A quick scheme of Wikipedia will be able to tell you the answer of what about if you mention diabetes in your personal statement you should be willing to answer questions like what is diabetes how does it work what are the different types of diabetes type 1 type 2 there's diabetes diabetes is like a few different ones and you should be you should know how we managed diabetes you should know what some of the challenges are we treating diabetes diabetes what it was and you should bake Libby weather in a drug companies are trying to develop lots of drugs for diabetes because it tends to be rich people in which countries that get diabetes rather than the 34 people won't be able to for the drug so you don't need to know the exact kind of pathophysiology of how diabetes works for like the exact molecular mechanisms by which insulin affect harder than kinase receptors and how that causes a change in conformation structure and that how to activate slightly A&P and how that so you do any of that stuff because that's what you do but you do need to know the basics if you mention it in your personal statement so if you read the Wikipedia article about that topic and make sure you can Vega talk about it if asked what constitutes as recent news for example does Charlie Gard count as recent ethical news and does the flu jab cluster count as recent scientific needs so the reason for asking this question is because everyone doing the interviews is concerned that they're going to be asked questions last year when the junior doctor contract was a big thing that was the thing that one was concerned about that but you know being trying to be brushed up on the junior doctor contract this year I know Charlie Gard any recent still so it's feasible that they might ask about the Charlie Card case and about what kind of ethical issues that raises in 2015 that was when the Montgomery routing happened and that changed everything with regards to Patient consent so the Montgomery routing was really popular. Here for you no questions they might ask in a car that has a thing this year I eat in the last 12 months before your interview constitutes as recent news they might ask you about however if there is something big like the Montgomery case when it comes to things like consent even though it happened in 2015 it still useful to know about it so Focus your efforts on kind of being aware of medical stuff that happened in the news in the last year but you know if it's big like the new doctor contract that was a year or two ago but it's still quite Vegas still quite sore if it's big like Monica I'd like the Montgomery case then you want to brush up on those things if you don't know where the Montgomery cases don't worry I put a video of that coming up at some point but if you have an interview coming up soon is pretty useful to Wikipedia Montgomery 2015 and see what the deal was with that yeah recent news 12 months to be honest at Cambridge and Oxford they tend to really talk to you about recent current affairs but you're applying for medicines you should probably know about what's been happening in the news recently but yeah told months is kind of the rule of thumb that I would follow before you do if you have a complete my blanquil this. Talkin about a topic you've never heard of but should have covered so I can know before for example I have an underbite kidneys ngcoa levels it's the last topic we doing a 2 Okay so this kind of goes back to questionable one would you do if it's a topic that you don't know anything I think the first thing to do is make it clear to them any kind of a nice way that we haven't quite come to the kidneys yet but you know I'll be happy to run tackle this question anyway if that's alright another thing like yeah go ahead or they would say something like that so don't feel as if you know if you get something that you can pick him on black tone don't think that you have to kind of bluff your way through it because that's that's not the name of the game especially with Oxford and Cambridge interviews that they really want you to feel as if you're in a teaching session with them so if you want a teaching session with them and they all asked you tell me about phase one of the Krebs cycle and you did know about phase one of the Krebs cycle you would say oh I'm sorry I haven't quite gone over my notes and that I'll be happy to answer any questions and give it to you yeah don't worry if you if there's something that you haven't heard before just make it clear to them that probably haven't done this yet but I'll be happy to have a go and then have a goat what you should do what you shouldn't do is say is that get ready for us to be like crap I haven't done anything by the kidneys and then exit of either come out with it though it's unfair for you talking about the kidneys so I didn't mention in my supplemental questionnaire or you know just kind of being confrontation in that sense obviously that's a bad thing to do you know if they occupy the kidneys and you have another kidney has yet to tell them we have another I'll be happy to give this question to go and that would be absolutely fine okay question about 5 does mental health stuff count as scientific I know it seems weird question to ask is just that I've constantly been told of the Oxford and Cambridge don't consider Psychiatry as scientific so not quite sure where that comes from and what the purpose behind the question is mental health is definitely scientific maybe 20 years ago when the rest of the medical profession so Psychiatry was a bit like maybe than an expert in he wouldn't have whatever kind of looked down upon you for mentioning something Psychiatry related or something you know depression or anxiety or schizophrenia related when you talked about science but these days that's not the case you should be prepared for the scientific questions about schizophrenia if you have mental depression or anxiety or any kind of mental health topic there is a big scientific basis behind that Psychiatry is a medical specialty please don't sing. Psychiatry does not count as scientific enough what does not count as medically it really does and if it doesn't if you get any kind of within your interview that they're discriminating against you because you mentioned something mental health-related and bring it up afterwards something mental health at Oxford and Cambridge is particularly in the Limelight because of the higher rates of being a mental health a higher rates of people trying to commit suicide and stuff like that kind of situation so it's something that the Limelight is always on and most colleges really good at trying to deal with mental health people I know who had issues with mental health have found found a little support from the colleges for the most part so I don't think you have anything to worry about please don't get flustered in your interview because you have this worry that mental box braids are fundamentally incompatible because it just a question of sex is about interview tips in a bacta Praying for Oxford interviews and ready I think the best way is just do Muk luks pretty interviews with your friends like get your friends a list of questions you can find some on the internet probably of questions they might ask you when asked them to kind of scientific 8 if you come like there's no such thing as the perfect Oxbridge interview question so don't feel as if you have to get like a really legit first in a primary source in terms of what questions have I asked but it's pretty much anything that would stretch you scientifically yeah you got a friend who's doing did you know Mike's on you you have any connects ask them if they can kind of quiz you about an aspect of Economics then teach you the topic and see how you respond to that or they can talk you know about coming for us and see if you can get to the solution you want me to doing it but ready in terms of preparation that's the thing with Oxford and Cambridge interviews that bit cuz it's so much based on what you come out with on the day rather than what you know before then it is generally quite hard to actively prepare for if if I prepare you mean trying to you know do that one thing that will make you guaranteed to get an offer or do that one thing that's like a Silver Bullet cuz it just doesn't work like that all you have to do is just kind of confident with a topic that you've already done the Vegas mayor ICD quite familiar with the stuff in your personal statement and then as they give you more information as they teach you a topic you just want to respond to it as you naturally would the objective isn't to help you trick your way into Oxford or Cambridge it's like and just to make sure that there's no kind of information disparity between people who coached for and people don't like you going to eat dinner store like other school that has a high proportion of students going to Oxford and Cambridge they will tell you all this stuff about the Oxford interviews and nothing I say is going to be anything new but if you're from a school that doesn't have that many students it just doesn't exist and if out what this person benefit for most out of teaching would this person thrive in this environment and if they want to see things that you wouldn't then I can say in this in this video is that you can do preparation wife that would help you because there are some people that just already compatible with that and that's what they're trying to find in the interview process so I know it looks brand to you that the whole the whole what kind of Aura of mystery surrounding rocks in Cambridge right to the best at everything else is inferior that's kind of what the media says and when at least one I was applying I kind of bought into this I was like you know I'm going to reach for Cambridge because Cambridge isn't the best anything less than the second-best and therefore I would have felt kind of personally inferior have an orca into Cambridge and I think that's quite an unhealthy way of looking at it it's more that it's a different style of teaching and the point of entry to see whether you would Thrive without start of teaching so again advance to kind of really properly prepare you for it but generally knowing stuff in your personal statement knowing your sciences and kind of doing a few more interviews with someone is probably the best way forward a question about 7 I think I count is there a catch it's about how you think and how to EWR but surely there's more to it than that I'm pretty sure everyone applying to Oxbridge knows how to think about okay is there a catch no there is no catch it really is about how you think and how you would think that everyone applying to Oxbridge knows how to think like I'm possibly the phrase knowing how to think it's a bad way of putting it because again that implies that if you don't do other than Oprah interview then you don't know how to think but that's not how to say are you able to order from first principles reason out a topic even if you don't fully know the topic and some people have the skill and some people don't if you don't have the skill you can develop over time but that's are the testing like can you can you take a selfie pic that you know about it can you kind of take it further and further and further until the point that you don't know about it anymore and then if they teach it to you how well would you respond to that how teachable are you that specific started teaching so no this is no real touch if if you know a lot of Science and you can reason things out from first principles and you'll do while I'm not speaking to you but again it's not even about that because with medicine they don't just looking for for a sign can come across as quite Pleasant maybe like stuff around it like if if you would interviewer and you were interviewing someone to be taught by you you would necessarily looking for the people who are so scientifically profit on it if you looking for the people that you think all this is quite a pleasant person I can imagine myself teaching them and enjoying it so the subjectivity of being personable and being because it is all about kind of the personal contact that you have with the end of the interviewer if it wasn't it would just they would just give you a test result unsa and not bothering to Buena tool for the reason for the interview is so that you can get this kind of one-to-one relationship going with the interviewer and they can is this the kind of person I would want to teach at in a year's time when they come when they come to Cambridge when it come to my college is there attached if it just about how teachable you are and how well you can think I did pretty much is I would think about is how well you can sing think about it can you think of this particular style and can you respond to it appropriate on the day and can you be kind of like personable and friendly and nice enough that they would think you know what this is the way to go about interviews is to approach them as a general conversation that you're having with an equally interviewers don't think of it as them interrogating you about a subject because if you think of it like that you're not really going to come to withdraw into yourself you having a chat with some people who might want to teach you next year and I think that's like a much better way of thinking of it and can I help you with doing well in the Oxford interview HSN chogada X strikes again is the question is a Seven and Seven is good idea or is the question how would you go about setting up a 7-Day NHS or about Charlie God is the question tell me about the child of God case or is the question what ethical implications does it have or is the question if you were the judge what would you do what is the question is about the topic answer you're going to give but in general if you want to start your answer is the one that I use is the standard that you learning English evidence and Link 2.4 accomplished I had an interview today why do you want to do an academic Foundation programme I would say my point is I wanted academic connection program because I think it would be really good for my future career I'm interested in medical education and I think an AFP and education would springboard my my future career what's the point of a bit and then to the point number two. I said via like also I really like the fact that we do a pgce to post graduate certificate of medical education alongside and I think that learning the education Siri would help me improve as a teacher so I've been teaching little courses and things for the last five years and I've recently become too big on teaching medical students as well but they would really help because of this out of evidence-based approach teaching for thing that would I'm finally I think that doing AFP would let me do some kind of project to the medical education so good a few ideas I think that's one of the main reasons I can do it put it alongside I'll have a supervisor I'll have a department in education institution behind me which would help make it more more official and in a more acceptable to do as a project so yeah that's why my career will help me improve my teaching another three because I like the idea of being able to a project that's evidence and then at the end I've kind of drone it all together some people say that you know tell me about your communication skills you would follow block communication skills and in the end you would think it back to being a doctor you would say and this is important because of doctor should have good communication skills I don't agree with that personally I think a good structure is I think this noon explicit link back to Medicine I think that's very kind of a mature way of doing it and if they see it happening in an unnatural way that instantly screens of this person has read an interview book that they're over prepared that memorized answers that's not good instead whenever you question you want to end with a good summary of what you just said so it might answer about why wants to do an academic Foundation programme I had three points and at the end I said so another one because you'll be good for my future career number to because it'll help my own teaching style develop a number 3 because I'll be able to do a project on that confident note. Is that the kind of waffle on a bed and then they kind of Peter out to add and so you might say something like so he has a table to do a project and and yeah and I'm kind of scared of a bit for the next question you have answered the question you gave them points 1 2 and 3 but it's like an essay you would leave an essay without a conclusion so I think with all of these questions if there is a direct answer the question that are asking you restate that right on through the end in a kind of like a confident way how do you spell transistor carnifex question like the seven the NHS like Charlie got my answer is it depends what the question is make sure you answer the question and make sure you and again without answering the question because the worst thing you can do in an interview is no answer the question question what are the most common medical topics Oxbridge like to ask about state of the current NHS Etc experience and from the experience with my friends we didn't really get any general current affairs east of in Oxford interviews how to say the letter off gate that's not to say that no College off without it but like I wouldn't worry too much about trying to pass but I left that in the ultimate question about 3 or whatever it was if you do it say it is quite useful to have a knowledge of carnifex. Global Health stuff in the last 12 months cuz that's considered very current and that is fair game for them to ask you questions on so yeah that pretty much wraps up this video hopefully I've answered these 10 questions about Oxford interviews and a recently legit way so yeah all the best really hope you catch the same days until they are quite hard and every one of them thinking that I haven't done very well so if you are out something looks like a very easy to be but don't worry about it if you have anymore questions results live, Dublin this video and I'll see you within like a few hours if you'd like to like suggest any more videos we could be doing any more questions just like Levi YouTube on Snapchat DM on Instagram DM or whatever and I every time I get when I kind of make a list of it and put it in my to do list of videos to make please consider doing so more videos coming out about more General interview stuff and Vlogs about life as a medical student and finally have a lovely day and I'll see you next time"

Feel kind of goes away because realize that no one gives a s*** like no one actually cares whether you're uploading videos to YouTube you might think it's like the biggest eel in the world oh my God what is my mom going to say what my cousin's going to say one of my friends University going to say but no one actually has everyone is so worried about their own lives the undoing YouTube no one has the fact that you're going to start a YouTube channel talking about whatever you want no one hit and we just need to get that into ahead and this is such a such a common fear and we all have it and it's just the first thing you have to get over basically no one cares stop deluding yourself into the people are thinking about you because everyone is worried about themselves they worried about how they are appearing to other people this is thing in psychological the spotlight effect which is that we will walk through life thinking there is a spotlight trained on us and just not realizing that everyone else is an absorbent life and we are only two Heroes of Our Own Story and we are supporting cost and everyone else's story if they even thinking about it. Don't YouTube channel do not worry about what people will think 99% of the fear is in just before you publish your first video Feist I promise you Publix on that video with the fear will disappear and you will stop worrying what people think then we have in gear doesn't matter at the stars in the long run filming on my iPhone I did not have any microphone attached to it I literally just got the camera lay in bed pointed at myself and said hey guys I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm going to start some kind of long can you absolutely nothing about anything I just folded free YouTube tutorials about how to edit videos and that's what you have to do when you get expelled it's like if you're starting learning how to write it doesn't matter what pain you're using as long as you're writing something if you getting started learning how to draw it does not matter what pencil and what paper you using that's all a distraction what you need to do is pick up any old pencil you go trying open that you got lying around the house any other piece of scrap paper and just start learning from they want it's the same thing with you to really if you're watching this you have a device which is capable of recording video you have your phone if you want to get started on YouTube screw the gear don't think I need to wait to upgrade to a fancy-ass camera before I'm allowed to get started on YouTube start with whatever you have stopped with your phone and you can always upgrade later and in fact over there is a video where I told him about exactly how to start feeling videos with just your iPhone but no one will sit through about only politics that's the first thing to upgrade and if you want to learn more about exactly which get upgraded like a shopping list for Garrett different levels you should definitely sign up to my part-time YouTuber free 7-Day email course this is totally free you just enter your email address and then every day I will will you with a long-ass article which contains lots of tips about getting started on YouTube and one of those in the 7-Day course is about exactly what gear you need to upgrade and in which order and I'll give you different levels figure a different budget apples 7 Days of emails from me where I give you my top tips on getting started on YouTube as a beginner we have don't worry about the numbers once you started on YouTube this is a mistake ever own eggs that you way too focused on the analytics but not the start like it doesn't really matter you have to do is just keep on producing more and more and more videos and not really worried about the fact that no one is watching them and that you're not getting very many subscribers if you look at the stats of the average tunnel with 1000 to 10000 subscribers has made 152 videos so William a252 videos you do not have the right to complain that you don't grind on YouTube you have to make 152 videos first and then we can think about how to treat your growth prospects on YouTube to me it took me 52 videos and 6 months to a thousand subscribers that was making two videos a week 6 months while I was a full-time medical student at Cambridge while preparing for my final year medical student exam TV is awake six months and then I had thousand subscribers and so at the very least if you made anything less than 52 videos then don't worry about you subscribe account you can always email me for advice or sign up to my put on YouTuber mailing list and reply to emails not only for devices online but I can't give you any advice you've made at least 52 videos that's how it works in your favor so we just calling you just going to do it and don't care about what people think but succeed on YouTube you want to think in terms of stacking the deck how do you take the deck and how do you stuck it in your favor the extent to which depends on how you thinking about YouTube if you're thinking about you Julia the hubby where you don't actually care about the numbers and you're thinking so it would be nice to make money from this further down the line but it's not my primary aim right now and that's great you don't need to worry about stacking the deck in your favor but if like a lot of students at all quotes about time you Cheer Academy you thinking of read more of a business opportunity so the more business entrepreneurial people by the end of the spectrum edu then when I think about how do I stack the deck to try and grow on YouTube what to try and get a cheap my goals for YouTube you know as effectively as possible you can start the deck in terms of time or even stacked the deck in terms of money how do you stack the deck in terms of time well it involves putting in the time to learn how to get better on camera which happens over time as you make more more videos animals putting in the time to get better at editing videos again prettiest more more videos I got a friend code James Johnny was grown from 0 to 500000 plus subscribers on YouTube by making like 10 or 12 videos of something stupid like that because he spent hundreds of hours editing each one to make it crossed into a perfect Netflix documentary call video he is stacking the deck in his favor by spending large amounts of time hundred hundreds of hours writing scripting and editing his videos the other way of stacking the deck in your favor is by using money answer number two you can invest into hiring your own team which is not what I've done and actually a lot of people don't realize that you can Outsource video editing for quite cheaply very early on and so specially if you have a job where your time is worth I say more than $10 an hour you can easily outsourced getting to someone who you're paying less than $10 an hour to if you want in the way of stacking the deck in your favor but using money and we'll talk about that more in my part-time YouTuber free email really it's all about stacking the deck in your favor and whatever way you can depending on what your goals for YouTube are are you a hobbyist or are you a entrepreneur business person I'm somewhere in the middle 6 use your unfair advantages now I've got a secret three-part formula for Success on YouTube and in fact success than anything in life and that is Success equals work X luck X unfair advantages now work you have to put in the work you have to put in the the efforts to do this otherwise lock your kind of relying you do you have to get a little bit lucky but the good thing about luck is that the more videos you put out the higher the odds that any one of them will get picked up by the algorithm in. Go viral for my channel it's only been like two or three videos in the last three and a half years I have one ready bar old I really propelled Channel growth everything else has been fed average batting mediocre so that was work and luck but the third component of the success equation is unfair advantages what are the unfair just that you have that you can exploit in your YouTube channel or in whatever you're doing for me myON fried Vantage without I was a medical student and I was at Cambridge University those are pretty big unfair advantages because the nice that I was targeting what's people applying to study medicine at Cambridge University I was not trying to be a makeup influencer I was not trying to be a fashion influencer already lifestyle of workout or Fitness influencer none of that would have used my unfair Advantage maybe the medical student thing if I was actually interested in Fitness think about what are the qualities I have things that other people can't necessarily compete with compete with even though we don't want to think about this is a composition what are the unfair advantages that I have that I can use to help Propel my channel be my book club episode of a book called the unfair Advantage which is all about the formula to success where I chat with only old is Hassan about the five different types of unfair advantages and we talked about how to answer this question of like well I don't feel like I haven't even want this because everyone has advantages you just have to lean into them and figure out what they are and then you want to try and weave that into your YouTube channel somehow point of a 5 focus on quantity rather than quality it is far more important when you're starting out on YouTube to make a hundred really bad video Define make 10 really good videos of like putting in hundreds of hours of entertainment videos that's like a different style but like most people watching this your aim is to become a YouTuber that sort of like me where I buy you can say in front of a camera about whatever you want and it's kind of nice and you share your life and you share your experiences and you do some teaching rather than to kranti Netflix documentary quantity is more important than quality at the start and the teacher divides the group into two different groups one of the groups has to make a pot everyday for 30 days so by the end of the 30 days they make study pots what is the other group has to focus on a single pot for the Whole 30 days so they only have one part at the end of 30 days and then today's the teacher kind of brings all the parts together and judges the quality of the pots and he gives that prizes about who's the best place work and every single parts that won a prize came from the quantity group rather than the Quality Group especially when you getting started out in something earnings to be had improving your inability to talk to the camera improving your ability to edit videos improving of Storytelling all of these happen through quantity rather than through quality on this is that you just have to make a hundred videos make at least a hundred does and then worry about trying to improve the quality of them because by virtue of making a hundred videos you're naturally going to improve the quality of them without even really thinking about it but the main thing is you have to go to get in the rep it's all about called quantity rather than policy at this. number for is don't really worry about what your Niche is like people get hung up on this like I don't know what to make videos about it would be like a writer saying I don't know what to write about therefore I'm not going to write or like an artist thing I don't know what my mom going to be there for I'm not going to hold a paintbrush it's totally okay for your Niche to emerge overtime yes you can take a very calculating route and pulled out an advanced meal I paid this is my pot for you can do what I recommend which is just start making videos on YouTube about whatever you enjoy whatever you want talking on YouTube I wouldn't be worried about anything I just think you know what let me make videos about the things that I enjoy make maybe some close-up magic because I'm not a total loser maybe like iPhone maybe like you know my favorite pen maybe like you know if the bank started in YouTube maybe Life as a medical student maybe like what in my life that I enjoy talking about and I think I could teach on the internet that is the stuff I would stop making videos about and overtime as you stop making videos about things that you enjoy the audience starts to resonate with some of those things and so your Niche hands up emoji know the time I never thought I would be a productivity YouTuber but I seem to have become a productivity YouTuber because that needs just would have been most of the time it was not for planned in advance and so if you go to love interest if you go on YouTube just start making stuff and you will figure it don't be one of those righteous who says I don't know what my best out of book is going to be about that for a not going to write a single what is the same with you because we change of a time I started off making videos for medical school applicants I now and therefore it's changed over time so don't worry about it don't overthink it just make the videos that you enjoy as. 23b patience and be consistent those are really the only two things that you need to success on YouTube you need consistency and you need consistency in publishing at least one video week and patience and not worrying about the fact that you're not going to get any traction for a large amount of time 6s on YouTube is absolutely not an overnight thing and suddenly with my channel you know if you might my first like 80 videos I made no money and then I saw him $2 here and there and with all these things like it with every good thing in life it's like a compounding returns curve need to realize it when you're right at the start of the curb because you said you're not seeing any faction but three years later if you can stick with publishing two videos a week for three and a half years like I've been doing Anythink oh my God you know my first 200 videos they were just Paul about getting that flywheel 2-ton and ready it's all about that consistency but also having the patience and having the faith that this will pay off in the long run just not in the short-term it's like one of my goals for the New Year's to get six pack abs but if I were to do some crunches right now I do not see any apps coming out it would be a bit silly of me to say oh you know why am I not growing on YouTube but why am I coming up because you have to do it every day but several months before you see any results and that consistency to give you the ring rather than a super intense ab workout and a 1/2 is Troy think about it in terms of systems now this is a big thing that we can talk about the part-time Youth Academy again if you wanted the free 7-Day email clothes hit the link in the description but it's about building a system established that the way to grow on YouTube is by being consistent for a very long time you didn't want to start thinking okay if I need to be consistent and put out one or two videos a week for the next 5 years how can I build a system around that to make it easier for me to do an episode about YouTube careers what I did if you think one video at a time you think I came what's this week's video okay what's next week's video and then another one then very quickly realize that okay this is quite hard to sustain and so you want to think about building a system in terms of how can I generate as many ideas for continent and then number two how can I can I find these ideas and turn them into titles in thumbnails hooks I'm at 3 how can I serve create these videos and parallel limit for how can I find pockets of time throughout the day where maybe you know I've got a 10-minute break at work or in my lunch break where I can a video that's going to be pushed out several months in advance how can I plan on my content calendar so that I actually only have to film once and I can backfill maybe 5 videos in a row so that I don't have to go through the effort of setting up the lights in Cameron everything it's over this stuff around building a system book recommendation on that you should check out the e-myth Revisited by Michael Gerber this is a book I've been recommending to older students not course and everyone has read it says that oh my God this book is absolutely amazing it's just a great way of changing a mindset to thinking in terms of systems and that say that's one of the books that's most changed my life has made publishing on YouTube easier because now instead of thinking of it as one video at a time I think of it as a holistic cohesive coherence system thinking of getting started on YouTube then just do it you know you could literally posted video right now you can get your phone out you could just switch on the recording though the the camera turn on selfie mode on your phone and be like this is my first YouTube video I was watching tippling I started on YouTube video and he was saying to be honest you just kind of do it and so this is it I'm going to start my YouTube channel and this is video number one YouTube app on your phone it is that simple like we all overthink this so much like oh my God my first video has to be good and have to be in perfect and what are people going to think but we don't realize is that no one has no one's going to watch videos like who gives a like if it takes Channel 152 videos to go between 1000 and 10000 subscribers why do you think that video number one message it's just completely inconsequential baby number 2 3 4 5 6 21 what matters is that you actually just get started and the hitting that publish button on YouTube is not as hard as it originally seems and that's a quote that I like that yet the the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago the second best time is now and so if you're thinking all the time I wish I wish 10 years ago but if I don't have a channel and I was watching I'd watch to the end of this video I would just get my phone up and feel that video right now in fact if you doing that link it in the comments down below and I will I will subscribe to your channel and I'll be like your first subscriber for whatever that's worth. I just need you to upload that video and then commit the publishing at least one video awake so those were 10 tips on getting started on YouTube you really don't need anything else you just need to get started but if you're interested in joining me on a life-course where I teach a few hundred people about how to do the stuff with the assignments and things and everything we teach you about the systems-based approach to bring a pedal and check out the parts on YouTuber Academy Lincoln's video description along with my free 7-Day email course again length of video description do you need to go on YouTube no absolutely no it really is just about publishing content consistently and there is absolutely nothing Michael you can find out on the internet anyway check out the video greatest podcast check out the video craze YouTube channel check out think media there but a fantastic YouTube channel there so many free results online so if you don't that's fine you can do the work yourself but if you're the sort of person who benefits from accountability navigate community of people to go through the process with on top of the content that's all in one place I see pack it up for you and you might like to check out the course whatever happens once you start your YouTube channel you're going to need some tips of time management which is why you should check out that video where I talk through my top tips on managing your time so you can thank you so much and I'll see you in the next video"

That infected about 8,000 people and it killed about 800 people so how did 10% in 2012 there was another coronavirus epidemic caused by bmers the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome onset covid-19 is already affected a hundred thousand people look again confirm cases cases that we know of this building many more hundreds of thousands millions who we don't know how the disease but they carrying the virus without having been tested for it pretty love so only 3,500 people comparatively him. Compared to a hundred thousand. 3.5% and a 3.5% mortality from the NBC News website and I feed them guys and here we can see that you know it's just the vicious spread of covid-19 compared to these other diseases is just absolutely staggering so it for example we've hit a hundred thousand people with covid-19 in 50s days where is it took Sawyer's about 8 months to infect 800 people and in fact it took almost a whole year to infect the first 200 people so clingy covid-19 is spreading so much faster than these other previous expanded influenza the flu in facts about 40 million people a year and kills around 400,000 people a year worldwide that's an absolutely staggering number of people to die from just a normal flu and we just don't even bat an eyelid over that amount of death influenza virus so that's kind of why this whole coronavirus thing as a big deal it's a big deal because it spread really fast and it kills lot of people and even though 3.5% is very low compared to 3.5% of a few million people a lot of people and that's why this is such a big deal Okay cool so I get why this is a big deal but realistically you one of my chances of actually getting the coronavirus well it kind of depends on where you are breathing the same air as someone else you could at but for example if they were to cough on the surface and you have that dropped on the surface in touch with your hand the virus particle gets transferred out your hand and then when you suck your thumb because this is how it's transmitted in order to get the virus you actually have to come into recently close proximity with someone else who's got the virus and therefore if you're in the UK we've only got a hundred sixty three confirmed cases in the UK people with the caveat of course these are just be confirmed cases that's probably more than that running around the bars because he lived in a country where there are more people who have the disease or where the health system isn't quite equipped to deal with the disease so for example from the NHS website if you recently been to China or Cambodia Hong Kong it Ron Isley Japan last McCown Malaysia Myanmar Singapore but specifically only the h10 Costa adeje palace Hotel in Thailand and Vietnam unless I happen to have traveled recently or live in a country where people have already caught the disease but let's say for the sake of argument that I do kind of coronavirus what's going to do to me first and second what are the chances I'm going to survive Chipotle E coli covid-19 just yet for the sake of being technically correct and don't think about it second question about symptoms it's very similar to other sorts of respiratory viruses so things like the common cold and the flu that we talked about fever cough shortness of breath maybe some muscle aches and pains but the good news is that in about 80% of those cases the symptoms are going to be very mild affect you long too much but the World Health Organization estimates that for one and six people so about 15 cases that can actually cause potentially severe breathing difficulties in that would be. I do not know that for your chances of surviving covid-19 depend on whether affect your lungs and it also depends on how young you are and how medical problems you have us over we'll figure this a hundred 1587 confirm cases with the 3500 Ethel thereabouts and that leads us to an overall figure of 3.5% running with the virus and therefore we are under estimating the amount of people who are carrying the virus people like Professor England what was that number that's being bandied about let's have a look at this graph again from the NBC News website well done guys comparing covid-19 with saws and mowers as usual and as you can see from the graph your chances of increase significantly as you get older so people over 80 years old but even then and we also know that if you do have conditions like heart disease respiratory disease diabetes immune deficiency stuff like that then your chances of getting severely unwell or even dying from the virus I'll probably hire some even a lot higher than someone else who's young fit I'm finally it filled with mentioning that your chances of surviving covid-19 depend a lot on what country you're in and how good the healthcare system is so for example in the UK would you like mostly developed country with a pretty good National Health Service if for example me or my mom and my grandma would it catch covid-19 place on the healthcare system is probably set up well enough to be able to cope with it and therefore we would most likely survive I have time. Speaking to you soon on that front but for example if in Pakistan or Pakistan we don't have any money to access to healthcare system that then we would probably have a much higher chance of dying because the healthcare system do we have access to just isn't equipped to deal with this little stuff because I'm young fit healthy blah blah chances are I'm going to survive and I'll just got through my nose the relaxing end of each of those in ton is not fun like most people who have 2863 so far the way you fight to office that your body's immune system does the fighting for you so the most of us all body's immune system is pretty good at dealing with any kind of infectious pathogens of foreign bodies of bad things in the lungs in the body does a pretty good job of fighting it off it does take a bit of time people estimated would take about two weeks the problem is that because this virus affects the lungs and specially if your elderly and you call the medical problems it can interrupt your breathing and make it so difficult to breathe that you could potentially become really unwell or even die because of the breathing if before your body has a chance to fight off the virus but the good news is that even in that circumstance if a virus is in your lungs and causing breathing difficulties we can offer supportive treatment in hospital so the most legit version of this is that you would be helping with with a mechanical ventilator or system relation in intensive care and the idea that we can get this machine and this team of doctors and nurses around us to help us breathe and that gives about enough time to fight off infection naturally I before thee shortness of breath place where you don't have the sort of intensive care units and that sort of support it's a little harder to support your breathing cuz we don't really have many known fancy ways of doing that and so therefore your chances of dying from the disease a much higher Okay cool so Municipal that breathing until the disease of some kind of medication some kind of drug that we can give them right well we don't really have a cure yet we do have a load of all the drugs that we know what against other viruses and is only a big trial happen the world 7 China that training thousands of people on various antiviral drugs that we already know bug against some for us a bar says the Us and other countries are now just starting out the Run Charles as well there's a few drug that we think might have some promise so does a drug called truck which is a combination of two anti-hiv drug and HIV is a virus and we have medications are pretty good against HIV so we're hoping maybe some of those can work against the coronavirus severe which they tried in 2013 and 2016 West African we're hoping that that might have some efficacy against the coronavirus and some Chinese do to the drug called chloroquine good news for low-income countries because chloroquine is very cheap drug and therefore it can be given to a problem imma get that my own chances of catching front of ours are pretty low because I'm in the UK and I haven't been in contact with people Pinocchio and has no vaccine is that right so far has really good phrases been going around social media recently which is #anxious you should stay alert but we shouldn't be too anxious about what's going on but to be honest I can see why people worried especially if you ain't one of these countries where there's been confirmed during one of these countries by the healthcare system isn't quite designed to cope with a potential outbreak of something like the coronavirus especially if you or your loved ones are elderly or you got medical problems like I can completely understand why this would be a source of anxiety but if it's any consolation we should remember that there all these other diseases that kill so many more people than a year diseases like malaria and TB that are still killing millions of people every year and again no one is really panicking too much about those kind of things went away for what it's worth remembering that 80% of people problems with remembering that the whole world is not fighting this thing so you know about Collective bring together hopefully we can come up with something to help figure out what's going on and help get Humanity through this potential prices protect ourselves against getting the disease and also if we do have the bars to prevent spreading it to others so first date we can do simple things like if we cook or sneeze or we can wash my hands Unforgettable when we get into work or we arrived home we can wash our hands again just washing my hands a bit more regularly than we normally do does help reduce the transmission of the heavy droplets that contain the virus in them touching your face which is good advice in general because you don't want to get you over the fragile skin on your face destroyed by the stuff when you have but the idea is that because you're more likely to catch the antenna to get the virus do plates on your hands and therefore if you touch your face then. alarm service area bordering that realistically I find it very hard to avoid touching my face touch my face so I'm going to go by the hand-washing route to try and minimize the risk of catching especially when I'm at work in the hospital and perhaps more importantly if you think that you might have covid-19 are Hugo symptoms of a cold / flu breath cough muscle aches that sort of thing and you been in contact with someone who's confirmed to have the disease then there is a chance that you might have it and you should follow your own country's advice on how will I get to work to do in that situation in the UK for example it's great because we put the because the National Health Services 111 coronavirus helpline to the telephone survey that you bring up and you say hey I recognize the coronavirus and they ask you questions and I tell you exactly what to do and actually now outside recipe every hospital will they put these covid-19 the coronavirus put things which is why you go in and you can get swabbed and then they can test the swab results to see if you've actually got coronavirus but the idea is that you go to these things separately so that you're not walking into a hospital that's gold each other and said you are being isolation so that if you do end up having the disease you can self isolate and self isolate means that you don't go to work it out there school you attended public places for about 2 weeks and they think so far as to make taking a breathing when you come into Hospital in to a specialist infectious diseases words that have the whole kind of airflow in quarantine systems know what stuff set up so that we can support your breathing while your body fight the infection but that's what happened what happened show that if you think you might have coronavirus in your country just Google it feel country and I'm sure you'll find something on some of the tit website that give you some advice about what to do in that circumstance okay cool should I get a face mask Yelp Fresno you should be wearing a face mask for a few reasons so Presley the World Health Organization has said that there is a global shortage of Facebook so that's one play evidence of face masks work where it is absolutely no evidence that face masks work for protecting you if you're just a member of the general public and about your business and it doesn't have any medical benefits most people remember guys going to be a little anxious # in some ways this is an absolutely amazing time in history because it's really interesting virus going around at a time where we are more connected like as a human race than we've ever been before like this all this drama about China and how the first few cases. how that happened in this some talk that maybe the government was trying to cover stuff up but there's a lot of stuff about how China actually combating the price is really well and building a hospital and building 10 days and stuff so already we seen Global stock markets take a bit of a dive in response to the crisis major events cancelled we seen flights to whole countries is stopped because of the epidemic on the side of it which seems to be a battle between the the ground struggling to get information out by social media for the rest of the world and the Chinese government run a sensored on ready come down with censorship which is all very interesting mass panic about the potential pandemic is probably more damaging than the potential pandemic itself and of course on the side we go to different countries have to try and discover a cure try and find it back so cool from like an academic medical social economic perspective important to remember that this is a real disease that is affecting real people all around the world whether we can see them or not the situation is constantly evolving short things could become a lot more serious and they are now but we should remember that regardless of what goes on it's always better to be alert not anxious there is stuff that we can do to help reduce it spread like what these are on the fact that we would need to come into contact with someone to actually have it on the following appropriate procedures if we think we might have the disease so yeah that was a uncommon screw a suggestion anything like that please dudeism the comment down below I want to say the oldest information is as far as I know accurate as of the 6th of March 2020 in the evening UK time and I've done my best trying to research it based on various official resources like website WK the CDC website Who website and the New England Journal of Medicine oldies original like research papers on it thank you so much for watching"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him intimately I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and today we're kicking off a brand new series on this channel called how to survive medical school and this is going to end up being a series of at least 20 videos animated video me and various of my friends were repeat the last few months are going to be giving you guys advice on how to survive various bits of medical school so we're going to be doing videos on things like learning on the wards how do we do a little skis how to write essays how to get Publications work-life balance pet resources how to take note to self but in this video I'm going to be sharing very I wish I knew as a first-year medical student and we're going to be focusing more on like the study side of things and like coping with the workload as opposed to the social side to be honest the social side kind of takes care of itself and I've done another video with my friend because we talked about tips for freshers like you know how to make stop button this video already want to focus on the specifics of kind of advice that will hopefully help you when it comes to the workload of your first year of medical school and 10 of them to go into like a 10 tips thing that's what's going to be the time stamps in the description below if you want to skip around UConn if you don't want to watch this whole videos in one go you don't have to and might end up being quite long and roundly but this is a topic that I can literally go in about 4 hours and hours so I'm spending these up into these ten bits just to give some start this video because everyone loves a well-structured video so that's just wanted to say is that every medical school is different and as much as we might like to think that medicine is all the same everywhere and it's like a standardized thing it's really not every medical school does the syllabus in the runway so I'm probably not the right person to be giving you very specific advice on what the best resources are for example that's been a really common question Instagram you know what textbook would you recommend for x and that kind of. your p**** is like so at Cambridge for example we have to write essays in a physiology exam about the structure and function and the discovery of the sodium pump where is here if you're ready for medical school they might not care about you know how the sodium pump was first discovered in the making you write a five-page essay about it instead so you know the sort of textbooks and results that you'd be using to write about the sodium pump while going to be different depending on where the closest like it's probably the single biggest if I can get for you is to make friends with people in years above you of this is not like being back in Secondary School and secondary school when you go in and you're 7 you are literally the bottom of the end of the totem pole I don't know the prices are going to sing the too cool for you and then I want to be your friend because you're like Lilia 7 but that completely changes when you get University specifically when you get medical school as a first-year in a way you have the highest Social Capital that you ever will and the second years are going to want to be friends with you the feds are going to want to be friends with you the full tears are going to feel a bit weird about wanting to be friends with you but they'll still want to be friends with you regardless so don't think that these guys are older than you and cool can you call an approach them people will absolutely love it if you go up to them and say hey look you know your second day of your third year under under the first year I'm looking for advice can you help me what are your favorite resources can you share some of your notes with me what advice do you have for XYZ make friends with your seniors they will really really help you they've been through the system they've been through exactly the same course they can give you all the resources that they have and that's one of the things that made my own personal experience medical school a lot easier because I made friends with people in years above through societies and Truman College also kind and happy to share notes of me and that is something I've continued on full people in the air blow me or I phone number to is begin with the exam in mind that this might sound weird to say I don't like when you get into Medical School you sort of think that the ways to become a good doctor first year the objective is really not to become a good doctor becoming a good doctor is Nina 566 + years down the line when you're in your first year in the vast majority of medical degrees you're focused on learning the basic Sciences you focus on understanding focused on doing as well as you can in the exam ideally without you know working yourself into a mental breakdown or equivalent so we don't want to be thinking oh I wonder if this will help my clinical practice 6 years from now we want to be thinking how do I most efficiently revise for the exam that have died end of the year without allowing my life to get continue destroyed and to the end would you need to keep the exam in mind so pretty much the earlier you can start having a look at the past papers that you're going to get the better it'll be for you because especially like you know that's something I cannot to me for example if you get a big enough to me textbook like Grey's Anatomy of clinically oriented Anatomy whatever just so much stuff in there and there is no way they're going to be testing you on all of it and I know people love the idea of working from textbooks I'm going to talk more about that in Lake Point you know if you know what sort of questions are going to ask during your exam you can tailor your learning of the subject and your revision of the subject of two words that sort of thing and like everyone is going to get to a reasonable Baseline standard anyway and to be honest by next year and after you're going to forget the vast majority of them out to me that you memorize for the first year exam anyway but you know the more efficient you can be the more efficient you can be at preparing yourself specifically for the victims are going to get the more out of the easier you will find it to go through medical school and he won't be bogged down by pages and pages of textbooks where the bus majority of it is not going to be examined thoroughly having just said that you keep the exam in mind I want to employ you to try and understand the big picture of your subject and to not focus or obsessed too much about the details does a good quote that I came across some you know some websites saying that you never lying on memorization is a recipe for disaster or what's the effect you do not want to be relying on memorizing the fats you want to be relying on understanding the general concept an evening something like that to me in Pharmacology words you know it might seem at first glance like a list of facts that you have to learn even though subject there is still a lot of understanding East. Based around it for me to determine whether I understand something lost myself would I be able to explain this to a five-year-old and I think this is something to do would like the Feynman technique Richard Feynman supposedly used to do something like that but I'll be able to explain this to a five-year-old you know do I really understand how kind of the brachial plexus work can I diagram explaining in very very simple words in a way that a five-year-old would understand this if you do things that I kind of picked up for a medical school that I would I would recommend people might like to try just a test to test your understanding of stuff one of them is Austin yourself the question is that right so let's say you come across I don't ask me about inflammation in Authority for the first time or you're learning about HIV with an immunology and then you know you find that HIV reduces your CD4 count this is bad because if I have less or other fewer CD4 plus cells then I will not be able to mount an immune response why is that bad that is bad because the next time I get an infection is going to kill me because I won't be able to respond to back of my mind you know why is this bad because it really helps me Focus down on exactly in actually understanding what's going on so I can leave one thing I like to ask myself is how pissed off would I be if I go this particular disease let's primary sclerosing cholangitis and you know I've never seen it in real life because you know I'm still pre-clinical medical student and I'm learning it because you know it's not to be anatomy of the Bitterroot Resort irrelevant and I know that if I mention Primary sclerosing cholangitis in my essay I look at me at first because the ad clinical in Blair that's inside a textbook or until you know any kind of revision guide you're doing really appreciate weather or diseases in at like really really really bad or if it's just like it's it'll be annoying to have but it's not fake or oh you know it's just like having a bit of a you know a bit of a to take for a day and it's kind of annoying for a day but then it goes away and again something that I think helps helps understanding various disease processes okay phone number for I would highly recommend building an active recall and spaced repetition into your study routine from day one if you haven't seen my videos about space reputation the back to Regal please watch those when I first learned about those in my second year of study medicine Loyola my friend that we came across that total for the first time in a lecture it completely blew our minds and we were thinking why has no one ever told us about how to study efficiently this active repo thing in the space rotation thing is absolutely incredible I wish I'd known about it 10 years ago I just spoke with you Jesus he's an a-level infest your medicine so please like if you haven't seen those videos please watch them basically in those videos I say that rereading highlighting and taking notes controversially all quite ineffective inefficient revision strategies no / me / you know to study this and looked at all of the various research papers done on University students like yourself about you know how they memorize and understand and learn stuff and they found these two techniques spaced repetition and active recall are by far the best how do you use after recall I'm I get this message let you know what specific tactics do you use for at the Regal I told you about a few of them in that I can recall video without link up there down there and everywhere information from your brain the more that information is going to get encoded of the more you will retain it I'm going to be able to recall that later today we should not be thinking of recalling of retrieving and testing ourselves as something that we just doing the exam we should be thinking of testing ourselves as being probably the most crucial component of learning to begin with so I can expect repetition again to talk about more about that in the actual video about spaced repetition but essentially you know if you if you've done a topic write down the date that you that you've got done the topic and then it again in three days time with you again a week later and then two weeks later and suddenly by the end of the term you'll find that you're actually retaining a lot of this information where is a lot of you or your friends or colleagues who have not been using spaced repetition or going to get to the end of the time and realize oh wow I've already forgotten everything about the Upper Limb that we learned in week 1 and 2 in and out to me and I just about remember the stuff we just covered so that's one of those things that you know the more you can use spaced repetition in the more disciplined you can be with yourself about actively using spaced repetition the more efficient your life will become it's just an absolute incredible technique the research says it and literally everyone I know who uses it swears by it and said that the best thing ever in addition doctor Rico okay phone number five please you will really be glad if you do just a little bit of working just a little bit of work even just 20 minutes of work each day is better than nothing and actually 20 minutes of work each day is infinitely better than nothing we can all find 20 minutes in a day to just do a little bit of work to review some of the practice questions that we work for ourselves because practicing I do recall even if you know you can't be bothered without the recall because it takes little brainpower even spending 20 minutes just pre-reading for you Alexis the next day is really really going to help in my experience like the two biggest categories of people that struggling a lot through medical school is first late people unfortunately with a history of mental health problems who you know find that the atmosphere of medical school exacerbates the issues that they have already and there's really much I can offer about that either through but what I can offer advice to is that second category of people the ones who really struggle when it comes to take them to him because they have literally done zero work the whole year to was exam season last year I started getting messages on Instagram from people saying how to repost spreadsheet to crumb learning all of anatomy into two weeks because I haven't done any work throughout the year and then like yeah you can even try but if you spend a whole year not doing anything you've completely hamstrung yourself on the way spaced repetition station 19 20 minutes a day consistently is going to be so much better than cramming for the exam because that's about it you know we will know it and retrieval Space Station spelling things out of all over long. Of time is by far the better way of retaining information so if you can just get yourself into the habit of just doing a little bit of work each day your life will be so so much easier because of it from people saying how much work should I do each day doing an hour a day pretty good but again it's not really about the time it's about how efficient it is and you know if you if you this would a person that busted bust out there again I'm big ass Grey's Anatomy original first edition textbook and starts highlighting and cooking out making notes from it it may take you 5 hours to do what else might do in 20 minutes using a website Wikipedia and Anki flashcards it's not really about how many hours you put in as much as that narrative is ready, especially amongst our parents specially if you're from like India and Pakistan in like the subcontinent oh you know but you know in Orlando Medical School Professor tell us we have to be pouring over all textbooks for like 8 hours a day and that's just like really not an efficient way of doing it what was I saying yeah just do a little bit of work each day it doesn't matter how much as long as you can do it consistently the more fish you can be without using special position I can recall the better your life will be in the long run a lot of you are going to be using Anki flashcards Quizlet World episode of flash card apps even physical flashcards people still use those in a few one of the biggest mistakes you can make messages about this already is you're probably making too many flashcards especially right at the start where you don't yet have this big picture understanding of what Anatomy is in what physiology isn't how the lungs work especially in the early on and when you haven't looked at your exam papers the Temptation is going to be there to write down every single detail from Alexis from your slides from your books and turn it into flashcards because you thinking that's my 245 Cardinal scripture that says I want to go 8 Tropico hang on that's about 3,000 cards just for physiology way too many in fact I'd probably recommend avoiding making flashcards at least for the first few weeks until you have a better Kia of how how everything kind of fits together like when I saw a clinical medicine in my fourth year I decided I was going to memorize the Oxford Handbook of clinical medicine with you somewhere because I wasn't because I didn't take the time to get a big picture meaning of what was going on in clinical medicine I decided to stop by memorizing the details of henoch schonlein purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome where to send me nice things that I just like not that common and absolutely not the first thing that clinical medical student letting when I didn't yet know what a Hasa type was or like how to deal with COPD or how to deal with atrial fibrillation and like the reading reading Kumon books on the stuff so this is a trap that so many people fall into it's by far the biggest complaint of any sort of Anarchy based discussion I've got too many class flashcards I'm feeling overwhelmed I don't know what to do so my advice would be tone down the number flashcards you make I'll put a few things in the in the description below to some websites that have some really good advice about donkey and I'm going to be doing a much more specific video exactly how I'd recommend using antifa medical school but yeah if you using Anki flashcards and you feeling overwhelmed take a step back and understand the big picture don't worry about making flashcards by every little detail right I think I lost count free reading for lectures is incredibly useful and almost almost never done thing that you can do like the next day it's it's kind of hard if you have like 10 lucky we only ever had like three types of the day tops most days only had two Sundays even had one it's pretty doable to spend you know you're 20 minutes of work that the other day before is reading over the lecture notes reading over the slides or if you don't have to lecture notes of the slides but you know what topping to be talking about I have a breeze through the topic on Wikipedia or Google does no need to bust out your big in a pathology textbook just have an open Wikipedia see what the general principles what the kind of chapter headings of that topic would be brought them down somewhere and just doing that will give you lots more out of going to the lecture I'll be honest when I was in first year I used to attend lectures for the purposes of sleeping I thought it easier to sleep in lectures and I did in my own bed so I go to the lecture and I just kind of find myself dozing and there was nothing I could do to stop it I used to get my college friends like poke me in the side sweet potato cheese to get into poke me decide to wake me up then I'm kind of like do this and everyone we kind of look around me and smile because it's like everyone you was going on and if you look around electrical you'll see about half of it either sleeping or in a watching the football in their MacBook 11 but I found that on the fuel X's where I did manage to pre-read and I did this a lot more in second year in a lot more than 30 random and Beyond what I managed to pre-read the lectures I understood it so much more was able to take more and I was able to engage mower with the lecture and my notes were even better quality so if you can do it then please. For elections it will change your life if you can do it consistently textbooks all massively overrated I know this is very controversial advice because we as medical students absolutely love the fact we absolutely love the fact that we can either get this big big textbook and it feels really heavy and we love sticking in front of us and like flicking food it isn't like highlighting bits and thinking you know what I'm a medical student because I've got this big textbook and that is how medical student should be and that you know everything in the world is good because of textbooks on massively overrated text books are sort of good if you are looking through them with the with the intention of finding out specific bits of information over the intention to understanding a particular topic and then you should close the book and just forget about it and never opened again because the problem is that they encourage a a very linear way of looking at things they encourage you to start from chapter 1 and then go to chapter 84 and stuff like that fashion medicine isn't really organized in that fashion textbooks also encourage you to think that you have to learn all this information especially if your medical school teachers or whatever are telling you that oh hey you know all recommended reading is vote vote and Pratt principles of biochemistry which is like a thousand page textbook where are you know to be honest everything in the exam is going to come from the lecture notes anyway so technically overrated I would recommend actually using resources like Wikipedia using Google to find out information you know that's how you want to find out the nerve supply to the biceps brachii you can just Google it and find out Wikipedia or let's say you want to try and memorize understand the function of all the muscles of the Upper Limb funny YouTube video about it it's good website don't open up your Grey's Anatomy or you're clinically oriented Anatomy unless you looking for like a specific thing that is going to help you on this will help your essays or whatever become a little bit better and I wish that someone told me this when I was in my first year because in my first year I really glamorized is idea of textbooks my mom is a doctor and she's from the generation that will so massively glamorize at the audio textbooks principles of physiology and to be honest it's a good book and it does help for understanding but my mom theory was that look you know every day just read five pages of Guyton and if you read 5 pages of brighten the day by the end of the year you'll know all the physiology but that's just not how it works like reading from a textbook all the evidence says that how we retain information is spaced repetition inactive Regal and I think that none of this culture of relying on big to heavy textbooks and even worse just culture of thinking that we are doing something good by relying on big heavy textbooks is counterproductive some people but if you're finding that you're getting overwhelmed with textbooks then I'd suggest put them away. Open them again use the internet use out of these mini revision guides yeah those will serve you a lot better than medical textbooks will at least that's what I found that's what the vast majority of my friends found but now speaking of evolved what resources would you recommend what textbooks would you recommend I would not recommend a single textbook good in terms of understanding video but to be honest all that stuff you can get from osmosis videos on YouTube the very good or just like random videos on YouTube or just Wikipedia Google or whatever you don't need to text books East but you especially don't need to buy a textbook because of the vast majority of medical schools in the world will have libraries where you have to stack and if you are more inventive reminded you might want to animal testing this but you might type in the name of the textbook and type in free PDF on Google and you find a PDF that if you wanted to and if you were so inclined you can just download onto your iPod and interview the textbook if you need anything then you can find specific stuff that you looking for a while then trying to go in the index and whatever what resources would I recommend me for not to me number one is instant and that's me. This is the website that's created Bible going to be something at Cambridge it's actually really good and the reason why I think it's good just because it's simplifies Anatomy the problem was Grey's Anatomy on the textbooks is that you get very complicated diagrams where is in Cincinnati website the podcast and stuff he drew his own kind of like hand-drawn diagrams which I'm not overly complicated and done in a survey that helps you understand what the anatomy is like because you really can't see it in a in a property tax bill would like proper accurate diagram it's enough to be able to really good for finding the general rules of anatomy And what I mean by that I mean that it's a general rule that all the muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm was supplied by the radial nerve and this is not something that you would typically see in a text book instead biggest able to hold the muscles in the arm and some of them in the poster and you'll see it come next to them radial nerve or interosseous pain to the right and left like no one would actively tell you that actually you know you did. Don't have any of those all you have to remember is that old wonderful world of the muscles in the compartment of the arm * the median of wonderful with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris on another one that I can remember so you know these rules and exceptions I like all of them all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx by the recurrent laryngeal nerve with the exception of cricopharyngeus which is Supply supplied by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve or something like that but you know repeated over and over and over special edition has stuck in my head and I find that now that I'm an actual dog to I forgotten the vast majority but not to me but the stuff that I remember is the stuff that I used to have these rules about you know old infant muscles of the hand is supplied by the owner with the exception of loaf lateral lumbricals opponens pollicis abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis which of the Bible the meaning of me and website into Anatomy buddy helps with that and there's a casino in the morning for brachial plexus mnemonic for the branches of the external carotid artery all this other stuff is already very good but having said that Anki flashcards in general are absolute incredibly useful for anatomy anatomy is kind of seeing flexor carpi radialis and knowing what the butterflies and what the weather no suppliers and that's the sort of thing that flashcards just has completely changed the game if you can use flash cards without to reactivate cult by definition the flash cards on spaced repetition with stuff like and he have built into them buddy. Let's say you know you didn't know that with the me to know if you would click it was hard and they would come up again in a few minutes time and let's say you didn't notice the median of he's going to come up in a few days time so this stuff like I'm he is just really helpful for not being credible news websites like instant not to me I'm just random bits on Google and Wikipedia and stuff to learn the general rules and exceptions of anatomy And once you've done that start memorizing the code of nitty-gritty details and a flashcard app like I'm Keith absolutely perfect. I would not recommend any textbooks clinically oriented Anatomy is all right I sort of used a bit in Minot to me write essays about you know how bones grow or about unit structure of the Upper Limb or jalapeno the hip joint makes it ideal for weight-bearing textbook Saturday pointless if your exam is multiple choice and key and Anatomy would be my personal recommendations as medical students on a doctor's we have to learn a list of a ton of drugs and by far the best way of doing that is by using Anki Anki is amazing in my second year we have pharmacology and me and two of my housemates, and pulled I thought making an an-ki deck of all of the drugs that we needed to know and as we would go through the lectures I would just add the drugs that we came across to this Anki deck once a week or so we would all get an order from a city Kabob chicken Doner with me and chips with a boy mayonnaise and kind of guys on chicken wrap and pull the puppy just cooking noodles at home because she was already found out about anyway so we can stay in my room and we and by the time and time came around we already learned all of the drugs and use them back of our hands we would see her phone him instantly know exactly what is mechanism of action wasn't exactly what it was used for and that was that felt like a superpower that you know just by putting in about an hour a week working together it's fun you're having Kabob it's okay it's a good time Bethel Music in the background I just passing through drugs really enjoyable it's like one of the fundamentals I've got a medical school doing these drugs without common pool that sounds weird but yeah it's fun it's fashion in to take an hour a week and I'm key is by far the best way of learning Farm again don't worry about textbook sell activate if you if you do want to book the the book a medical pharmacology at a glance is like this thick it's like tiny and its really really good that was what I used to get first houses in my phone college essays and it's just I don't know the diagrams and just passed them into my essay anti-transgender Lionel to the Cambridge essays are big plus so good yeah if you do want a book is collected otherwise antifa pharmacology School makes you learn so like I said we have to do stuff about sodium pump and we had to learn the Krebs cycle some people don't have to learn the Krebs cycle but regardless by chemistry. Dog runs over and over again it's like it's sort of like a little chemistry where you had this reaction mechanisms of electrophilic addition and uniquely substitutional that stuff I'm just throwing out the dog ran over and over again isn't like a really good way of getting good at those for physiology like I said but to be honest explanations for stuff you can find on Wikipedia anything about physiology is to be able to explain the concept of to a five-year-old and an endorphin with physiology it's just a case of flowcharts so you know let's say you're talking about how the buffer system in the blood Works in an in an essay about kidneys or just trying to understand how the kidneys work you can say that okay let's say you add 10 H+ ions into your blood then you know next step that dissociates unit 2H + 803 - whatever that and then you get a little bit of a shift in the kidneys and then you got the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system doing this and then you get real this from the tubules and it's it's like a very sore the stepwise process I forgot to know my kidney physiology flowchart based and the more you can explain it in very simple words to 5 the better you'll do nothing like the foliage is the other big topic that you get in first and second-year the key for pathology ready is a to understand the general concepts the principles of information the principles of the immune system or the laundry defense all that stuff but then again using a mixture rules so for example with the follow J you probably have to learn the classification of the different types of bacteria one way of doing that is by saying that everything is a gram-negative Rod unless it's not okay fine what are the ones that aren't . for strep if it's a gram-negative Percocet even neisseria or Maricela if it's a gram-positive Rod it is going to be ABCD or Elsa actinomyces bacillus anthracis of bacillus cereus c4d for Coronavirus Syria and Alpha listeria and then everything else is a gram-negative Road and suddenly you've done to the gram classification of every single bacteria you can imagine without having to memorize all of it because you've worked out the system in this sort of Internet you know you've just got some kind of system rules and give you the exception to the rule being everything is gram-negative rods the exceptions being except these 8 things which is a lot easier to learn than you know the list of a hundred bacteria once you've understood it and once you go as much as you can out of the rules in the exceptions wanted to be learning the specific that again and he is just in a cause of its own for letting the specific stuff like that learning what aisle 1 in to look into into the can 517 do learning what like all the different media to do learning what type of viruses Noah togavirus and a flavivirus Anna Paquin of Arsenal that stuff all that stuff the big one is too much information but those be my recommended resources are ability of a list and I'll do a more detailed about this where I've interviewed lot of my other friends about what they would recommend and if you then recommend textbooks but for the most part people generally say that you don't really need textbooks General Vibe I've gone from one of my friends is that we will boatload the textbooks back in the day cuz we will he know to be good medical I hope it's been useful so far but attend the final bit the bit that we going to use to end this video is please work together medicine is not a competition you might have pulled over as a competition for getting into medical school because it'll like competitive and stuff even like she was going to anyway please work together in a fun friends find colleagues work together sharenotes share resources help each other out there is absolutely nothing for you to gain from trying to you know withhold information from you from you from your friends from giving a college from people in your like yeah so if you think about it far enough that if someone else does it better than you then that means you less likely to get a first solo but I think that's a very that's very in it like a sub-optimal way of way of approaching this whole medical school thing because it really doesn't matter what sort of grades you got especially when you were first and second gear like literally no one cares that you go first and last me know that you didn't get it fast enough to me like I think of how little you about your history grade right now and that's kind of the position that I'm now in looking back at my first-year medical student self and thinking why did I why do I care so much about getting the extra marking anatomy And if you the soda that cares so much about getting those extra marks in and out to me that you tried to screw over your friends in the process of doing so then in a nice place to be to live your life time together you then use for the person who will form happy memories of you and your friends working together you'll be friends for life and you'll think of medical school as a much more fun and engaging and pleasant experience than if you had this very assertive attitude mindset thinking that it's you against everyone else and you were out to beat them because really you know we're going to be talked to nobody cares how you doing your exams go together make friends be happy have a good time also know that you know your medical school for most people between the ages of like 18 and 24 which are some of you know you the prime years of your life they say the university is supposed to be the best time of your life like if you if you just like work together and your friendly and warm and nice to people and you know dick and you don't mean and you don't transfer people I just like to treat it as a disorder treated as a game you roll into the game together Euro you have backing against the exams together you will have an infinitely better time than if you treat medical school as a competitive exercise in getting to the top Isabel for the notes that was all says share those results with people you know it's just the best way forward so thank you so much for watching already had this been useful stay tuned for the other 19 + videos in the series called how to survive medical school where me look my friends are going to be giving you advice on how to do various things like how to get Publications how to do an essay how to revise to ask how to revise written exams how to make notes I spent the last six months kind of getting people into my room while I was still a medical student in my final year and asking them all of these various questions we've got a ton of fitted I just need to get around Hoops I just need to get Ron to editing into a series of that was useful if your first you medical student or any sort of medical students watching this then I'm kind of jealous because you are at the store of what is an absolutely incredible experience of a product has the potential to be an absolutely incredible experience provided you know you manage to get through the exams without destroying itself and provided work together and be nice and Davido and stuff so you can cuddle position and have a great time my medical Bay medical student is hard work but it's also a lot of fun and when you're in my position Virginia DOC Tony looking back on that time you want to be thinking in a while I'm really glad I spent those six years in medical school I had a wonderful time and I'm a great friends and I learned a lot and that is a little of Praise the Lord the position that I'm in at the moment so you already beautiful she like to please give a thumbs up if you haven't have a lovely day and I will see you in the next video goodbye"

            "text": " this video is sponsored by skillshare check out the link in the description to get your 2 month free trial STI NC four most important principles when it comes to studying or learning anything effectively and efficiently test stands for spacing Tifa testing interleaving and see for categorizing and if you can apply these four principal still studying is going to become a lot more efficient based on the way 100 studies that have been done on students all over the world the first two spacing and testing are probably the most important ones and then I'll be talking about two other Concepts into leaving and categorizing that I haven't really spent much time on this channel discussing biggest is basically like 5 learning packs that supported rigorously by research and three of them that I focus on that chapter are arresting spacing and interleaving of a book called The Sports Gene which is all about the signs of extraordinary athletic ability and he's got a new soon in the UK cold range which is about how generous Triumph in a world of specialist apparently I've pre-ordered it on Kindle come with Rita and researching these two books he's looked a lot of the evidence behind effective learning techniques both for studying for exams and stuff but also for things like sports concludes much like the office of make it stick which is another really good book that every student should read he concludes that spacing testing and integrating all the real game changes so I'm going to talk about each of these components tsci because I think that's the order testing for me as a hierarchy of importance but it makes for a less good Alice nice nice demonic sir tsci the order in which let's get started recall retrieval practice with basically just means testing yourself but they called active recall in the scientific research papers but honestly I think it's confusing I've had so many messages from students being like how to apply active recall to this and what what does that mean for that you don't it's just testing testing yourself is the single most important thing you can do to boost her exam scores by a ridiculous amount in the book make it stick which again you should read and I'll put it down in the description below the oldest comment that most often when students come to them asking for tips about a not happy with their exam results the simple answer is that they just not testing themselves enough and it's hard to overstate the importance of this video show that just testing yourself once is a lot better than rereading the same thing four times and it's really how much of us think that re-reading our notes or reading the textbook or highlighting or even taking notes is a useful way to study when it's really not all of the evidence shows that the more you test yourself the more information is likely to stick the, subjection whenever I preached this idea of you should self you should try and retrieve stop people often say that how do I test myself if I don't know the stuff already like actually have to learn the content first before I can test myself on it on my own stuff that is firstly you should check out my video Call of how to learn new content in which I'd give a 12 minute long explanation about this main point is out of said that testing yourself is integral to actually learning in first place in fact testing yourself is so important that you should be testing yourself even before you learn a topic for the first time and here is David Epstein talking about texting is wonderful for learning cancel study because of primes your brain for when you done here in answer to retain it even if you get some extra specially to get stuff wrong so they call the hypercorrection effect with your quite confident about an answer and turns out you're wrong you're more likely to remember the right one when you get it self before during and after studying a topic is probably the single best way to actually learn the topic so I could go on about this for hours and I have done in my other videos three-quarter inch spacing spacing or leave space between the practice of the same thing something over and over and over in one session you'll see progress right away but you really care about is how long does it stay as David says spaced repetition is the idea that you're spacing out your study sessions such that you had a chance to forget some of the information before you then reset it and hope restarting it we mean testing a cell phone that information and this relates to a phenomenon in memory research that's been around since the eighteen-hundreds cold this forgetting curve and forgetting it's only time our memory just to decays so we will approach experience where I went in a lecture we like we think we learned something we we think we're going to start something and then we look back at it a day or week or month later, like crap where did all that information go on a fact since I seem to become one of these study tips I getting onto the internet one of the most where is Olga Instagram DM is along the lines of I'm in class I made my notes and I've studied and I think I get it and then I'll just forget it the next day and I don't know what that is and I think I must be really bad because all my clothes might seem to be getting it immediately the first time the answer to that is no you're not bad because this is literally how memory works supposed to forget stuff over time I'm sure retrieve the information in re-encode it and make it stick and your classmates are not getting it first time unless they're the one of those 0.0001 percent of people who have a genuinely photographic memory they are also having to put in Malta Pete Sessions of learning to actually learn something there is no such thing as someone who just got their first time around the forgetting curve literally fast everyone so don't worry if you find yourself getting stuff in this video the best way to get this information to stick in a long time especially again to read the book make it stick single spacing testing into leaving and categorizing and he was David Epstein again there was one study one famous study where two groups of people learning Spanish vocabulary 1 group got like 8 hours intensive on one day the other group got 4 hours one day the other four hours a month later babe daddy exact same studying one was just separated by month 8 years later they brought them back in the group that had the spaced practice intervals remembered 250% more with no studying and so you have a certain amount you want to study it becomes more efficient if you space it out you take time of deliberately not practicing so this way you told me about it's clearly an extreme case but you see pretty much identical results reported across the entire literature on effective studying recessions is much much more efficient and trying to do everything all in one go otherwise known as crying if you want to know more about spacing you can check out my 26-minute video All About spaced repetition and the evidence behind it and in that video on going to some details about how you can apply to run but if you don't care about the evidence and you just want a very quick method that you can immediately apply from today you can check out my video about the retrospective revision timetable which is one of my favorite techniques for ensuring that I'm using active recalls face and spaced repetition or other spacing and testing to make moist efficient as possible which means I can then do other things in my spare time like to make videos like this is one of my personal favorite efficient study techniques I'm working on a proper long video about this where I Philly talk about some of the a general overview the main point is that if we wanted information it's far better for us to try and build a categorization system for that information from build a structure around it rather than just trying to learn information which is probably the deal Prodigy. Studies in the literature web are they get two groups of students one group of students just gets told to memorize a list of words and the other groups of students get some kind of categorization system in place for those words or gets told to create their own categorizations lump certain words into different categories and in the vast majority of these studies you find that the second group decategorization group completely destroys the first group in terms of the amount that information sticks both in the short-term and long-term that one way to think about this is to build what I liked tree of knowledge around our subject around the topic and that is starting with a like a main trunk and then building a branches off at such that anytime we get any new piece of information were able to hang it on one of the branches of our tree I'll give you an example from medical school I used to find the topic of hematology which is the study of the blood quite overwhelming cuz there's so much various things that can go wrong with a blood but then one day I sat down beside you know what I'm just going to build a tree of knowledge I didn't call it then but that's kind of what I was thinking build my tree of knowledge about hematology and I realize that looking through the specification looking through the syllabus looking through a few textbooks and online resources that everything within hematology can pretty much be categorized into three things problems with anemia I ate your hemoglobin and sadly the cancer malignant hematology stuff within those we go around subcategories so we can anemia we've got microcytic anemia normocytic anemia macrocytic anemia and things that make you cook versus things that make you bleed malignant hematology we go for things we've got the lymphomas we got leukemia as we've got the myeloproliferative disorders we put the plasma cell dyscrasia has and a few other things I'm creating my tree of knowledge and I found that since creating the tree of knowledge for hematology the subject a lot better because now when I come across I don't know Bolden storms macroglobulinemia I know exactly where it fits on my little brunch thing I want to come across burkitt lymphoma or something I know exactly where that fits in my thing when I come across antiphospholipid syndrome I'm not thinking what is that I'm thinking all I know that that fits in that branch of the calculation tree and therefore this is what's going on that I'm so over all this makes the whole subject a lot less overwhelming and I kind of wish I'd been doing this from day one of medical school of every single subject and I wish I was doing that before even though the subject when I was scoping the subject which is why I like to call that I eat just sitting down with the syllabus and working out what is everything within Cardiology what is everything within respiratory medicine just taking those one or two hours to sit down and build tree for that subject would have been absolutely understand Maybe then when I get new piece of information I'm not just you know checking into a notebook and hoping that it sticks I'm hanging it on my tree of knowledge and therefore increasing the chances that I'm likely to retreat at the benefits of categorization Ball State find yourself getting a bit overwhelmed by it and think about it as maybe a tree of knowledge I found that very helpful in my life have you'll find it helpful in yours and finally let's talk about into leaving so testing spacing and interleaving needs to store mixed practice is like mixing up you want to learn in this again has to do with formulas conceptual models for now it's so if you're teaching kids how to learn a certain type of math problem that they actually have the same 20 math problem that has five of one kind five another five another five another ip55 C55D you be way better off mixing those all together so again they will struggle more will take them longer but they'll learn again more how to match a strategy to a type of problems that shows up in all sorts of learning studies 2 point where you finding a certain topic or sentence kill easy because as soon as you start finding something easy it then means you're not learning as well as you could be on this can feel incredibly unintuitive we will probably have that feeling where we're letting something and we finding it really hard and therefore oh I must be stupid I must not understand the subject enough but actually if you're finding learning hard that is when the learning is most happening well I kind of like going to the gym lifting weights that you find easy it's going to be doing anything for you but if you find hard add call of the same with the brain the brain is sort of like a muscle controversial but sort of like a muscle pain back to this idea testing the haunting of having to work to retrieve information the most strongly that information is going to get in coated and therefore learning should be difficult it should be mentally. which is why things like you know summarizing your notes from the textbook and highlighting they feel reproductive system easy to do and we feel like we're I've been guilty of this myself far too many times to count it's it's too easy like it's a lot harder to think about stuff to test ourselves before looking in the book it takes a little mental strength and therefore we will shy away from it thinking oh my God I'm finding it hard I must I must not be doing it right but in fact called you all doing it right if you find an easy you're not getting anything until then again this concept of interleaving is talked about quite extensively in make it stick so get a plug for that book if you haven't read it you should read it it's really good before we wrap up with some final thoughts I just want to give a message this video skillshare is a massive online learning community with thousands of process from also the topics ranging from

The weather in Cambridge and today I'm joined by my brother brother Instagram questions writes like a life advice and our opinion about things like success and motivation and Hot Wok and maybe the two of us maybe you listen to a podcast could not every thinking maybe you want to find out more about us will be talking about some of that in this video but otherwise this video is not going to be very valuable tool so if you're looking for something Alexa add value to your life I'd recommend following Jesus like checking out any of the other studies videos or productivity videos that I made you can check out channels like Peter McKinnon or Matt d'avella to get some inspiration for Value anyway what is a CV look like College had a great time after I graduated I worked in London is a data scientist for a year and starts up who listed the property space for the past few months I've been running my own starts up with one of my friends this is literally what I tell her use the people using the old soles of things and modeling is a really really valuable use case most enormous amount of economic value flows through most companies make decisions based on the same way that companies like a table if taking the data storage use cases for LG G7 product we have to remain how how long do you want me to go different version of Microsoft Excel what is different about you both and what's similar which I think is not really that different is the academic stuff I think it's easy to read a lot into the university and like quite frankly when you were considering selling something like math and for most of my life I want to be of that so like there's nothing fundamental about us that made me I think it's pretty cool you seem to be very into the knife advice kind of angle and we're not very smart. Episodes.com where we discussed the issue at length about how we feel about life advice I'm a big sucker for Life advice doesn't like it I think is wrong but address right now everybody good good fits it doesn't shrink in the wash too much and looks really good French Connection 1060 but you still my s*** Spotify everything what we disagree on we disagree on the last thing I asked the other person's views on things and I think we each other is there anything that inspires you about your brother question applies to both of you would like original ideas about things on the internet and in books and books and stuff and then I repackage up those ideas and kind of cell the cell done with my own spit on them whereas I feel like you spending all your time actually actually kind of observing the world thinking about how I wonder why that's the way that it is whereas I would just completely miss the old eviction and spend my time thinking about what's an equity I can make appreciate that because the thing I find inspirational about you is that maybe I'm too caught up in trying to be original trying to do something double as a lot of times when I should just get things done and I think you're pretty good at that nice all right yeah I guess so my thing I can in secondary school was kind of very self-motivated doesn't exactly have a cycle the 11-plus again drama school rankings in this is the exam when we were in the 07 which of the first year of secondary school in the UK what's an eye exam on so I can buy yogurt until you're like my whole raison d'etre I hold a lingua Franca for that to happen. 3 is was to try and maintain my position is number one in the air and it was a very kind of self-driven thing it wasn't that my mom was telling me earlier to Compass but it was that was like my mother at my whole identity and said that was an internal pressure based on this external Mazda the Westview academically you like within take whatever I got a sofa Marco. Can you describe what you went through them I just have a standard format I like I've decided on anything I just do that. Because I feel like if your intentions things are formats there's nothing ready able fencing about that like you're just never does the format my happy birthday for my uncle is always or lowercase happy space birthday space and then their first name with the first letter capitalized and then! It's been like that since I've been about 13 that describes what's going on the picture I feel like if I'm if I do some thinking I will get caught up in like what what am I trying to Signal here how much want to come across like being with anything about this Jelly Bean affected your life both positive and not usually it's a fun thing we do every week it's nice to people listen to it's nice to hear people's thoughts Warren. There and try to have a record of things because I often find that but I'm like hang out with my friends and I told about stuff and stuff that we talked about the podcast in my thoughts or do you like in a full through and solidified on these topics convertible Mustang with me for the podcast I haven't really affected my life that much back to my last message late but I mean it's quite nice kind of being a celebrity whereby you know when people have MeetMe beta like if they've seen the videos hopefully they'll already have like a positive image of me which means I have to work less hard to get them to like me this is quite nice the extra money I mean refrigerated is a story about 13 I decided off man I really need to get my life in order and and the things that I feel we get my life in order is that if I had like a consistent user name across home I kind of various forms and stuff pulled out how to use them for like Frogger 22 bunch of other even more embarrassing ones in Naruto someone how to use them cool desk lamp it's going to be generic stuff people like my friends I'm glad I should have that kind of stuff with other people that was nice I enjoy the least I think my attitude towards studying was really I kind of went in not really caring by academics and I kind of thought whatever I just want to see the coast in scrape through that was recently and I think I would have enjoyed it more and got more out of it if I have to wait until 48 actually stopped myself the friends I got very involved in the Pakistan society and Islamic societies that was good to make some friends through that least favorite part we know it's electrical kind of boring sometimes but I think everyone finds that just like plenty of other people at work about spreadsheets what do people mean when they say I'm proud of you it seems to be something different to I'm happy for you which kind of means that I'm happy that you're happy I think have you ever told someone you're proud of them please help me out here said I said I think I said it a couple of times instinctively are the can phrase you say when someone comes to something I think she meant I'm happy that you happy like I'm happy for you I said there was a few replies and my bone 13 on Twitter said to me the phrase I'm proud of you in part means I'm happy that you're happy but also adds recognition that you had to overcome something to achieve that happiness that I posted process you struggle to overcome obstacles embarrassed to get a happy outcome I'm happy you happen to get a free chocolate cake from the bakery Adam as it is ads on the Twitter said I think it means I'm happy for you and also I feel like I've had some hand in your success and he said that's how he usually reads it for that month I will think the rest of the week Friday if you want to have a look at the rest of it why suspect you are inwardly quite arrogant arrogant mean you feel like your big deal what's the difference between that and being confident in your sorry what's the difference between that and being confident in your book and I'm I'm on board with that but the fact that you are so open about saying I have Diversified my identity and I'll get my self-esteem from movies different things implied you think you'll see live in our success in various different areas is like really meaningful and made it feels wrong way cuz that's fine. That's the whole thing to believe but I think you think so so in my book the difference between arrogance and confidence confidence is a big deal that you're better than others Mystic view point whereby someone kind of feel that you are better than them in some way or another because of your accomplishments or because of something or another it's a relative its self on the external achievement side of things as the driver for confidence and I but he doesn't seem too proud of the fact that I've done these things I found out that might be a little bit about how did you feel about it people always off things like who is the something one I think people actually do to the ice it's like one of my least favorite things I think whenever I am in a situation where you know I'm meeting some siblings and some group that's how to make a conscious effort to see them as their own people and not try and dropped passes like who's better this who's what's the most annoying thing about having a doctor brother the people in our local Asian Community all dumped his lot of a family adults is growing up and also when when you're surrounded by lots of people who are doctors open the conversation will be about medicine so we had a bunch of people over a couple of weeks ago I will these people I was literally the only person who who didn't study medicine telemedicine most of the conversation was about medicine and look on the face but this is fine if you if you were growing up in that kind of environment where most people you know about medicine talk about medicine then you kind of implicitly feel a bit devalued and honestly I kind of feel a bit marginalized when it comes to that's a lot of people around you don't really mean cat what you what you do and what what you what you care about your then don't explicitly saying they don't bother you with it at Value these other things but implicitly don't feel valued when we go to we have family events and stuff I'm at a wedding in Pakistan a few months ago I need all the family from Otherworld kind of converge on this one place and you haven't seen all these people for a few years I thought you were talk to now you graduation from Cambridge martial law well done you must be so proud I didn't look at me in this a okay cool I would say they feel sorry for you for actually I have heard stories about like other people who are from similar backgrounds who didn't do medicine and people straight-up assume that they do medicine because they didn't get his medicine and the Elephant eyes when he meets people anyways great ahead of time feel like you haven't been pulling your weight on the topics for the reasoning discipline Kobe's favorite movies and series all right what are your hobbies how do you feel about that this whole stages of puppies being like this thing that you supposed to have everyone should have a side hustle even though that's that's awesome it I'm not saying this is bad in this. like 85 musical instrument I find a piano books what you do great you have a good answer to this question if you do all the things which are bit less down to hottest Define browsing forums and got a vague e-reading by web design and Bailey find a code and but what are these days I'd like to get back into badminton and fishkeeping I need to make an effort to do those two things and then going to make videos on the side you got me movies my favorite movie slippery The Dark Knight amazing massport my upbringing anytime soon thank you for the Mike Hart last Elizabeth Throne my Rising routine out of whack just ready just a bad excuse for saying I haven't written probably too well but I'm getting back into it two pieces about Ray tangible topics.

            "text": " my friends welcome back to the channel if you need to hit my name is Ali I'm a doctor working in Cambridge this is a study with me video or I talk through my study routine and methods today are trying to have a productive evening after work I get home at around 6 p.m. after a hard day of saving lives Alexa turn on concentrate in the living room hey Siri play country music everywhere into my study we're off to everything study I sit down at my desk around 7 p.m. and then the real fun begins this evening on preparing for a physiology supervision that I'll be running for medical students quite exciting Leon now physiology supervisor Gaston College at the University of Cambridge and so every week I'll be teaching physiology 210 incredibly lucky first-year medical students and so each week I'm going to be spending lots of time refreshing my own knowledge of human physiology and trying to build teaching sessions around the various Concepts I can't reach the first topic we tackle is nerves and membrane so it's refreshment knowledge about that I dig out the Lexus life that we got way back in 2012 and try to get my head around the basics of cell membrane structure and membrane potentials using my enormous monitor triple window set up with electric slide on the right hand side my own keynote in the middle and an ocean window on the left hand side to take brief notes as I'm going through that I just lied I'm asking myself every Point does this make sense and thinking back to the stuff that I found difficult seven years ago and working into my insides the topics where the Lexus light isn't fully detailed or if I'm thinking this story doesn't make sense in my head that I'm using Google to try and find out more information this is the key when we're trying to understand anything you load we should always be telling ourselves the story and our heads and if we get to a point where we not happy with anything we do a bit of research and figure out why would not happy with it while I'm grappling with these various Concepts in my head I'm also taking note of the various VIPs that I mentioned in the lecture slides the Cambridge medicine causes a bit weird and not does a big emphasis on expire evidence of just knowing about membrane potentials we get extra marks for understanding the historical context and the various experiments that led us to the conclusion that we now take as fact and sew in notion on writing down the important names and dates and if I need to add more information I can I'm not into the page over time all day for build up a database of experimental evidence and I'll be really helpful when writing essays or making flashcards for active recall for the down the line by the way I have questions from students asking how I take notes play study tips videos where I say that summarizing content with the book open isn't an effective strategy for retaining information compared to other things like activerecord space repetition and into the practice and there is a mountain of evidence supporting them got this whole note taking thing in depth but as a general rule of thumb taking notes with a book open re what I'm doing here is absolutely find one-way in the understanding phase of studying especially if we synthesizing information from different sources and putting it all in one place so here for example I'm trying to understand the story of how the structure of cell membranes was discovered using some Google searches some review papers and Alexis life and therefore I'm writing down the points to build up the story once I understood the content however taking notes very ineffective revision strategy at that point I should write questions for myself will make flashcards and test myself on this information with active recall and spaced repetition so to summarize in the process of memorizing the content then testing ourselves is the way forward I do all this for about an hour until 8 p.m. when I find my mind wandering and so I got up and warm a tupperware of food that I cooked a few days ago cool thing of watching a documentary on curiositystream the world-leading documentary streaming platform this one's part of an original series about nutrition and it tells me about the importance of having whole grains in our diet and the various positive Health implications of that while watching this documentary on the mint at the lack of whole grains in my eye end result to eat more oatmeal and quinoa if you fancy joining me on this journey of being super productive and watching educational documentaries at Double speed while doing menial things like eating food then head over to curiositystream.com. And if you use the coupon code free trial to sample any of the documentaries that you like off the food I make myself a cup of spicy chili to eat before realizing that the milk is 9 days out today and there I was thinking that I've got my life together from 8:30 otherwise I continue my quest to understand human physiology at this point I come up math behind the nernst equation and spend some time really making sure I understand exactly what's going on and working through some math problems I also try and weed together a story about how these equations with discovered so that if I were to write a mock an essay about it I could bring an experiment to support my points getting my head around this. Of scientific research and understanding the equations I decide to take a break around 9:30 p.m. to FaceTime my mom and grandma in the shade of this pachira tree houseplant thing at 10:15 I get back to work and now I'm Brown true false exam papers to test my understanding of the stuff that I've done this evening this is another really important part of effective studying testing ourselves as we go along to make sure we actually understand the subject I find some multiple choice questions that are relevant to these people exit that I just went through and screenshot those into I said that at the end of the supervision the students and I can Blitz through them I find that going through questions is often a very satisfying way to end a study session on teaching session because if we've done our job properly in the question should be very doable and if not then we know what we need to address next time coax right 11 Nicole Had A Satisfied having gone through full lectures of content understood most of it and been able to form an hour-long teaching session around at the day ends with my usual routine of brushing my teeth getting changed and then reading in bed on my Kindle until I fall asleep at the moment reading the faithful and the Fallen series by John Gwynne which is pretty awesome Alexa lights out in the bedroom but the only problem with that is that actually makes me stay up very much later than I should because it's just so gripping at enjoyable anyway"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hit my name is all they are mature enough to work in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to share with you the essay memorization framework that I used when I was in my third year at Cambridge University and I pretty much exclusively attribute that to this essay memorization framework this method should work for most SAT subject but even if everything turn stems into video description and you can skip around the video if you feel like it let's just jump into it so they're basically Tuesday just to this message the first date is the Creation Station sa plans for every conceivable essay title that they could throw at us in the example in the memorization stage we're going to be committing all of these as he plans to memory by systematically using activerecord spaced repetition by the diagrams and flashcards the idea is that by the time memorize so many as a plan. A lot of stuff from your brain onto the paper but even if stuff comes up that you haven't memorized you'll know so much about the subject and you'll have so many content blocks in your head that you'll be able to right of First Class essay from scratch so that was a general overview that's now talk about the two components the creation State and the memorization stage in turn objective of the creation stage is to create a large number of really good essay plants that you can memorize in the memory we go to take on the paper during your exam now it's probably beyond the scope of this video for me to teach you how to write a good essay and probably also beyond the scope of my own expertise and but I will share some tips on three main questions and that's how you decide what to pick how you make sure you as a plant is really really good deal with those interned suffer State how do we decide what we're going to prepare the objective is to scoop the subject and find essay titles that cover the entire breadth of the syllabus pause papers and look at whatever you have available and see what essays of comp in the past and you start off with those and then once you've planned out there that says you will know enough about that subject in particular that you'll be able to put yourself in the shoes of examiners and start thinking okay what's a good I've not yet often about if you have available that I'm very sorry to hear that you're just going to have to put yourself into the examining shoes from the get-go or you can actually go to your teacher your professor you Alexa or whatever and say hey what's this should be thinking about so how do you make a list of what I say is we're going to need to actually plan those essays and this is the fun part actually requires doing some doing some cognitive labor karate made like five essay plans in the second time I'm at about 10 and then of the Easter holidays already wrapped up in about thirty five different ones on the way I'll do it is that question so for example do animals have a theory of mind and then I would use Google to get as much information as I can about that particular question I would ignore the lecture notes initially and I would ignore the recommended reading papers going to be reading through those review papers open time to review paper with Dorothy answer the question in which case I pretty much got my essay I just need to turn it into my own words the time I'll be following references from the from the review paper and then once I created my I would then look at the lecture notes in the recommended reading and this meant that a lot of my material was hopefully more original than everyone else's because most of the students would have built on a random Google search research document on that particular topic and pretty much copy and paste every relevant bit of every paper I can find so this is my 10-page document about theory of mind I've copied and pasted various bits and rephrase various bits this is empty nose ring fitting for the bottom to where I got the information from Stephanie to return to it I'll be able to find it again and then once I've got my planning out the essay different results from books from the video papers from the lecture notes from Google and consolidate them into this one essay that I'm ultimately going to memorize the convergent evolution theory of intelligence do animals have a theory of mind is so now we've done our races. Candace I say we pretty much written out based on our research document and we going to give it ourselves one day to do this because of Parkinson's law that work expands to fill the time we allocate to it how do we make that are actually good number one structure number to actually answering the question number 3 having a flare-up the spice that your Sprint plan and I think the introduction is the most important part of USA because in the introduction you can signal to the examiner that you're doing all three and smoking a paper of the probably really bored they read hundreds of these scripts already you want to hit them would like a really legit introduction so here's an example of introduction from one of my essays about whether judgment and decision-making is coconut a biological or affectively in motion Labyrinth at the historic review in social sciences has always been that judgment are based solely on contact information with individuals being a seem to form judgement by systematically evaluating all available contact information in an unbiased manner contact information on the basis of Phoenix it is effective and cognitive is number 1 decillion to be effective feelings number to the representativeness of the effective feelings for Target number 3 the relevance of the feelings to the Judgment number for the evaluative malleability of the judgment and number five the level of processing intensity and I will discuss these internal and ultimately argue that that generally speaking in day-to-day life the circumstances are generally those that resulted effective than cognitive judgment and decision-making if we can disentangle verbosity from that paragraph is I've laid out the five main bits of the essential destruction of use numbered points for that rather than just a list because numbered makes it really examine I've also asset exactly what the answer to the question is the question is asking whether or effective emotional instead of wishing wishing I have said in this essay I will argue that they are emotional rather than cognitive in most elements of a lost and found flare hopefully with this stuff about the historical context I probably got that from a textbook from a review paper somewhere and I've totally phrase into my own notes and obviously this is my plan exam to using at 141 so it's absolutely not plagiarism using useful results you create a bit of flare bottom of historical context introduction and the section of the video to the art of writing a good essay anything I'm very good at writing an essay but I think I'm pretty good at using Google effectively and cutting and pasting stuff into a research what document and then turning into Fanny legit sounding pros and then I think I'm pretty good at systematically memorizing information so if you want to know more about how to write an essay how I write an essay then let me know the comments and I'll maybe try new video on it if I can break down the process of a feather really good essay plans that we have created in Word documents now the objective in the memorization stage is to upload all those as a plant to a brain so that we can then regurgitate them in the exam I'm going to do this using three main techniques number to spider diagrams on number three a retrospective revision timetable I said what I've done is that you can see I've got keywords on the front of a 1984 or 2006 and then over time I'll memorize these because pretty much anything that goes into my Anki flashcards because during the exam time I'm going through my flashcards every single day and I'm doing Auntie spaced repetition algorithm I just know that anything that with mold out of Hell by Meat actually. So so basically if I put a paper rustling Fair 1987 describing in the Auntie flashcard what that paper shows which means that eurolive critic rate these blocks of content that every Anki flashcards is on the Block and that block can slow into my essay that I planned but also if a weird as it comes up that I haven't explicitly planned I still have all these blocks in my head and that means there is a paper that's relevant I'll know what it is I'll know where the references on over the Continental know how know how to describe the experiment and I'll just be able to put it into even knew essays that I'm writing on the spot in the exam from 1974 or less violence track from mm those things aren't that helpful unless you can also associate them with their own essays and that's where the spider diagrams Asian frame with involves spider diagrams and this is the book that I have made almost $5 grams in so having memorized a ton of content blocks from my S8 using Anki flashcards what I've not done is from the 20th of April I made spider 1 Peg diagrams of every single sa so here's the first one about implicit vs. explicit memory we've done a various topics of the memory cognitive Maps mesophilic metacognition is the essay about short-term memory versus long-term memory is starter for the introduction then something about single system memory than something about the two components and if we never hear we see our actual refers to the flash card over here where I talked about a glanzer and cunitz 1966 flashcard I'll go to contact program describe an experiment that actually this is just like a whole paragraph age is badly and someone else I think hitch I used to know exactly what that refer to back in the day and I've done this to every single one of the 40 50 essays that I memorized every day I would just go outside very spotted are drums from memory so on the 20th as we can say I did impress explicit short-term long-term memory the 21st at a future planning I just be reminded theory of mind intelligence effect explanation multiple intelligent while I was on the 21st of April 2015 but the point is that every single day I'll be throwing out these grounds for memory and if there were any bits that I didn't know or that was look up on my Mazda spider diagram or when my mustache and actively working those two overtimes ended up being like an effective way to systematically use active recall to ensure that I am you absolutely everything and like in the time before the exam I was just bashing Lisa you know dates of May we've done this one we've done this water than that one another one another one another one another one I think this will on the 8th of May for exam 8th of May of just absolutely plant about 15 different spaced repetition so how do I decide what I'm going to do today if you see this is my retrospect revision timetable so it's split up into Section 8 section being section c c implicit memory walk down all the various things other than 20th of April and then I think on the 21st I did some of BNC up so you can see on the 21st of April the next time I do them I am walking the date for that and then I'm at the time so I've been retrospective revision timetable where I explain exactly how it works how I'd recommend using it and why I think it's better than it sounded prospector version timetable VSA memorization framework that I used to systematically memorize about 45 to 50 different essay using a mixture of active recalled specifications flashcards and body diagrams and that ended up going quite well to me I think about search of the essay titles out of the 12 SS we have to write essays that were part of my auto ready plant them so it was pretty easy enough to just regard to take what I already knew onto the page which is awesome for the essays one you that never been off before I had predicted them but because I knew so much about the subject like the time if you do ask me any question at all about animals psychology or if you do ask me any question at all about like you or intelligence personality or short-term memory long-term memory or Eternal judgment decision-making on you so much about the subject based on memorizing only that says. It was pretty straightforward to build an essay from scratch in about 10 minutes in the exams just planning out using a spotted diagram and then regurgitate using using my own pumpkin blocks from my auntie flashcard but also just being able to write whatever I wanted because I knew the subject so well I need to email my supervisor and she said that she beat me by a few like you know decimals of a percentage point but because the two of us was so far ahead of everyone else they decided to jointly awarded the price of that. that would make for a less click baby turtles apologize for that if I've misled you thus far subsequent years but after speaking in third year I decided that I wanted to other things ended up kind of reverting to inefficient habits like reading and highlighting and stuff in my. Still having this stuff in the back of my mind meant that I was able to use my retrospective revision timetable to efficiently get pretty reasonable Mountain exams while also standing aside career running a business and running a YouTube channel which has been efficient if you want you can put in a box but if you want to do all the stuff on the side it means you have the time Link in the description to a page about this thing on my website where I will put all of the commonly cause questions and answers if you do have specific questions about this message because it's probably easier to audiences there directly rather than pulling through YouTube come in and I don't have people going to trade me for using a clickbait title but yeah I know if you liked Instagram photos and videos and stuff how to make these videos in blood life is a dumpster in the UK is like my brother and I have also recently started a new podcast it's called not overthinking and that's where we think about topics in daily life like happiness creativity"

getting it set up and then I'm going to do a quick Whistle Stop tour through all of the different apps that I use on a daily basis to things like productivity make a note I'm so used to use as a student but also stuff that I used to make videos into make my life a little bit more efficient and productive whenever I'm on my computer to everything I'm going to talk about I'm going to be in the video description so if you don't like unboxing there if you want to see a particular you can just find it in the description unboxing and get it set up I'm very excited oh well the thing is huge look at that was in the box okay so I've got this laptop setup now I'm now in the process of downloading love these out so let's get started with what I think is the most important for my personal productivity and that is Alfred Alfred as a spotlight replacement which means that when you press come on in Spaceballs you got little search box type anything into that so you can search Google you can search files you can even open any app and it's just a lot more efficient than using using the trackpad and clicking on the thing sitting on the dock in the opening opening the iPhone about kind of Road perspective doing the right things but secondly it's also about seeing quick at help writing the computer itself so for example that's how I want to open a file how to take the dog to confine do find it through my photos I take about 10 seconds of my life and then we die if you know the name of the Fall you can just do come on spacebar and then name of the father and within about one second you go to spot open up that you want so you reduce this out of Lifetime that's why I use Alfred number to I really like movement which is a utility that lets you snap windows to the side when doesn't have the speed of Ages but for some reason Max don't have a native keyboard shortcut like come on shift and which is why use and then you can just type in left or right and then that snaps the window to either side of the screen I will survey like the Bartender Bartender just kind of cleans up those icons that you get in the corner and because a bit of a minimalist I like that list of icons being minimal has the most important thing so for example my battery and Wi-Fi where is all the other things like Google Drive Adobe Creative Cloud I will the other kind of apps that stay open but Behind these three dots wasn't quite policy to Alfred Newman bartender will be the utilities that I used most often intended for creating stuff I've got a monthly subscription that gives me everything back when I was a student this is quite cheap it's now becoming more expensive so I need to consider how much I'm spending on this other stuff I use everyday almost everyday office in Lightroom which I use for editing on my Instagram photos and everything for Facebook are you supposed to show up quite a lot to make light graphics and things for for my website I use Adobe Audition to occasionally do some editing for these videos using After Effects but I do like downloading templates for it and modifying them so for example for my medical Monday's intro to creative Cloud apps I use most often tons of Music editing for my well want to do songs will cover the songs I like guitar or piano parts I use logic pro for that and then I think about this is that with the Apple education bundle for about 200 pounds is still calling money you can get Final Cut Pro and load it for and compressor in motion on the other can you get the mold for a 200lb in total has makes it much much more foldable rather than the monthly fee that you have to pay to use the Adobe products anyway moving on I think Spotify does have a superior product that to-do list app I like to use is cold things I guess this is again expensive expensive is Santa getting things done out of approach to productivity and efficiency does a few books on that data link in the description below of such things as basically a very nicely designed to do list that lets you pretty much add anything to it you don't inbox you could like us someday list you go to today list and you've got different areas of your life that you can organize so for example my YouTube videos as one area of my life my kind of medical work is another area so you can categorize things very nicely using things about the to-do list after I like to use the app that I used to making notes is called bear a couple years ago because it's evident starting to get very bloated in very slow to Bear which is a much more simple writing experience and the nice thing about berries that you can write in markdown markdown it's just like a very easy way of formatting text weddings in bold and italics so if I'm writing my weekly emails but you can subscribe to in this link down below or if I'm writing a blog post my blog is hosted on ghost and ghost latiroides knocked out so we'll have to do is write something in Bear and paste it as marked down into ghosts and then I hope he has not before my my website that's what he's bad for I don't use Badger track my workout every time I go to the gym I just have a single note and I just had stuff to it as I go along because you know what to say what gets measured gets managed what's the price on a 70 people don't know it even exists so I'm in a lot of WhatsApp groups of them for $4 and I took a lot of my friends through WhatsApp but I always find it annoying having to go in my phone and type with keyboard I need to download it you scan a QR code with your phone and then you log into WhatsApp and you get WhatsApp messages through my foot that's what I think so what's happened pretty pretty good you have that life on the cloud and in in the Google account or whatever your accounts get compromise that would be an absolute catastrophe so 1 + I just basically basically make it really easy to generate secure passwords for all your different websites and in order to access them you have to just log in with your one password so you log into one house with the app with your one password and then it would magically feels in your inner Sakura Paw Patrol these different website security stuff behind it and if you can you can read more about that if you want but pretty much everyone it manager is also lost pause and a few others but one positive one that I started using and I've never really found any reason to stop so that was a very quick. but I do want to make it more of a thing I really enjoy Tech on my second to the last and I quite like making diesel to video so I hope it's useful I need extensive video about how I use Alfred and how superchargers my productivity is will do video about that and then maybe a few other things like today I've had enough of go in my iPhone so lovely and it's three strikes out except the hard drive to cut that cost like $3,000 extra lights over the one terabyte hard drive but hopefully this should make my own video editing and stuff workflow much more quickly you haven't subscribed to have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need him my name is Aaliyah I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and a very Happy New Year to you I'm going to be taking you through some of my favorite apps on my iPad and as usual everything is going to be mentioned in time stamps and Christ by category in the video description and append comments you can skip around if you liked it but yeah let's just jump into it all right so we'll stop by just blitzing through somebody General productivity / utility apps that I use Microsoft Outlook is my email Choice it gets the job done it's pretty as fast it works the Calendar app that I use is called Fantastical and the nice thing about that is that is going good natural language processing which means I could type meeting with brussel sprouts tomorrow 5 p.m. or something like that it would just recognize all the different elements of the event and I'll be able to add it to my calendar with a single click so that's why I like using Fantastical and the app that I use for my to-do list is cold things in two different areas of your life so 6-minute is my company YouTube obviously and all these different categories of videos that I want to make and that means I don't have to think about what I need to do I can just kind of go on the app and see list in front of me about the apps that I use for educational stuff Rosetta Stone to learn Japanese for the last few months because I went there on a research program in my second year of medical school and then enjoyed myself at some point I'd like to do some kind of medical placement in Japan if you want to do medical stuff that so one of my New Year's resolutions for 2019 is to try and do a little bit of Japanese everyday using Gap so if I'm on the toilet or something I'll just bust out Rosetta Stone to my phone or if I'm just sitting at my desk or if I'm at work and I've got nothing to do for 5 or 10 I just busted out on the iPad and just work through some of the lessons it makes it quite easy it's quite fun you got these like little points at the end of every section and it's quite nicely gamified so using the Apple doesn't feel like work if you know you're interested in video description discount you can get Rosetta Stone for just five pounds a month and has money but I think if you are serious about learning a language that's a price worth paying flashcard app alternative to Anki I used to use Anki medical school but I'm not supposed to Quizlet cuz I think the interface is let you know I sent and it looks a little bit I'm going to be using Quizlet to prepare for some of my postgraduate medical exam CP which is the membership of the Royal College of Physicians I haven't quite decided yet which kind of specialty I want to go down previously thought I was going to but now I'm considering medicine or emergency medicine so depending on what I decide with that Quizlet as my flashcard app of choice to out of work to woods these postgraduate medical exams questions on the side of a Google sheet so for example this is my active recall spreadsheet for 2018 and I've got some questions written on the side with color coding based on whether I got them right last time I tried it is written in white text in the in Kelowna BC when you can see the answer is at the bottom so if I need to look at the on so I can see it I'll be doing a much more detail video about exactly how are you do with sheets in the next couple of weeks hopefully let's talk about apps that I use for writing now and there are five in this country great and I have to use all of them on a note the first one is day one which is what I use for so I write down stuff about my day and not some photos the nice comments that you guys have sent so day one is my choice if I use is notability on notability is wonderful it's very easy to use the apple pencil to write stuff by hand and I will use it to store like textbooks and to store my to do list.. I have to do at work each day again I'll do much more detail to the about that I'm not putting up with that to a video that I made last year about exactly how he has no stability to take notes when I was a medical student is Bayer icer for example if I'm planning out a YouTube video or something like that I'd make Adobe document and then I think about Barris die during interphase it feels very cool and I quite enjoy writing on it and I also use it to track thing what might my gym workouts and I just like a very nice simple easy to use markdown based writing out that doesn't have all the bells and whistles that something like Evernote does speaking of my medical work-related stuff so for example if I'm preparing for my MRCP or mrcog exam then I'll be making my anime notes in Evernote like tucked up stuff and like drawing different resources together but I would already be using it as a general note taking app like I have Costco's I prefer bear for that purpose and funnily enough that I use on a weekly basis is Ulysses which is what I use to write my weekly email newsletters on my blog posts what you can check out the link in the description below and the writing you can write Styles and the nice thing about this is that it's a very distraction-free writing experience and it's kind of just a pleasure to write on it so my friends is how I stole all of my emails and you can check out the previous issues of my emojis that said if you feel like it firstly that's the Kindle app I don't actually read much of my iPad cuz I have an actual Kindle for that I think the experience of reading a book on the actual Kindle is much much better than reading the same book on the Kindle app on the iPad but one thing that annoys about the Kindle app is that is very easy to flip around through books and to see my highlights and notes so for example from Atomic habits these Roma highlights is quite a few highlights and if I ever need something or need some inspiration for email or a blog post I can just kind of quickly browse through my highlights it's just it's just right there so this is kind of my main purpose for having Kindle on my iPad secondly I use pocket on my iPhone and my iPad to save articles that I want to read but I don't have time for there and then what is gold on red so I follow about 50 different blogs and it's a pain in the bum going on every website and such a complete waste of time just an RSS feed aggregator and Aggregates all the different blog post. Sarasota by category so you know Doctors Medical ethics minimalism money productivity and stuff like that so that is the RSS reader of choice using practice my salt reading on the piano thing about that is that it just randomly generates different pieces of music based on a difficulty level and if you set a key so I can just selected he a difficulty level and it would create a random piece of music for me which then I can use play stuff you piece of music which is been really good for learning sight reading will do it is more boring than thing few pieces. I already know but hey Department tabs HD which I will pick up my iPhone and it says the indispensable results to get guitar tabs or piano chords for pretty much any song in the world so if I'm doing a jam session with my friends or if I'm bored at home and I just want to sing a song I can just type in the name of the song Field of Gold by Sting and it just tells me the codes and I can play the chords while singing along and add happiness and joy to my life and hopefully to the lives of my neighbors as well usually take photos on my drone or my phone or my camera and roll. And then I transfer them to the iPad using the SD card or using a drill but whatever and then I'll be able to edit them using Lightroom I'm gesture controls and using the apple pencil how to change things like contrast exposure this that the other so this is the River Nile from my trip to Sudan from few days ago and this is the before edited version edited version I haven't changed a few of the color is a little bit my room is the app that I use for photo editing apps for the iPad for 2019 I hope you enjoyed it if you like the video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is La I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this video I'm going to be answering the age-old question of whether an iPad Pro with apple pencil can really replace a MacBook Pro or equipment laptop because I'm a fan of upfront tell you what I think right now and that is your iPad probably can't replace your laptop I can see why you'd want to I can see why it's a romanticized notion of an iPad replace a laptop but unfortunately we're not yet at the point where an iPad can feasibly replace laptop take a video and then you can click away and do something more to think of your time but for the rest of the operating on this point. autistic description so you can click to the timestamp before we go for what I just want to every month on my Spotify Premium membership with unidays student every country in the world Tucker this video I'm going to stop by talking a little bit about why you might think that an iPad might want to replace you're not 12 and the few cases in which it is good to have an iPad instead of a laptop but then I'm going to spend the bulk of the video myhealthware you like I do I've had cancer but it's just such a pain in the bum and I think that's kind of the story of this whole debate that use you maybe sort of kind of sort of replace your laptop with your iPad but it would be such an annoyance for a lot of do you want to do that is probably not worth doing I kind of wanted MacBook Pro and they start at about 1500 lb these days that's what money maybe you decided that using your computer to browse YouTube and Netflix and Facebook and stuff that works perfectly fine on the laptop so if you're just doing those things like writing a few assignments making those in class and watching multimedia it kind of makes sense doesn't it that you want to replace your laptop with I don't think that's quite the full story and now I'm just going to talk about various instances in which you would be glad that you had a laptop instead of an iPad that spoke about General efficiency at using the device and iPad on a MacBook so you're on creativity for your own tall is that it you don't want to be spending a lot of time doing what you want to be spending that time doing more interesting things a good time and set about General efficiency than the iPad is not a very efficient device The Touch navigation thing is cool but is it subjectively slower than navigating using a keeper one of my foot should I say you want to open a web address in the iPad you have to swipe up from the bottom to get the dog in African safari and then you'd have to click on the address bar then you have to type in the keyboard while you're at your earliest but if you have a Macbook and you using it to its full potential by using stuff like Alfred and things that help with keyboard navigation then pretty much whatever you thinking that you want to do on a computer to can just be done that little bit faster on a MacBook rather than on an iPad Student Self I found that what it was possible I was getting frustrated with how slow the whole process was because for me I'm very used to it as soon as I have something that I want to do in the computer I want that action to be done as quickly as possible a fast typing speed at something like Alfred a spotlight to even do that but with an iPod to a kind of a bit encumbered by by the software and buy just the general touch interface of the iPad annoying using an iPad for a long extended. Of time about writing a good reference software and integrating it within a word processor on the iPad is a lot more of a pain in the bum that is on a MacBook or Windows laptop on a MacBook or Windows laptop on to other friends who also likely have mental EMR software than they can add references to it and have been quite a few occasions in my time in Mexico where I've collaborated with friends on different papers and it's been so useful all of us having Microsoft Word with the mentally plug-in so that references Stockton get screwed up more of a pain in the bum on the iPad compared to the MacBook Pro you print anything these days but even someone like me who's going to completely paperless on here by myself because I've gone completely paperless I love the fact that I'm going to eat paperless I still have to print stuff medical school placement and printing stuff from an iPad is it's possible but again it's just a story it's a bit more of a pain you can always email it to a friend in authentic printed you could use HP amp printer Apple AirPrint but ready who has an African labels printed these days we're actually work and actually connect to the Wi-Fi with a laptop you know that if your printer is being completely screwed all you have to do is plug the USB cable into the laptop and you know you'll reliably be able to print something out so again if you want to print stuff having a having a Macbook makes it a bit more of a pleasant experience than having to struggle with the interface of an iPod what about presentations presentations already come in like depending on what sort of degree some kind of powerful Mokena presentation at some point what it is possible to create PowerPoint on keynote presentations on an iPad it's just a bit more of a pain that is crazy someone they'll know how it works is doing it when an iPad is possible but it takes more time and therefore whenever I've had to make a presentation and I've been on the go I've kind of started off with my iPad of yukino on my iPad I know at one point I was running a teaching session some of the students I'm going to be one of those people that just uses my iPod to make his presentation I'll connect it up to the projector and just navigate with my iPad and after about five minutes of struggling with Keynotes to try make the presentation I just gave up I decided to go home get my workout ended do this properly it was a lot quicker a lot more a lot more efficient and ultimately I was more productive and could do better things with my time because I had a laptop instead of tonight. a bit of a pain to navigate with the iPad I use Google Sheets fill out something that use it for my active recalls spreadsheets I use it for spaced repetition you can check out some of my videos about evidence-based it much easier just going to my MacBook login to do with shape and then just being able to do stuff about Foster that's I need to put a formula I need to condition if you try and just use an iPad instead of instead of laptop you find a lot of these little things like in theory it seems like a very reasonable thing like if you were student you want to handle your notes all you doing is watching Netflix it seems reasonable to think my laptop with my iPad my iPad easy to carry around it makes me feel a bit more hipster an edgy that I'm just using iPad Pro with apple pencil I would have thought that until I tried it and realized actually unfortunately we're still not at the point where an iPad can fully replace a laptop I feel absolutely love my iPad Pro I use it every single day I use at work, to do this I use it whenever I'm dropping YouTube video I use it whenever I want to take notes on anything but essentially for the most part I'm using my iPad has a glorified piece of paper and a girl the paper is not the only device that you want to have on your person if you really are in that position where you're choosing between an iPad and a laptop you could definitely go for the laptop. Just my two cents so I hope I've given you some kind of opinionated framework to decide this if you want to give it a go then by all means give it a go and let me know how it goes and maybe in a few years time when you know maybe tablets get more advanced or if I ever decide to switch over to the Microsoft go to bed I start using surface which is like a hybrid laptop and a tablet that maybe I'll make another video be addressing this point but I have recently tried just use my iPad instead of my MacBook and I find myself going back to the old ways and just using the iPad as a glorified thank you very much for watching and thanks again to unidays to sponsoring this video if you like the video please give it a thumbs up and I will see you in the next goodbye"

            "text": " another installment of the monthly favorite series today we're going to be talking about a book a podcast a blog post and a board game that I've enjoyed this month trip just made about how to edit videos or all that my own process of editing videos so if you care about how edit videos and you want to learn the workflow for video editing in Final Cut Pro glow to my skillshare online plus you can watch it for free if you have a skillshare premium subscription or if you don't can find app for a free 2-month trial using the link below and then you can just watch the cost of online class I'm going to teach you my whole editing workflow from start to finish how I import footage how I do the first payroll cut how I do jump cuts to hopefully try and keep things relatively smooth you learn how I bring in stuff from down and then things just a little bit of Masala to the video manual on how I do timestamps like all this stuff and how I do iPad handwritten animation so if you enter the whole video editing thing then you should definitely check out let's go to the video because I heard the book was really good it took me about two nights to finish this and I stayed up until like 4 a.m. both nights 2 months favorite video is well the system for books they can be either good or really good or really really good or really really good and they're really really real if they keep me up until 4 in the morning and this definitely kept me up until 4 in the morning across two nights at his adopted incredible the Earth is a bit screwed police news everywhere people living in slums in the city's but there is this guy for James Halliday who is invented this amazing virtual reality like realistic gaming experience and the whole population pretty much spent their entire life in this game because it's far better than Android and the really cool thing of the whole premise of the book is based on it the fact that one James Halliday does the guy who invented the virtual reality World call The Oasis when he dies he releases a message out to the world and he says that within the game within the Oasis he has hidden especialista any strike like a bonus thing that you seen some video games and he sets of this challenge for everyone in the world that if you can be the first person to find his Easter egg within the Oasis then you will inherit his whole fortune in his whole like multi hundred billion dollar company and you control the Oasis so everyone of the world pretty much then goes in a mission to find this Easter egg and it's. So he starts off with this clue and it becomes a case of trying to interpret the clues and trying to figure out why they leave so you'll eventually find that he's right and so we follow the story of this guy called Wade on his best to find this Easter egg Journey he needs those are the people who want to find the Easter eggs as a cheeky bit of romance in there and there's a big bad guy who's like the big evil corporation that employs thousands of people cuz they want to get their hands on the Easter egg first cuz then they can control this amazing commercial advertising in a laptop but it's like a very nice sort of coming-of-age story little bit of romance always good adventure action mystery suspense folding the story of these guys who going to meet each other online through the game and how they work to trying to feed his Corporation and it's absolutely sick so yeah Ready Player one use absentee read book and you can watch movies while then there are actually surprised me different like oh I forgot to mention every month I do this thing where when I when I review a book like the 3rd or last month I say that he leave a comment down below your Instagram username I'll randomly pick a comment and mail you a copy this book so the winner for last month's giveaway the door is let me just pick a random comment on YouTube OK the winner is broken chalk who's Instagram is Sophia broken chalk Sofia I'm going to be messaging you on Instagram and you will win a copy of your mail you a copy of this message Mesa reply to my Instagram DM please thank you if you want to have a physical copy plus you Instagram username and then I'll pick someone next month and will mail you a copy of this particular book or a second Leona talk about a podcast that I listened to recently and enjoyed and that is called my first million and it's a podcast that's run by the guys be muscle which is really good like technewsdaily email newsletter that I've been subscribed astrology months and so that's kind of like the premise behind it how did they like most of the guys I like multi-millionaires multi tens of millions of them are is multi hundreds of millions of years but it's more like the story of how they made the first Marriott the Holocaust started and what they would do if they were starting today without any of that connections on network money in it they would make about making the first minute and double episode with the guy who started the hustle email newsletter on how it grew into a multimillion-dollar business that was very interesting one from some guy who made a website called hot or not like in the early 2000s back way before it was like the internet now they struggle to pay for like hosting space because of the time web hosting was like super expensive and how they snuck into the university in like PT back to the university computer system to host the website for a bit very interesting stuff story behind people making the first move in whenever you like about this is that they don't shy away from talking about choking a lot in real terms so he forgot what he would say okay right now your company's worth 750 million how how much we King when he was 24 your first year starting this on the Gaza how I think it was making me about 30,000 a year and then he's like and how long does it take you to make his first million and then they like who actually probably about four or five years and they're open to breaking down the kind of fun to finish last nothing that's what you get because a lot of the time when you hear interviews and things like the Tim Ferriss show where he's interviewing like super super mega successful people you often don't get to hear the numbers behind a success as another reason why I really like the Indie hackers podcast because that break down Revenue some things so yeah if you're interested in the whole thing can find a nut iliza.com says hi on the founder of birth machine co-host of the music podcast any places that founder of cup and leaf tea this site hurts or writing on psychology self-education entrepreneurship marketing philosophy Health Finance improving yourself in general basically he's covering all the topics that is that I'm interested in the topic that I pretty much cover my videos in my website summaries from old books and stuff that he's ever read so there's like a really really really huge long-ass list of books awesome videos that he's taking his own personal notes from and just published for free to the world so that's another thing I want to do with my website that I found quite inspirational and there were few post of not that I really enjoyed in that really touched a nerve with Mesa he is done the whole thing where he has these multiple businesses. Bringing in passive income and he's he'll just do it off by reading the 4-Hour workweek by Tim Ferriss I was very interesting blog post for a joke about how he first got turned on to this audio my God you can make money like water you sleep and then you can like go live on the beach and stuff and that was a bug that really caught me about like 6 7 years ago when I first read the 4-Hour Work week and now for the last 6-7 years I've been trying to build up these various sources of passive income in my own life so that I don't have to rely on my full-time job as a dope tattooed make money do I could quit medicine I want to buy one if I could and that just gives me more freedoms like probably Weldon like do stuff but he has done this like he is going up passive income to be able to just travel the world and do whatever he wants but he talks about the the existential dread it. Tim Ferriss alludes to listen to for our quick as well and that's like once you got this lifestyle whereby you don't have to work anymore then what do you do like he went to Argentina for a few months and I even get his whole thing is that he wouldn't he how about Allah and then you realize that actually you know this whole set of fetishizing the whole traveling thing wasn't the route to happiness and now he's going to reject his lock priority than actually figured out what actually makes him happy now that he's broken free of this passive income because the people who are into this whole passive income on entrepreneurship make money on the internet type thing other people that think we will think we should have transcended the regular nine-to-five job and be like an hour Peapod into corporate wage slavery therefore I'm going to build a business on the side and therefore I'm going to be able to do whatever I want now that my finances are taken care of that wasn't God has actually you know you think about the case but when you get there you realize actually it's not all that it's cracked up to be I filled all the happiness you get from your end will come from Leo your relationship and you close friends and family and stuff and the City where you currently live rather than this amazing no hero traveling the world and living on the beach and doing whatever you want. because I'm still very much in this in this domain of life in the sphere of life where I'm trying to build up the source of passive income so that I can break free from my job even though I don't want to break free from my job businesses in and trying to make more money just to just break free I think overall it's still available things to do and always say I think my life would be a lot better if I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted and with that freedom I could choose to still be adopted people. Spoken to within medicine Hua because you know if you won the lottery would you still do medicine and there was a senior dog that I spoke to the other day he was like oh God no I want to know why being medicine if I won the lottery people like that they are exclusively doing medicine because it pays the bills and I never want to be in the position where I am being a doctor because I have to because it pays the bills and so I can come to build entrepreneurship but I love this guy's blogengine.net block because it just made me double like Nina doublethink think again about why I was doing all of this and we figure out what the priorities are in this whole thing so I'm just going on about my favorite ones and making notes and do so at some point I'm going to do what he does and my make Derek sivers does and publish them all online on my website that's like a thing that I'm working on at the moment but yeah if any of this sounds interesting stuff like that you check out this guy nuts blog and finally on talk about a board game and that is One Night Ultimate Werewolf board games subreddit and people who like this is like the best thing ever and dislike boardgamegeek.com Forum football games as well and everyone was raving about this yeah it's pretty rated what is the board game Avalon at one point as well in one of these favorites video I don't know if you will have watched videos everyone has their eyes closed in the backyard open their eyes but no one really knows anything else and there are some special characters that have more information and One Night Ultimate Werewolf is interesting because it's a board game but you haven't asked for like on your phone in the middle of the app so the Apple say you know you hit the play button you tell it how many people you got the Apple say things like now everyone close your eyes werewolves open your eyes look at each other werewolves close your eyes sear you may open your eyes look at one of the cards in the middle C R close your eyes robber open your eyes swap your card with any other card that you want close your eyes different players in the game play at 3 to 10 players of all the players have different roles and during the night face everyone else has their eyes closed different people wake up and do certain actions so then when the night is over and it's daytime then it becomes a case in front of figure out who the werewolf and killing them because of the end of that round the village as a whole has to decide to kill one person and so it becomes a case of people that are revealing little bits of information on the werewolves trying to pin the blame on someone else would being a werewolf and we have to weave this complex web of life to figure out who's who and everyone is so love working together to try and kill the werewolf or the whale was a working amongst themselves to try and save themselves and try and kill someone else and it's very interesting game filled with deception and lies and stuff and we had about five or six rounds and a Sound by the 34th really getting the hang of it and trying to formulate strategies and stuff so now when we get this group of people together again we're just going fast through the game hey I was to finish the game this is a very nice kind of party game if you have people that willing to engage engage with it you like the editing on this and you are interested in learning how to edit videos you can check out my costume skillshare they'll be a link in the description below. check out my website where I share more things that I like things I would recommend say if you kind of like this than you might like this and see you in the next video"

            "text": " the oven looking for new daily driver laptop for quite a while and after the years of waiting is finally here this is the brand new M1 2020 MacBook Pro laptop that I'm not going to be carrying around with me everywhere I go Kieran Culkin back to the channel 18 New Orleans adopted base in Cambridge and nothing is more exciting for a productivity nerd like me then switching laptops I don't say I think this is going to be a huge Improvement for my quality of life and mental well-being be perfect why I'm switching to it as my daily driver in the video description laptop is absolutely amazing it's got blazing fast performance it's absolutely ridiculous battery life that's pretty amazing. That's not a big deal and it is a small and light that I can just take with me everywhere I go that's why I love this that's why I'm switching to it as my daily driver from this huge ass 2018 15 inch MacBook Pro which is a real pain in the bum to carry around details let's start with the design and post on the MacBook Pros for the last several years it is pretty thin it's pretty lights on a set of scales it weighs 1338 grams it is basically the same way and they feel exactly the same an oven covering this whole point on his iPad Pro with magic keyboard on a pencil around with me here but now I can carry that in addition to this because there's something unlike a MacBook Air you do not get the wedge this is just a cure for the clap it feels nice feels good Leon thanks to the new M1 chipwich I've been carrying around a 15 inch laptop for the last two years because this is face back to house and it's one of those really annoying things where if I was going to my mom's place for the weekend or if I was traveling or going on a trip I would always feel the need to take my huge ass 15-inch MacBook Pro rival just in case I need to edit a video or edit a podcast and I'm going to make a video exploring this in-depth I still don't think an iPad even though iPad Pro even a 12.9 inch iPad Pro for me I don't easily replaceable laptop just me and said I would have to carry my iPad I take my laptop and every time I would put this into my bag I would say I thinking I really wish I had a small light 13-inch like very very powerful machine that I could just use as my and now it's fun to hear I'm so for now I'm basically this is going to go with me everywhere I go and I'm probably going to replace this with the new M1 Mac Mini reveal not coming in a little while we link up there I want to talk I'll have like a permanent Mac Mini base to set up desk and then I'll just be able to carry this around with me if I'm going to somewhere for the weekend or from going to a coffee shop or even if I'm just sitting on the sofa in the balcony this will be absolutely perfect rather than having to Lug this thing around this year previously all of the Apple laptops were based around Intel chips and so Applewood by the chips from Intel and it would be like an Intel I9 8-core whatever 3 the road chips for Mac they've been doing this for Years wallpaper from day one with the iPhone and the iPad which is why when you haven't had any type something it's just ridiculous default which is why iPhones feel ridiculous the numbers on the clock speed in the number of cores cuz they don't really have to and because they very very tidy control an integrated software the hardware and the processor it means everything works beautifully and seems to be together and I sound like an apple Fanboy I sound like I'm doing but it really is. Fast and if you put any review about this new M16 absolutely every reviewer even the tech reviewers would like zillions of years more experience and I do everyone is saying just how ridiculously blazing fought these new ships are and how seamlessly they seem to opcity everything let's take a quick look at the geekbench school so that's not normally I'm not a huge fan of talking about numbers but I think in this context the numbers actually show you just how far we've come with this new M1 chip design my GoPro is absolutely needed the path of the score of 1689 that is ridiculous because outside of these M1 chips the next best is the iMac 27 inch retina that has 10 fours that's with the Intel I9 processor that's going to cost at least a few compounds and I always got this thing for like of 99 pounds at 4 months $9 which is absolutely Bonkers at the numbers we see like these machines are sort of hovering around 11 1200 block of these are all of the old intel-based processes even the super super super expensive and this new M1 chip which is now on the entry-level MacBook Pro the entry-level MacBook Air and the entry-level Mac Mini is completely blowing them out of the water massively have 28 Kors 24 4-16-2018 cause these massive machines that cost tens of thousands of pounds are going to help perform but actually here we have the apple and one which is about 7,400 7200r 7000 look at what that's faster than that is faster than the 2019 16 inch MacBook Pro with the I-9 2.48 messing with the MacBook Air have money yet but I haven't noticed any issues in the slightest with performance and so I should have had to resort to licking a defense cores and trying to understand how this stuff works just to see how this even possible directions to Intel designs of the entry-level MacBook Air and the entry-level MacBook Pros you could quite easily stress them out by doing things like having like 80,000 Chrome open on Tango video on using Final Cut out and hear the noise the phone but now it's just ridiculous e Faust you don't see any performance issues and that's why I'm so excited to be using this as my daily driver moving forward are does not sure if I want to do stuff like video editing I put the option of a fan the MacBook Air will probably handle that completely fine as well but if you could have found then you put the option of running the processor a high-speed in the Falcon cool it down where is it would like these thermal throttle I don't even know if texting it enough to hit those that was performing but because for me this is only an extra 300 pounds and it's a business expense I might as well just go for the option of a fan and the extra I don't know 100 gram weights which is not really from the nurses and two other people even more important than processor speed because even these Intel processes that pretty fault fault I never really noticed any issues with the Foreman's but what I do know today issues with a battery life not for this 2018 1585 I have to carry around my charger basically everywhere I go because if I'm using from if I'm using Final Cut if I'm editing podcast the movie the weather I know the battery light like it's only going to last about four or five hours and Times of battery life or is this the advertised battery life for this 20 hours of video playback or like 18 hours a web browsing which is absolutely insane life there were saying the same thing the same that even ultimate after the MacBook Pro the battery life is still absolutely insane an overtime as more and more apps get optimized for this check the battery life is just going to improve and that is one of those things that actually makes a difference to how you would like to see when it comes to speed I'm not really going to notice the speed difference between about these days but I will actually notice a difference in battery life it's a difference between just being able to take this in my back and go to a coffee shop all day but having my back and having for the charger and then having to go to coffee shop where I find a plug then like quality of life Improvement not to have to worry about battery life and that is probably the main thing I'm so excited about with this new generation of MacBooks I think it was this year maybe like nastya rather than the old one was really really crap until this keyboard is absolutely fantastic test hundred 247 Westmont is not a bad idea to the typing test on the MacBook Air 459 has the same keyboard so I'll bring the roundabout 255 255 range but try not to keyboard but if I had to choose this one feels a little bit nicer over all other things in the cable is unfortunately we do still have the touch bar honestly I don't really use the touch Bar for a lot of things occasional user to select an emoji but off my fines at the control search option is a little quicker with keyboard navigation my trackpad every time I go to a computer so I can try them out and there are some Windows laptops to have a MacBook identical and we put the charge because I have to be back with all the things that we used to seeing an absolutely world-class track. No changes there no complaints from me eye retina display this has 500 minutes of brightness compared to the MacBook S400 is the brightness and amazingly bright but it's reasonably good if you're outside and often. I'm using my laptop on the balcony I think 500 at the brightness is a reasonable amount and I don't mind using it too much 400 it's on the MacBook Air is a little bit little bit hit-and-miss it's hard to reliably guess the screen brightness out of that phone and that's the reason why I think it's worth getting in terms of the ports are only two ports on this entry level model which I guess it's to be expected because it is only an entry-level model and I mean on this one but because I have a charger plugged in the whole time I don't think I'll particularly annoyed at the two-point situation usually if I do take this out and about I'm only using a maximum of two ports I'm not usually using 1/2 ports unless this is actually plugged into the whole shebang on my desk and of course we have a headphone jack for whatever that's worth white headphones but I guess it's nice if you're into that sort of thing as well that's the microphone now and apparently this MacBook Pro has studio-quality Mike's compared to the new Macbook Air which has no studio-quality mic so this is what it sounds like on the MacBook Pros microphone and now he's what would you sound that sounds like a my $500 audio setup sounds like and at the same time we can test out the webcam to webcam I kind of wish it was a little bit better people doing these days it would kind of be nice if it had a more 1080p a legit webcam this quality is probably better than it's been in the past because now within the new M1 chip that will dispense you have neural engine E-Type thing which apparently improve the image quality flight computationally using some software related stuff and I wish they would have had at least a 1080p webcam or just like us a camera on this given the amount of Zoom figuration options now if you are in the market for a budget laptop I see think the base configuration of this is completely fine keep you awake or GPU 256gb SSD storage that's one thing that I might think of upgrade answer for example if I was a student and I was very strapped for cash I would p**** just go to the MacBook Air cuz I probably don't need the MacBook Pro but instead of paying 899 for the MacBook Air I could play it pay instead 1199 for the MacBook Pro with the discount extra 300 lb return to that you get the fun you got to talk about with your silly pointless but you get the fan when you get slightly increase battery life and those are two things that I actually think it is probably what spending the extra money on I think the base model for most people is completely fine you might want to upgrade the storage storage and in fact for me tomorrow that I'm going to use is going to be well the footy desktop version because this is going to be a business expense and if it's my daily driver this is one terabyte SSD and it always runs out of space so it's going to be a really nice quality of life Improvement to not have to worry about the hard drive space but this is overkill for most people you do not need to spend 2,300 lb of $2,300 on an entry-level MacBook Pro and then if you're looking to spend that kind of money and you know someone who reviews Tech on YouTube and hopefully try to make money from it if you don't and you want this to be fully decked-out I'll probably wait until next year when hopefully the new 14 inch and 16 inch models of the MacBook Pro going to come out with this new Apple silicone design ship I'd probably wait those but most people if you're interested in getting a MacBook Pro honestly I think the base model is probably consider upgrading the ram if you use loads and loads and loads of very resource-intensive things that rely on Parallel processing review of the 2020 MacBook Pro for my review of the 2020 MacBook Air what you might like to check out and then very soon over here this going to be a video where I explicitly compare the new Macbook Pro with any MacBook Air and give some unsolicited which one which one you should get thank you so much for watching us in Activia"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew here 18 iPad Pro with apple pencil and basically trying to answer the question of whether you should buy it or not so to that end up into a few different parts and everything is going to be LinkedIn * X in the video description overall Impressions about the new iPad Pro and then I'll introduce a three-part flowchart by free questions to ask yourself before deciding whether to buy this or not review I sat and that is that this is clearly the best iPad ever made its designers incredible the performances like second to none but at the end of the day it's still an iPad and it probably won't quite replace your laptop just yet until you desire yeah it's very light industrial is very iPhone 5 just kind of stretched out and you can feel the fingerprint cuz I've been using just like all day everyday since I got it already thin you can just kind of looking around apple pencil with his cool and go to the engraving on my not going to say that so you don't have to do that annoying hair sticking out the side that you did with the previous models of iPad Pro apart from that ready like yeah that's all there is to say it's pretty nice screen is going off apple pencil and this Smart Keyboard folio thing is pretty good I'll do a dedicated read about this cuz I actually love this thing I think get one of these but it's it's it's not going to replace your laptop and I'm doing a whole video where I talked about this in-depth and to be honest nothing has really changed there is nothing ready that you can do on this iPad that you couldn't do on the previous generations of the iPad and therefore if we're asking the does the iPad Pro replace your laptop the answer is still probably not with a few caveats but you can watch my video that will be linked up there for a bit more information on that point I deliberately haven't touched on the specifications or like another geekbench scores and all that stuff daily contrapoints on his review of the iPad Pro is very good I like it. He points out that when was the last time your iPad felt so my iPad Pro in my iPad Air 2 before that never really felt slow to speed yes it doesn't my brief overall Impressions and let's not talk about who should buy the new iPad Pro pay so I'm going to structure this bit of the video as a mini flowchart like an algorithm if you will that you can follow to decide whether you should buy the new this flowchart is do you have a previous generation iPad Pro because if you do then you probably should not buy the new iPad Pro 2018 I did a few weeks ago I introduced a different framework to decide whether a piece of technology is worth it subjectively questionable one of my list was doesn't make me any happier and they also for this iPad has no opening. New tech never makes us happy unless it fulfills 20.3 of this other three-part framework phone number to was does it remove any Salient negatives from my life does having this new piece of tech stop me from feeling pain in one aspect of my life and sort of this new one does the fact that the pencil magnetically remove a mess of annoyance because with the old generation you have to like stick it into the side and charge it like that and like a possum. Ready there were no real Salient negatives of the old 2017 iPad Pro or I think of previous generations old drop volume II negative. I don't think anyone was complaining about how bad their iPad Pro was before for them to Warrant justifying purchase of a much more expensive new 2018 iPad Pro allow me to do o make or create anything that would add more value to my life and again for this new iPad Pro is no because it has exactly the same capabilities as the previous iPad Pro iPad Pro additional value from the new one apart from the fact that the screen is slightly nicer and the pencil sticks on which is kind of cool and you got to show up to your friends that you for the latest iPad Pro so if you have an old iPad Pro it's really hard to recommend it's just so expensive that 719 lb that's how you buy AppleCare on top of that for another hundred and something pounds and then the pencil that comes out to over a thousand pounds just for the base 64 gigabyte model pounds to upgrade an already very very very very good iPad it's just really really not worth it in my opinion okay so that's how you don't have an existing iPad Pro do I have the 2018 iPad with apple pencil that is the student from the iPod it starts at three hundred and something pounds with AppleCare on the apple pencil at overall the cost is about 450 lb and you get a little bit off if you're a student for the student discount so you're comparing the 400 lb of the normal iPad with Apple another pencil with the 1100 lb of the iPad Pro with apple pencil excluding the keyboard if you want to keep one another like 200 lb what's the normal iPad with apple pencil that's aimed at students and if you're a student then it's again it's really really hard to recommend this it's just so so so expensive compared to what you get for it the 2018 normal iPad with apple pencil is is great looks very nice a admittedly yes the writing experience of the apple pencil is very slightly nicer on the iPad Pro Models because of the reduce screen distance and increase hundred 20 Hertz refresh rate the other than that you know it's such a minor thing that you weren't ready notice unless you've seen two devices side by side if you have a 2018 iPad is it say it again so so hard to recommend buying the new iPad Pro that's so much more you could be doing with that money instead you know 600-lb is the difference in price between the iPad Pro the 600-pound you can buy a Sony a6000 mirrorless camera with luck you have photos of your friends and family and you know your experiences with that you'll be looking back on in many years time and thinking while I'm so glad I've got these photos and actually this has been one of the most I probably the single most valuable purchase in my life Sony a6000 absolutely priceless probably the second most beautiful places I've ever made other than the camera I set you back about 90 pounds for the Kindle Paperwhite let you know if the user experience of the iPad Pro alternative to audible audiobooks think that if you want us about eight times a month you can get like five years worth of an audible subscription with a free audiobook every month for the 600 pounds that you be paying upgrade to the iPad Pro over the 2018 iPad and tablet ever made in my life I'm going to do it like a whole list of this and a video and Anna book cuz I'm tired but you know the upgrade the incremental between the 2018 iPad and the 2018 iPad Pro in my opinion does not justify that 600-lb the 2017 iPad Pro with the 2018 iPad cost when I made that video I made the point that I would still personally prefer the pro because I meant I said something about spreading the extra cost over 3 years if you think about it 600 pounds over three years that's about 1 pound a week and I'm happy to pay one pound a week for the slightly nicer experience of the iPad but actually own reflection that was one very important point that I didn't touch on in that video and that brings us to point number three in our three-part flowchart is if you don't have an iPad Pro already the previous model and you don't have the 2018. the question you want to be asking yourself in my opinion before buying this is do you have the cash to burn now I'm going to talk a little bit about money about money then for life but when to spend upwards of a thousand pounds in one of these when you could spend 400 pounds on a normal iPad that's just as good pretty much we really do need to talk about money and to speak candidly about what money means to different people and I think the most important question here is is that 1,000 lb a significant amount of money to you this is going to vary for different people on Tina there's no judgment here for some people a thousand pounds is a head of lot of money and it is ahead of love money but other people including myself admittedly a thousand pounds is a lot of money but it's not a significant amount the sense that it's not going to change the way I live my life if I didn't have that thousand pounds or if I chose to spend a thousand pounds on this device and the reason that question is important is because the iPad Pro is less a functional tool and more luxury so when you splashing out so much money on a luxury product it's it's hard to convince yourself that you're doing it for a functional purpose for the for the most part. people by doubt this is what the people watching this video I'm watching for the most part if you watching this video you're probably a student you're probably on some kind of budget and you're considering whether to buy an iPad Pro or whether to buy an iPad a total of maybe going for surface that you know gets you the best of both worlds an avocado or whatever we just need to answer that question is a thousand pounds a significant amount of money a few years ago when I was a student and I didn't have my side business Cano generating income every year I would never have ever ever have bought this I spent like year of my life saving up 700 pounds to buy the MacBook Air in like 2012 I was tutoring four times a week making about 20 pounds an hour and by the end of the year amounted to save 700 pounds for a MacBook Air last three years and it had an immense amount of value to my life and I'm really glad but would I have saved you know what I've worked an extra whole year to buy a MacBook Pro the 1400 lb back in the day no it was not because I didn't need a Macbook Pro I was quite content and I could do every single thing I wanted to on the base model of the MacBook Air I think it's a similar situation for this iPad versus the iPad Pro the 2018 iPad is great do you need to have as a student because if you have seen my previous video about taking notes on an iPad might want to become paperless with your note-taking and I think it is good the potential to genuinely make you a better student if you have an iPad that has apple pencil support cuz the apple pencil is just absolutely incredible because the jump from the normal iPad to the 23rd can iPad Pro the extra 600 the price difference is just so so hard to justify as a student if however you're in the position where a thousand pounds is not that significant amount of money then yeah is the money even if it's not significant but it's if that money is not really going to change your life that much if it's an amount of money that you'd be happy to Splash out on a luxury product then by all means you should buy it we talked about Overland prescience you out of this is the best iPad ever made but it's still not a laptop replacement the incredible Hardware that is hampered by the limitations of iOS 12 as every other type of incredible device but it's really really really bloody expensive that concludes this random review thing"

Com found the reading bill. fiction in particular had a much more varied and deeper vocabulary than those who read non-fiction books reading fiction expands of an ocular more than reading nonfiction does but we will do some studies that show functional MRI scanning that different parts of our brain light up when we're eating different sorts of fiction mystery from 2013 for example that shows that when we read fiction we get the lighting up of a left temporal cortex which of the bed the brain that deals with language that's not surprising. I showed that if your weed was like lavender perfume and coffee. Like reading those words like love the smell regions of the brain which is kind of cool and we got the story from France that shows that if you read about two different motor activities at lights of different pots so I'll eat through the cats would light up a different part of the brain and how they kicked the top because they're too kind of different action that's kind of cool as well so does that show that reading picking is good for us well no not directly but it does show that when we read we are also lighting of different parts of other than just a bit of the brain that process language Okay so we've established that reading fiction is good for empathy and it's good for language development but did you know reading fiction is also good for health in general history from the University of Sussex in the UK for example showed that reading fiction is reducing stress levels than going for a walk listening to music while playing video games they said in the paper that reading for as little as six minutes is sufficient to reduce stress levels by 60% slowing heartbeat easing muscle tension in altering the state of mind what does that mean they also showed that reading before bed helps improve the quality of sleep so that's another plus point for reading but there is some evidence that reading over the long-term helps reduce our cognitive decline as we age and might potentially even slow down the Dubai disorders like dementia and Alzheimer's disease history from 2011 for example says that being engaged in more reading and healthy activities and spending more time each week reading is associated with the lowest subsequent risk of instant dementia again this is just a correlation or causation but how to cool a fact we didn't go on NHS page that answer the question with a lifelong reading could protect against dementia that will do these two these cannot provide conclusive proof the greater cognitive activity directly prevents development regular reading could be helpful and it recommends to pick up a library card do in my case it Kindle and audible subscription sponsored Link in the description so what does all this mean for my reading habits well to be honest I am reading fiction I'm not activity be productive but I do like it when the stuff that I do for fun also has some sort of benefit of the long-run so who knows maybe I'll pick up a Playstation stop playing video games and do a video about that about I just having a balance I always say if the only thing I did in my life was read fiction I'd ever get anything else done I think reading fiction a listing to help me wind down and help me relax video click here to check out the book club series that little playlist of Anna videos where I talked about insides from poking infection but I do want to read fiction then I'm going to recommend you check out some fantasy books and here is a video with my three favorite fantasy series of all time"

            "text": " add and the apple pencil internal structure is videos going to split up into three parts in the first part I meant talk about why I use the iPad Apple has like a hybrid method of note-taking versus handwriting were talking about that I use and why exactly how I take notes in lectures at if I have a Honda and various different use cases and I'll show you how I use this explain why are you able to take notes the reason I use the iPad and apple pencil is because I think both these methods have the disadvantages on the iPad and apple pencil method combines the advantages of both and so is quite good because you're nuts that increases retention Versa talking them up I win you hand write a note so you can kind of categorize the topic into spider diagrams you can use different colors you can throw arrows you can throw boxes you can do all these things that mean that you're processing more of the lecture and Distilling it into important is quite slowly means you have to be selective in what you put. Which means you're more inclined to this still actually use your brain to make the notes of a Sadie disadvantage of handwriting that you end up with Reams and reams of paper friends yeah the cloud to find you could go through and grab your ring binder file from a bookshelf you cut open a few could find the right page and just very cumbersome to deal with handwritten notes kind of in the longtime Solstice problem of accessibility everything go in one place everything is synced across all your different devices but I find it especially if you could quite a fast typing speed and I'm imagining what you watching this video will because we've all grown up with computers transcribe lecturer saying and you don't end up not really taking my chance I used to do this in faster and I find that I make a perfect copy of what set including older and idiosyncrasies of the unzen be kind of a little bit of prose a few bullet points a bit Pros for few but it went something to do like to look for the lecture notes and to add stuff to it just a bit Bland that's why I didn't write like typing up stuff The Best of Both Worlds with handwriting like you hand write your notes on the after I use notability also have all the surgeon sing functionalities that make typing notes really effective always leave the main disadvantage of expensive have apple pencil support out of Del Sol some of the problems caused about half the price of the iPad Pro but if you're a student and you've got a very tight budget and then this is probably going to be the most limiting factor the price this video because hopefully I'll be giving you some tips on how I use notability take notes in various different areas so which iPad the iPad Pro as of today Gabapentin support I bought it last year but Apple recently released the 2018 iPad as well which has apple pencil support and is about half the price of the iPad Pro difference between iPad Pro and the iPad is that the pro is slightly more powerful and the pro has a slightly decreased distance between screen or like the screen in the thing so that it feels a little bit more like you're writing on paper where is with the 2018 iPad you have a little bit of a gap almost videos are awesome on YouTube say that you don't really notice this gap for the 2018 iPad unless you're like a digital artist so if you just buy an iPad to take notes in school or university I'd probably recommend the 2018 iPad rather than the 2017 iPad Pro but I'm going to borrow one of my friends expedite the process now what app do I use that uses your laptop or desktop the problem of notability is that it's not available on Windows when using Windows he's probably use something like one that I've heard very good things about 1 and 1/2 Windows is very powerful one for my kids let's go. is that give you a good structure to structure units and so you can't divide us and you got within divided you get subject so depending on the course depending on how you want to organize things that's quite an intuitive what is the oldest and then subject within the Village Drive in Dropbox so because all of my life is on Google Drive and I want to import PDF is very easy to import spring into notability from Google Drive just click the input button and you can put it directly from Google Drive the PDF if I'm scanning something like a document on my iPhone using scannable the app I can convert that to PDF an advocate to my iPad open Strava notability Odyssey Ms person from getting notes in real life or in PDF format into notability is because notability restricts you to writing on pages the problem is that it gives you like an infinite horizontal and vertical canvas which means your notes can span like a huge amount of space and that does have its uses but I think because we're all used to write I think the fighting ability limits you to writing in different pages is ready helpful because it kind of forces you to going to stick to this a full-size page of writing stuff but it's more helpful if you want to share your notes and sharing a friend of mine also my notes all I have to do is exposed as a PDF and I can send it to them where is when I used to try and share OneNote drive you have to share the link to the Bourne Drive thing I would never work and if you try to export to PDF you end up with this really weird shaped PDF like many of the other apps the one that tried a OneNote to notability an Evernote and after 3 I love notability the most like goodnotes and stuff like that but the other ones that if you really want to shop for more what the weather looks to me and that's what to me for the last like foyet is notability and I'm not really look back through some of these cases that I find and how I use notability to take notes into these cases idly wannabe pre-reading the lectionary to the slides to get an idea of what the broad subheading door and then we can kind of read those subheadings downright the top of myself even though it should black mold detector is happening with taking us to a couple weeks ago we had a revision lecture for radiology that I am going to show you and I think that I destroyed some of these stuff looks like arrows you can like other things and you can use the highlights of things of that helps how to find a fortify connections varies. But if I'm taking out that I'm focused on a I'm standing with electric talking about and beam distilling it into decent note format that engages my brain enough to keep me awake an image of a subject was putting up chest x-rays and stuff on the PowerPoint I was kind of getting my iPad up taking a photo of it and then putting it into internet quite a few chest x-rays can we put the meditations we've got some some highlighting that I'm done and I wanted to I could like drawing more books are then you can give basically do anything after you done with the name age you can like move it around you can crop it and pretty as well so that's what happens in lectures to have power points we had a class yesterday we had a Honda instead it was like a small groups that were working through the handout I don't like time that the toll because I lose them or they get like paper I've gone completely paperless so what I did is I use my phone I use the scannable app that you can get for free on the phone to Scott the Little Bits of Paper open it up and ability this is what it looks like then I added the the PDF. It sounded so as you can see there's some questions here and I was able to annotate in real life especially in clinical scenario so let's say I'm observing a consultation and I would like making you notes and let's say they're talking about they mentioned the phrase that they've got Epstein's anomaly so I would write this down in my notes and I would think I can type in ebstein's anomaly and then I got the results I'm just kind of selected on the iPad you can drag-and-drop text I like highlights stuff I can like change the color Android picture in this room there is so much better than getting your phone out because if you have that looks a little professional looks a lot more the jet rather than getting it for now so that's another reason why I really like using tablets in in the workplace environment annotating PDFs of Books store very PDF if I were to download PDFs of medical textbooks rather than by the 50lb versions of them in them and I'm not ruining it I can always come to rub them out if I have to but it's just a very easy way of getting loaded textbook onto your on your system reading through them highlighting undertaken thing whatever you want how to read music so I downloaded the sheet music and I have it like in a sheet music folder organized by in a classical POP Disney music from musicals that's got some Sound of Music Climb Every Mountain and all this stuff ways to download the sea sheet music online and has PDF and actually one of the songs that I'm learning is Jarrod radnich version of Pirates of the Caribbean and because I'm not regular reading music I've been able to annotate stuff using a disability so I can like right now write down the name of the clothing that helps me kind of life in general so I would just going to make me do commit about it this is the one that I made about this very video 24th of February 2018 apparently and I had this sort of idea of what I would make what I was saying the video and have extended that overtime and the reason I like handwriting notes is that where I was putting a plan for a YouTube video together by liking a writing stuff down doing arrows and doing boxes and making it look pretty in Courage is me to actually do it and I think that alone is worth having a pet for if it encourages you to improve take notes about your general ideas send him speak about which iPad recommended probably the budget 2018 one that does have apple pencil support but I've got more detail video comparing the iPad Pro and the 2018 iPad coming up at some point soon unless you have a Windows computer wonder it has probably some of the features and we talked about a couple of use cases like an electric hand out in clinical scenarios a sheet music General ideas annotating PDFs of books over that stuff I use it all the time in my study with me videos so I hope this is giving you some insight into that if you haven't subscribed"

African beauty YouTuber and they're using the new memoji feature to talk to each other I think everyone a little bit weird and then Craig comes back on to talk about iPad OS and while he's dead Enterprise he right there so I should not allow the first time I saw that a running joke amongst developers about enterprise software Enterprise apps and Enterprise abscess in his being these like bloated pieces of software that were made decades ago that Enterprise has a big companies pay obscene amounts of money for when you hear enterprise software you tend to think of Microsoft or like Oracle or Salesforce Elise on big companies are making very very expensive piece of software that are used by the is kind of giving a note to that culture of making fun of Enterprise E Enterprises stuff by saying that too much was windows are oh that's enterprising display xdr presentations as soon as you can hear the the outrage in the audience when everyone and then he kind of flounder little bit of presentation but instead use Google these people you're looking at what the hell can you tell us a thousand dollars from us about hashtags iTunes and everything it can do but if there's one thing we hear over and over it's even more appointments and your best tracks right in 1 hour my Queen Creek nail that was pretty great because Craig is poking fun at Apple at themselves for how bad our genes is like it's been a frustration for is anyone using Mac OS the iTunes update terrible it tries to do too many things at fault too bloated and it's good that they don't take themselves too seriously. The able to laugh at themselves before announcing the doctor going to split up into three different apps which is met with a round of applause although In fairness everything I say is met with Raju close to maybe that's not quite a prognostic factor for how good feature is again he doing the classic crank thing of poking fun at Apple Waddles are not playing any features some very odd reason they invite to people who from the from the Minecraft team to come and demo the augmented reality version of Minecraft which is very very weird and sold at like killing chickens and stuff and it's it's a little bit but then cry comes back on and Trust added to the mix no chickens were harmed which is a feature for developers that makes it a lot easier to actually build apps and now we're ready to choose the next name for Macos let's try one more cute animals seems promising other Apple Frameworks to use the new reality kit framework to Envision the release of Macos 10 flying squirrel and it looks like it's going to be amazing and that's a quick look at has done really well amongst the volume developers cuz I actually is genuinely like an incredible feature that you can do all these new things with Swifty y instead of going with like some lame example day went for fun but what you might actually enjoy it my top 5 highlights from WWDC and another one right talk about my favorite new features coming to iPad OS I think maybe over half of the funny bits of his keynote came from him but I think the joke of the has to go to the guy Kevin Wright the star who made that joke about the rubbing on here that is again text Leah Robin captured Apple Park I mean was recorded at Le Parc the robins are okay alright so thank you so much watching this video I have you found it vaguely entertaining I said enjoyed making those looking to clean out had this idea that going to be returning to our regularly scheduled programming or I make videos about medicine Tech education productivity that sort of stuff so most up coming soon if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed"

            "text": " I got something back to the channel if you need my name is Ali I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is the third installment in our monthly series called monthly favorites where each month I talk to you about my favorite books podcast article stuff I've discovered that month that I want to share with you guys were taking a little break from recent space of study and revision theme videos of repair of the channel to as usual everything I'm going to talk about is going to be * * paranormal romance genre type series of books about an article that I read recently about like friendship and relationships and if you're interested going to talk to you about a YouTuber that I recently discovered called Matt d'avella he's a minimalistic filmmaker podcaster and he's gone Amazing YouTube channel that such a production value videos and has been a real inspiration to me newest biography quotes the whole Magic thing and divisions are a bit better because it's a little bit more real and away when you've got like some evil vampire going off to you rather than in my Fifty Shades of Grey where you got her psycho ex-boyfriend unitronic stabbed with a knife you get worth in paranormal romance you got very realistic Frets like vampires and werewolves and stuff dirty nice thing about the size changing series by nalini Singh Is that each book follows a different character but it's all part of the story so like in the first book you get introduced to Sasha and Lucas and Hunt but you got like Faith involved in each book has like a different power to who has the run to the love store and gets together with someone else but like they all combined in a way that each book references the previous ones and you kind of get glimpses of the cartoons that you love in the previous books absolutely love about this particular series is that because each book has its own. Love Story kind of like, the whole book is almost focused around them getting together and then when they do get together at the end and a new bookstore get to See Another Love Story from the beginning and kind of like the exciting opening stages some people would argue that this Obsession that our society has on the opening stages of love stories in films and books means that we roll hyper romanticized and wheel stages of a relationship and not enough at all and what happens later you know the pain the argument scene of looking after the kids what type of gloss we want to buy from Ikea what color the sofa conveyed that stuff gets relegated to stuff that we don't hear much about because obviously Winston is the excitement of the initial Chase uniform with him I think it's sort of bad that Society focuses on light all of this media old books or movies focus on the opening stages of relationship but to be honest relationship and I think the fact that all these look focus on the opening stage of the relationship is what makes him so exciting to read so active in 2017 and read about 10 of them while electrical just couldn't put them. They just so good the part of the relevant because the fact that the love story the most important thing in this world you have three races Bears fishing stuff like that humans who are just ordinary humans and this is kind of about the Dynamics in the politics of these three different races so you could decide who are like did the ruling Elite who like or like proper educated and speak very cost lots of a sort of subjugate the rest of the of the races and they think that changing the beneath them of that humans are just pointless cuz they don't have any special powers stop them from going mad they've had to erase all emotion and they've become solid with a capital S and that means that no size allowed to experience emotion and they get emotion conditioned out of them at a very young age due to pain and so when you get particular members of the you are starting to feel some kind of emotions then they have to put a break away from their race and that's the kind of story of the first two books it follows some Cardinal Simon brosseau like to have like really really strong powers experiencing emotions and how to stop flooding in the oven. But the whole the whole series of 16 books so far is set on this idea of some sort of a war between the three races and then you get some cooperation because you know SI mates with a changeling a changing mat to the human human falls in love with book a crisis really nice meshwork of interrelationships and alliances and combat and it's really good is Stephanie check it out on Eric Barker blog it's called walking up the wrong tree blog it's a really really really good dog has a crack in the newsletter and it's one of the few email newsletter that I get that actually open and read because there's just a lot of value in the writing so one of them might be five ways to a five scientifically proven methods to increase your happiness or for scientifically proven ways to become closer to your friends the article that I read most recently is about relationships I don't like the Romantic relationships just kind of relationship and opposes the idea that relationships are essentially an exchange where one party makes a bid for attention to the other policy and the other party kind of response to that bed that sounds a bit weird but bear with me and you always yelling the article here in Denver that you can read it for yourself you should it's pretty good and he probably explains it better than I can I'll look the weather's nice there are three ways you can you can respond to it you can either accept the bid you can be like oh yeah you can reject it you can get it today or you can just kind of ignore three ways of responding to a bed accept reject or ignore and his his his. This is not the most successful relationships friendships narges whatever the ratio of number of its two number of a cup is the highest I think he's had some studies that show that looked at soda married couples in like really long successful relationships and that it was like quite a high ratio in the general conversation of bits to accepted beds like no one would make a comment about the weather or but outside and the other one doesn't really count as a bird outside but you know because some of the time especially women in relationships with people that I'm very close to like my mom and my grandma I find that they often make these seemingly pointless statements like doing some work would make some comment about you know some shopping she's do or like something that was on TV and and previously are seriously think that that you know it was just a comment just made for the sake of it and I don't like a comment like oh look he Bronson TV maybe doesn't quite warrant a response for me because he's on the TV but like having seeing this relationships being an exchange of bedside now try my very best to respond to these bit more because I obviously their conversations happen and like I sometimes think that if we were chilling in my room with my University friends and which be like I look cute on some TV or hear us use your bright like that wheel would respond to it and like a normal way and I think sometimes relationships with their parents very close to us we sometimes don't necessarily put in the effort that we would with our friends or people we want to get to know better because we just kind of assumed we just kind of assumed this. Oh you know that my mom when she said something unipony bungie.net friends but if you're in that position where you feel like maybe you know your conversations with your parents all of the same formula that's what I'm saying or he know what you doing school work because this because the series is very specifically aimed at out of me talking about stuff that I find interesting I'm trying not to overly worried about you know maybe like whether other people will find interesting enough but if not then I'm personally trying to be like you know what it doesn't matter at least I've kind of how subscribe to the news that check cuz it's like they know anybody good content pretty much every week about is a YouTuber called Nasty Bella he is a filmmaker best known for the documentary that was on Netflix called minimalism at some point after exam some kind of saving it up is my and exam Street interviews people a creative people people what YouTubers and autistic musicians of stuff about how they got started it's a school the ground up show so the ideas you know how you got started how you grew your your thing and how you made a big fuss the reason that I find that very very inspirational is because he started with 0 he started with your subscribers on YouTube and that's something that a big kind of barrier to entry for a lot of people and certainly wasn't me cuz I was thinking that all you know is he the best time to get involved in YouTube was in like 2010 back when there was no much people around obviously too oversaturated did the actually the way he can set himself apart from the crowd just by being a pretty consistent with his uploads and just producing high-quality contact but secondly by producing it very very well like he's got fancy cameras he's done this for years and years the quality of this video production value is so so so high absolutely beautiful like and post oldies like hour-and-a-half-long podcasts on YouTube along with on his actual podcast so you got the option of listening to her in the car at the gym or whatever but you'll have the option of watching on YouTube I think the fact that he's done video with this so well it just makes it an absolute pleasure to watch I realize that that's kind of what I would like to go with this channel like filming in such high quality hopefully microphone and you can feel anything with even though iPhone getting a lighting setups hopefully making a high production value for these videos and one thing that I really appreciated about his channel was was the high production value and a few things from him he's got really good contact as well and he just followed the formula of good production Value Plus good content plus consistency and in the last two months his say his channel to explode in popularity and it seems to have been an overnight success but obviously as a at the movies podcast none of these things are an overnight success obviously he's been working as a filmmaker for the last like 10 plus years building up all this experience so now that would that he's going to YouTube and put in the work put in the hustle consistently done it now he's getting he's getting results Channel generally very inspirational it's all about building stuff from the ground up so if you're into this whole thing maybe not necessarily YouTube just any kind of Kratos fear maybe you're like a painter on the side or I cannot if you draw stuff you write poetry and you want to kind of get it out into the world probably that and you don't really sure yeah how to do it then if channel is a source of inspiration of the podcast already interesting I start listen to them in the car and would highly recommend briefly talked to you about Anna Kendrick latest autobiography biography from Leah's she's like . cup song that went big a few years ago many years ago actually in the book she talks about kind of her childhood and talks about moving to LA and becoming an actress and like auditioning for lots of things and eventually she the big with with Pitch Perfect and then she becomes kind of a celebrity and she talks about the challenges of a feeling of being the whole thing of having to go to additions and lucky you make your big break just talks about the struggles of being a woman in in the sphere which I found one of the things she says she makes a point that everyone says she's very nice if you if you should get the van coming up to her then tiny trucks with them like if I met Brad Pitt on the street contraction that that specially for women this whole thing of being nice a it's because you know it's nice to be able to say that she's nice but they don't have anything to base that on minor infraction and save this this label of nice any kind of situation where you're having to assert yourself in order to fight for fight for your rights or anything like that I just have to lose this label of a nice and and for women she says yoga the opposite of nice is pitch and therefore like as soon as you become not nice your phone into this realm of difficulty the bed of a b**** in that other thing just makes the point that in her kind of all acting career 90% of difficult people or people who have created false and created the kind of oldies requirements for them everything 90% of them have been men but 90% of people who have had the label difficult applied to them have been women so you make the point that being amount of these situations a lot you can definitely get away with a lot more as a man in these situations without it reflecting poorly on your own personality your own kind of self-worth if you're a woman and you kind of have the audacity to float the boat look at you become labeled at the scene of a debate or is difficult and mental to get label that sucks you know if a man is assertive assertive or whatever what you want me as a guy I don't really have much exposure to real talk from women took me about what it's like to be a woman different hearing it from someone who a lot like everyone wants to be famous be a celebrity you like other people's dreams has to be an actor or a big YouTuber myself included. tea culture in a way and what it's like on the inside being established a thing wheel idolize celebrity Lots Levin surveys where are your kids what they want to be and they reply with I want a famous I just thought it was it was it was very hearing about and how she's told us again to address any issues and you know she can walk all night and then as soon as you got home she just like kind of class in the bed of the connect I told you about how I quit celebrity culture and with things like the Oscar the Golden Globes and stuff I would say what the media portrays we see on TV is very different it's a very kind of reptile packaged a brushed version of reality and kind of what you get behind the scenes as a lot more struggle a lot more pain no more drama and it was it was it interesting getting that prospective cuz with the exception of Derren Brown happy where he talks about what it's like being a celebrity about who plays Joffrey who played Joffrey in Game of Thrones he gave it to look at the Oxford Union a few years ago when I say that he wrote about what it's like to be famous and he gave a real a really kind of damning indictment of a baby I think reading the book it was quite funny very well written right he did follow be at all these interesting insights about what it's like to be a woman and what it's like to be an actress what it's like to be a celebrity and I found it in my perspective I wasn't expecting to enjoy it you know I did I came across and like one of the airport's Shelton was Anna Kendrick. Maybe kind of cool go to my perspective of life and yeah if you go to spare time and take me a few hours on plane to finish it are we talked about this I changing paranormal romance series books how to change the way that I viewed relationships with my with my parents and other people that repost me who's a YouTuber that has inspired me a lot with his life value really be content. I will be looking down in description below that you can check out for yourself if you like so yeah and I will talk about it and I don't know what them people say that you know you shouldn't care what other people think the Unites definitely love to be set for that so yeah either way I enjoy it if you like the video"

            "text": " everyone welcome back to the peanut tip series my name is Eliana 50 American Ambridge and this video we're going to be talking about the approach to section 2 chemistry from the biology section 2 content timing and practice apply to section 2 chemistry 12 in the very briefly but I want to spend the rest of this video talking about specific tactics and more about what makes a chemistry question in particular quite hard you understand something BBC Bitesize is quite a good results and wheels have nose on if you want to check this out video talking about chemistry calculations with efficiency let's not talk about the types of questions that you get in chemistry the chemistry questions can be broadly divided into two main categories both of which have their problems and difficulties video at the end of this month questions are ones that ask you to remember for example that graphite has 3 electrons are friends of reactivity of an atom group 174 what color Universal indicator paper electronic configuration for response to that sort of thing don't worry you don't have to memorize the periodic table in fact if you ever need a periodic table to answer question one will be provided just the next to the question the questions in such a chemistry GCSE or O-level standard is practically everyone taking the GMAT does a level chemistry you shouldn't have too much problem with the factory for component of the chemistry syllabus but having said that is quite hard and there are some graduate students I'm your best bet is probably just to memorize as much of the section 2 assumes knowledge guide as you possibly can. He was no shortcut to this thing could literally anything they want so memorizing the guy is actually this isn't just useful for the vena chemistry the better you'll probably do in your exams or IV or whatever they use these days right so that's the factual Rico questions the way to get good at those is to memorize as much of the section 2 assumes knowledge guide as you can and I know that's easier said than done but hey it's trying anyway they should definitely check that one out because it's very much of full of on this video so let's conclude this video for now we talked very briefly on contents Mining and how to practice and we talked about the fact questions about how doing well on those is unfortunately a matter of just memorizing as much a baby so thank you very much for watching"

I'm supposed to be learning from his wisdom and actually when he came over to my place the other day he and I spent three hours discussing ounces to various questions that people sent him by Instagram / likes to revision and study tips and I'll be uploading the next few weeks but if you want to see them right now find them on nebula which of the streaming service is Simon and I are both helping to build nebula spotted with curiositystream Horry County sponsoring this video free access to all the videos about that at the end of the video tape number one the space petition diary and slap two words into ten-year-old Simons head they would be spaced repetition I cannot stress enough how important this technique is spaced repetition is all about resetting the forgetting curve and 18 the scientist called ebbinghaus discovered that if you memorize basically anything your memory for that will just BK exponentially over time that's why we can read something in a textbook in single you understand it but if we come back to it a week later it will find that it's probably completely gone if you interrupt forgetting curve by revising the top of the next day that she takes you longer to forget it again and then if you were by the week later for example it takes you longer still and by the time you've done this a handful of times I eat you repeated the topic at spaced intervals over time it's pretty lucky to be in your lungs racing unlikely to ever forget it so how do we do this well I've got my own patented retrospective revision timetable Series in the video description but Simon actually has its own role the interesting method for doing the same thing Mike Thacker I think the reason for it was Isis technique I think I for today and write down that talk again before we write that topic for the month and then Vision you gradually populated diary with the revision that you needed to go back and look at on it do you get to say May 14th and you would say right well I no need to revise this PilotOnline physics of the stuff that you had to look forward to in your provision plan and it meant everything several times at these increasing intervals and it just stayed in my head so much so if we using slime with method we'd get to anyone date and we already have a pre pump a list of all the topics that we need to study on that date based on a spaced repetition intervals bees which I could work out the library open up my diary and say right what's today is the 14th of May made life so much easier and so much better because of it to better results in less time I would place a large amount of money on a bat. I would have done better eating if I have done more extracurricular activities I think one of the biggest problems I had was that I let my work expands to fill the time available which was old a I think if I am going to run has like tennis session vicious I had a second everyday app for that meant that I had to go to the morning and then I had four hours from 12 to get with my website and it meant that I had to ask and get this stuff done in that time chunk and then go to go to tennis and constraining the work I think would have made me so much more focused Robin just like we can take our time with this Parkinson's law and that's the idea that work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it I noticed this in my life pretty much everyday like if I'm off work and I set myself a goal of filling just one video in the day I will procrastinate I'll do anything else until 9 p.m. when then bring myself to fill my video but if I set myself the goal of building safety videos in the day and only give myself an hour for each one I end up getting most of them done I know so I have more fun making videos depression actually get good work done first, counterproductive seemingly step off saying actually know I'm going to dedicate these hours to definitely not working that's my deadline and then just stick to it make studying great again to actually study if you're doing so in a way that is just unpleasant I'm a huge fan of making studying and more pleasant things to do at libraries and coffee shops I'll tell myself that because I'm studying and being productive feel guilty buying that's like 5 lattes for the day. Just make something more pleasant which means I'm more likely to do it and send me the link option play my Spotify study with me playlist through my airpods are headphones Link in the description if you want to check it out and Yeah. Simon says the evidence is probably Hollywood music on your efficiency but for me personally I'm more than happy to take the helm my efficiency because it means that I've got Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter Bangles playing through my ears and making me feel like an absolute Legend while studying and I just make it more pleasant which makes me more likely to ask minimize pains if you want to study strategies tips for memorizing content tips for understanding content how to do well in math and physics exam which is a streaming platform helping to build if you don't have an able account you should definitely sign up for trial of curiosity stream Hillsborough County sponsoring this video and because Carol Stream and nebulae are friends it means that if you have a curiositystream account you will get free access to all of the stuff of nebula including all of this religion stuff all the videos in my own workflow Series where I cannot deep dive into my favorite productivity apps that's in the plug take care of yourself I made a lot of mistakes not taking better care of myself and I feel like it's the one aspect when you're putting together a study plan that just get label loves you like I do this many hours in a day off the finishing lectures and such and such incredibly counterproductive to do that because it just ignores the fact that you are a pi logical system that requires maintenance and it requires down time and you know you actually have to look after this this body that you accounting rain around is 11 good thing only in the brain is going to go into this many hours of work in the brain is going to do that I have to be realistic and saying yeah I need a couple of hours a week just reading a book or going to the cinema or playing video games whatever it is individual and it should be shouldn't look at what other people do and say what I need that much free time as much time as you need in order to keep your brain functioning when my friends and I were preparing for a final year Medical School exams we had this great system whereby during the day time we'd be studying either by ourselves or in a group but then most evenings for a few hours we would get together usually my room because my room had an open-door policy order pizza or sushi and we play board games for a few hours like I've alone and I'll take you later after the incredible bowl game played them and then off of that few hours of downtime morning and then we just kind of repeat the process I do this just made it really fun because I meant we were doing our work efficiently and kind of working together as a team but also we have this kind of chill down time to relax in the same way that you might say right and then I'll go to bed late every night get up early and study from the first thing in the morning you wouldn't do say to an Olympian to train absolutely every waking hour of the day in the run-up to the Olympics you would expect them to take some slack time to let that mess time to allow that had to get in the right headspace for the Olympics coming up will for you is your Olympics and you go to make sure that you're in the right frame of mind and in the right condition physically and mentally to do that that's not just knowledge in the techniques it's about where you'll mental health and physical health. You have to be in the right place if you want to do well in your exams hitting the five don't compare your behind the scenes to someone else's highlight reel was that some people would look like they are doing everything incredibly easily and they don't have to spend in the library in the fact is they do they might want you to think music highlight reel Sizzle reel today behind the scenes in real time you didn't see the sexy kind of like Sizzle reel at the end of it The Tao of the People review you so don't compare your real time experience to someone's edited highlights in the same way that when you're at the gym you don't compare your middle to somebody's and will somebody the same time like it's no comparison you are saying things at a different rate of time when you're comparing your studies to somebody else's my friend police to teach medical students while we were at University and he has great story about one of his physiology is any with him as a teacher and there was three students and he asked you not to the group does random Niche question about physiology and one of the kids somehow knew the answer to that and he he saw that the other two were kind of feeling bad that they didn't know the altitude I would like very I knew the answer to this math question and so pull off the guy and how do you know the answer to that and the guys replied with that LOL I'm so far behind the oldies lecture series I was flicking through the next note that I just happened to read that one fact early this morning when I was going through it and I think this is so often when comparing our informants to kind of the performance of our friends around us but I think it's really important to recognize that our friends and colleagues and everyone else is just winging it just as much as we out so that was five top tips for revision from my friends historical stuff down below you should definitely subscribe to YouTube channel his YouTube channel is actually one of the fundamental Inspirations for my own when I discovered a few years ago before starting out on YouTube because I like as soon as I discovered the real kind of him because he was saying he's a bit of a nerd he kind of sounds like I do he enjoys singing he was blogging about her life as a PhD physics student and before seeing Simon's Channel I thought that in order to do well in YouTube you have to have like a loud and you sit personality and be like over the top but Simon did such a great job of creating like full full valuable content that was like a big inspiration for me to stop this YouTube channel so I will be indebted to him for a very long time but yeah that was five of his top tips of studying that discussion you should definitely check out the rest of us series over nebula if you didn't catch any of the video nebula is a streaming platform that Simon and I are helping to build and it's sort of like a YouTube alternative where we can put through the more detailed or what kind of more weird content that mine unnecessary go on YouTube. For example like 3 hours worth of discussions about very study tips probably isn't the sort of thing that would put into YouTube video I am telling to cut them up over time and make individual YouTube videos out of them because that's how the penis works and that's what's good for them but if you want to serious and you care about kind of mining us for order the inside then you should definitely sign of nebula to get access Navy. You should totally sign up for a free trial of curiositystream and then once that's over you can sign up to be subscription which is like $3 a month or $20 a year and I'll give you free access to documentaries on curiositystream which is founded by John Hendricks the founder of the Discovery Channel and curiositystream has documentary from all sorts of things ranging from science technology education lifestyle food logical stuff on top of access to all the videos of nebula including all of these study tips videos of song and I made along with my own workflow series which is why do Deep dive into all my favorite productivity apps including Thomas Frank baby stuff as much as I am I'll put a video over there somewhere that has more revision Q&A stuff with some of my friends met school thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video"

Carrie whole handful of batteries May and there's go in this so that pretty much. ND filters for mavic Pro in here as well does it quite useful at sunglasses for the lenses and a tiny if the candle candle goes in there and do the Bose qc35 cancel always goes idle so my laptop itself is quite easy to just too slow and if you're interested in a bit more funky like this so that squeezes and over that okay where I usually have a gorilla pose but I'm waiting for the switchboard to come out there cuz that's going to be most suitable for that is pretty much everything in my camera bag I'm going to be working on a series of new videos where I explain the behind the scenes of how I make videos like getting over the gear the settings the philosophy around filming and editing and stuff so hopefully that'll be useful for people who are just starting out on YouTube. If you'd like to go to my videos anything that you might like to watch those videos upgrading to set up to be Peak design everyday backpack in the a73 and a few more things that I'll share with you guys at a bit later on but I thought it'd be useful to do this video before because it just gives you an idea of what equipment has been YouTube channel run since 0 subscribers to now 160000 subscribers so camera for the first few months I was using the Sony 98 mm is only about 300 lb random topics you can find it on goodbye"

            "text": " this video is Connie sponsored by skillshare check out the link in the video description to get your 2 month free trial to be honest it doesn't have to be done with an apple pencil you could use any other apple pencil shaped object but because I'm an apple Fanboy I prefer to do it with the apple pencil this is one of my favorite ways to impress people when I'm at work I bust out my iPad Pro magnetically detach the apple pencil from it a few spins hopefully don't drop it and then people do very impressed I've heard as well that this is the sort of thing that really impresses romantic prospects so that's a you want to impress a girl or impress a guy whatever floats your boat spinning around a bit might be you in slow motion how this actually works and then once you get the skill then you can just see the forever so here at the general concept you want you want to have your apple pencil resting with your light in between your thumb and your middle finger is your index finger doesn't really do anything other than provide a bit of support so this is sort of your starting you got some and middle finger of here as such and you've got your index finger sort of on the top providing support and what you doing is that you're applying a forward force with with your thumb so so your thumb is pushing the pencil away from you whereas your middle finger is pulling the pencil towards you and you've got your index finger here acting as a stop for this so is there anyway you got your index and middle finger pushing this way and you got your thumb that way so this is the position that gives you a certain amount of tension then once you want to release that tension what you do is you let your index finger go what you want to do and then eventually we Landing in that same position so you will not pull push towards you with your middle finger so so you're pushing too it's coming towards you and then eventually if you try this enough times you get the knack for it such that the pencil has been able to rotate about your thumb and it kind of runs in the same place so his that again go my index finger providing support middle finger pushing towards me some pushing that way and the pencil is pivoting about my thumb to land in that same position that's pretty much how it works let's now switch to slow mo and we can show this in slow motion all right so we've got this overhead camera which means I can slow it down four times and it'll still look so this is how it works in slow motion I'm not going to weigh my index finger is already doing anything is just providing the initial support if I were to get rid of the index at the index finger it'll probably still work even without the index finger it's the middle finger that's doing all of the work sing it over the thumb okay so few tips on how to make this work first day it's important that one we're holding the apple pencil or whatever other apple pencil we are not holding it in the middle is really hard to do it from the it's it's really hard to do it when your thumb is heard of in the midpoint of the pencil which is why you want your thumb to be slightly on that end of the pencil and then when you spin it around it becomes very easy and you end up catching enable most writing position so your thumb is sort of three-quarters of the way up your index your your middle finger brother is quite close to the middle and then what you're doing is you're just giving it a bit of a push and allowing it to allow you to Tate on the thumb by practice this is how I start off by doing it on a table like eventually you can get to the point where you can start spending it like this in the air but initially you want to have your the back of your hand resting on the table and you just want to try and do thing with you know where you're just pushing with your middle finger and making it rotate about your thumb and you just keep on doing this and it's going to take many many many hundreds of a time until you get the Knock-Knock you'll be able to do it with any handle and you'll be able to do it with any device that you like so it's basically just the same concept and just a middle finger providing a bit of a pushing force and then the pen or pencil or apple pencil rotating about your thumb with some kind of stay still if you watch this back over and over again you'll notice that my thumb doesn't actually move it literally just middle finger pushing something still on pushing with the right amount of force with me that doesn't like fly away but you're pushing with the right amount of force so that eventually and once you've got to pick up an aqua spinning the apple pencil then you can start doing things in the air I just use your ring finger to spin around rather than the middle finger I mean yeah so you can go pinky ring middle middle ring and Pinky finger so that it rotates about the thumb and then you catch it in a riding position and then you going to find yourself doing this every single day many times a day for the rest of your life alright so that was how to spend an apple pencil I have you found this video so many many hours and that one day you leave a comment on this video saying thank you I'm not know how to spend an apple pencil I have been impressing people with that and I've even even managed to attract a spouse by my spinning of my apple pencil or whatever other apple pencil shaped Implement you would like to use the cool thing about the world suspending is that it doesn't stop that once you've learned how to spend an apple pencil you then have a magical power and you can use that magical power to do other sorts of tricks impress people if you wanted to you could even take that same coin and you can use your Apple one as a magic wands to make it disappear if coins don't float your boat you can even use like small objects this is a date that I got for my kitchen for example you can just grab that he's a magic wand and you can make it disappear without any camera tricks involved and ultimately you can get to a point where you don't even need your apple pencil you just be able to take a coin you'll be able to put it would go invisible just like that for that wrap up I just want to say a massive thank you to skillshare for sponsoring this video you probably heard of them skillshare is a massive online things

            "text": " pay friends welcome back to the blog in this episode which was filmed at the end of February 2020 before the coronavirus decided to take over the UK I'm embarking on a quest to create the world best most in-depth online classes how to study for exams the class has just Wauconda sponsoring this video so you can check it out for free by clicking on the link in description if you like but this is behind the scenes of log of how we put it together so the day starts at 8 a.m. when I get up and spending our generally screwing around on my iPad which I made the mistake of parking my bed before going to sleep at 10 past 9 I finally negotiate myself out of bed drop off my Iris smart ring on the charging dock put on my Apple Watch series 4 and head into the shower I end up singing something just like this by Coldplay and The Chainsmokers for like half an hour for some reason nobody sure why then off to changing into semi fresh clothing I'm monthly empty the dishwasher what's the dishes clean the kitchen a bit and make my morning cup of coffee with the Aeropress at 9:30 I procrastinate a bit more by sorting out the living room and sitting up camera ready to film the clock at 10 a.m. minus one of my new team members arrives and we spend some time going over the structure of the cloth and making sure the videos we've already planned make sense within that structure while using the app notion to plan everything as usual DS without list of lessons and juggling things around to try and come up with a structure and eventually we decided to split the cost into three parts firstly how to understand what we're studying secondly how to remember what we're studying and sadly how to maintain motivation and focus for studying 7 a.m. filming begins with videos about how to understand anything would be fun when technique some stuff about active recall of course and then an in-depth discussion about whether and how to take notes during class and after class 7 videos of across the three steps of effective studying understand anything active recall active recall how to take knows how to take notes and scoping the subject Pro Plus monitor microphone rode ntg4 plus I think up here which is hopefully somebody out of frame and then aputure 120d with the space lights ever that Angus over there helping out with the course and then it doesn't take away and then flying back through the rest of these like 20 videos we have to do in the next few hours before the physiology supervision this evening so exciting times set course which is about remembering so 7/1. One will understand step two is remember as a reminder for 3 is focus with a lot more back in the distractions and motivations and procrastination diving into all of the evidence-based tips for remembering / memorizing things but I can just reach right understanding is the most important part I continue filming videos in this vein for the next 45 minutes until lunch arrives from PizzaExpress to motivate myself continue filming these videos I tell myself video one more videos for this rewarding myself with a slice of pizza sometimes two in between each one movie heathens with judge someone is using scissors to cut pizza at 3 p.m. having done another five Elsa videos I take a break to make a cheeky cup of coffee with the Aeropress and then continue doing more and more videos all right so what's the time and we've just this is where we're at so far so we've got how to study for exams McDonald you understand videos you've done most of the remembered videos I've actually just done the video about the peg system which is one of these fancy memory techniques that I used to use in India and I've dug up thanks to Evernote that I wrote in August 2012 this was it just before my first year of University when I decided that I wanted to become a memory champion and become really good at memorizing stuff cuz that's what you do basically like the peg system is about converting numbers into words and so this system means that a one becomes a t or d and to become banana tree becomes and him and this is what I use in my second year of med school to memorize loads of like references to papers that we because that was the way of the time to get a high Mark in essays by showing you had external evidence and that you done why to reading so I go to the papers of the internet that I could put into HSA and then I use this teksystems like memorize what what the reference was like what grateful remember like remembering these random obscure references that I couldn't find my size and the extra spicy bits technique to memorize do they hold us the references but yeah for the cross now I'll do a couple more and take a quick break to eat a bit more pizza and then 5 + about ask and I need to head over to Gus and college which is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge to do my physiology supervision electrolytes like 2 Series which is all about the kidneys for the iPad and so we'll just on the section based around that possession and then I'll drive over to get in college grab some snacks from a petrol station along the way and run the supervision from 6 to 10 p.m. it's really really freaking cold right now we went over basically the kidneys so I 5923 filtration reabsorption and then we talked a little bit about acid-base homeostasis the idea that a single can of Coke contains more hydrogen ions than the entire body put together list five main buffers in the blood and in the kidney filtrate that the body can use to buffer cousin who is visiting the UK from Pakistan and he's going to stay with me for a few days Kabab & Burger store which I'm ashamed to say is like the fifth time this week. I'm getting a chicken wrap from that but hey what can you do we drive home with the chicken wraps in to have a quick chat what is my cousin to their devices while I continue filming the rest of the videos in this class and everything gets wrapped up at around 11:30 p.m. this is the SD card that has an audio in it and this is the SD card that has all the video in it and I'll show you the setup so damn the whole way this is like the extra computer that I have just to upload so I'm going to check the files from the SD card onto the external hard drive then I'll upload them to Google Drive every night so that question matter can get the files in Romania and then he'll be able to have them up today so he's going to work out for him sorry about that question but hey it's got to be done am I right and then also transferring all of these Falls over I set up the air bed in the living room and we call it a day I'm pleased to report this class on how to study for exams is now live on skillshare in total 8/35 videos covering a bass techniques around everything you could want to know about how to study for exam in a structure that hopefully easy-to-follow and hopefully make sense the reason I like putting stuff on skillshare it's amazing for less than $10 a month you get a 50000 of online classes including two of my own and secondly skillshare is very generous and that they put a 2 month free trial in which you can watch as many of the causes of you like including my own so if you are subscribed to skillshare like I am you can click the link in the description to access all of these videos and money plus or if you know yet that you can click the link in the description to sign up to the two month free trial would you can use to watch the cost at a load of others and others I recommend initially on my friend Thomas pranks causes on building your own productivity system and he's got a new one as well about building habits and I found both of these ready anyway that's going to the video hopefully gave you an idea of what the behind-the-scenes process looks like if putting an online course together thank you so much for watching and see you in the next video goodbye"

            "text": " hi everyone welcome back to the wind making an app Siri where Ben and I talked about the process of Designing and building cut and paste or idea for a surgical look book for medical students they were going to be talking about how to build a website in under 5 minutes today is that this is not free text website within about us paid in and everything's this is just a landing page is a page that when you go to the website cut and paste I always get the temptation to spend ages working on the website making it making sure it looks noise making it published something like this the website is pretty second landing page Which is far more important and then we design the city site website using a simple one-page website generator and to be honest anytime I make so many these days I use card to generate initial landing page and then when I want to the Future I'll design a proper website using sketching using other apps that all infusions like the video so they're not think about code is that you just played and it comes with previous will templates everything about them and it doesn't take very long at all so we're taking this one. but I'm using for this is flat UI colors like this website it just has a flat color scheme which is what we're going for here England friendly and welcoming about nothing experimentation Android to iPhone 5c everything so any time these days I want to slap up a quick look good for anything I just find something relatively appropriate and protect do it and that creates a pretty reasonable looking yoga and then in the future at the front of go by like I was redesigned it okay to get something out the door as soon as possible without getting hung up on the details 2 minutes and 45 seconds Hyundai reviews sites don't worry about it and then we can do it at The Amp and now make me some minor tweaks increasing the weight of the email fonts and stuff like that the whole website was done in about 3 minutes about 5 minutes to make what we have to do now is pick up the phone to a military takes over about 30 seconds and then we're done so This Is How We Do It how to use the feature you better have a probe account on called if I do which is $19 a year is very reasonable speed it up what it looks like to read and edit the DNS settings we go cut and paste OKC and the website might have to work on in total about 7 Minutes of time spent making the website buying the bank in the DNS settings is Squarespace a weekend or anything like that just need to make a simple one-page website and then get over the life"

I told him about content then we'll talk about timing and then we'll talk about practice and hopefully keep it short and sweet actually seen that section 2 mostly test human biology would not much in the way of clowns and ecology Enola there is some stuff that you have to know about the carbon and nitrogen cycles and every now and then they might ask you to compare and then the plant cell and an animal cell but for the most part it is human biology that testing the content of section 2 biology is very well described in the section to it seems knowledge guide which I link in the description below and which you should definitely be using in your body preparation to make sure you plug all the holes in your as always if you like you can always find a run preparation that's on pmat ninja but to be honest the section to assume knowledge guide disappoint good and wielded biology a-level so you probably won't need RX for next question which is really really really talked to the timing however you should be aiming to do the biology questions in Fall last time that this is because the biology questions are generally factual repo based and don't involve any complicated calculations like the physics chemistry can you recall the incident is produced in the pancreas or can you remember which way blood flows around the chambers of the heart that little thing to use on the other more complicated but having said that don't be rushing to the biology questions they are the easiest questions in the paper and we should be getting full of those easy Mo cool that's timing let's talk about practice as always you can practice loads and loads of Parts biology questions on B messenger completely free of charge I don't like the idea of that you can always print out the past papers since 2003 and its work for those I wouldn't spend an inordinate amount of time practicing biology section 2 science is enough and would be better spent getting better at physics and chemistry months letting mobile is the fact that you should be spending less time on biology than on physics and chemistry best thank you very much for watching please comment if you have any questions please give it a thumbs up if you like the video and please subscribe to the channel if you feel like it have a great day and I will see you in the next few minutes of video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him on his final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is part 3 of a three-part revision tips Q&A Series where you go setting questions on me and to my medical student friends we on some of them a couple weeks ago back when the channel is on like 10,000 subscribers is going to be about how to prepare for University exams but I think the tips will also apply to people with very content happy a level syllabuses or GC Services what's the first one but I can recall on the second one about spaced repetition this video this Q&A sort of assumes you'll renew those very basic things because I could recall the specifications are by far the single biggest thing you can do to really make your vision much much more efficient if you don't know about those yet video watch this first because without those tips it's like anything else is going to dictate the structure of the video with me giving you four tips for how to do well in University style exams but as I said I hope the tips of those apply to a level in GCC to dances well the second pause video will be answering seven different questions you guys sent in a couple weeks ago everything to be Lincoln x x in the description below please don't watch this whole video please look in the description and like go to the appropriate time stamp based on the stuff that you think will add the most value to your life like Advocate you watching all of it first day I want to talk about the importance of scoping your subject and we talked about this in a previous Q&A video but I want to hear from people over the last couple of weeks August 7th elections to get through in the next 3 weeks I don't know how I'm going to do it the way you do it is by scraping your subject and make sure you have like this broad conceptual outline of all of the different subjects that make up your subject all the different topics that make it up and within each tropical importance and that's the very first thing you should be doing before you get started with any kind of reason to feel that I think I missed a lot of University students make and possibly is a plus-11 Jesus you as well is that you think Alexa's to get to restart going through them chronologically and very efficient way of inviting information into your brain instead what you wanna be doing is cooking your subject you want to have a look through just like a quick skim through all seven of those lectures and see if he can break it up into manageable topics if universities organize your clothes will already be still up in Tavares 70 lectures you have to get through it'll be maybe $15 a month First Dates pick up everything you need to do in to dip into manageable topic you can see more about my revision spreadsheet spaced repetition system that's based around kind of doing one or two or three topics each day and then doing active recall of this topic this list of topics again I don't think that oh crap I'll go 17 exit to go through instead you want to be thinking of what are the main Salient points of these topics what's like the broad skeleton of each of these effects like how would you summarize in one line okay smoothies healthy summer single page with the bitmojis have another mistake that people make that I so need to make a lot of my friends used to make weave we would we would focus on single lecture series or single lectures and try and learn the detail like instead we just want to be getting a broad idea of what was in that lecture what the subheadings were right in this lecture about diabetes we talked about management investigation done we were talking about specifically and how the pancreas works the next diabetic drugs in the mechanisms of action saying what was in that lecture and if we do this weekend a very good understanding of what goes into a course and then looking at past papers and looking at kind of essay questions about something we can start targeting the areas that we need to prioritize so going back to this again if you are in the position where you have somebody that has to get through in a small amount of time 5-minute spell lecture and nnnn stick to that only 5 minutes for each lecture a 10.5 minutes you want to skim through it and it's kind of jolt down the most Salient points right down the topics on the subheadings that you want within that if you spent five minutes doing that for old 70 350 minutes. Convert used to be done with a single day a single morning or afternoon now you suddenly have a broad understanding of what's in the entire entire subject through its that would be my first step for University students or if your high-level DCC and you have recounted heavy stuff Skokie subject II tip is if you have acid in your exam and I know I must university courses the exams tend to be essay based basal revision around planning essays back this to getting back to the sexual thing that say we have 10 lectures to get through what we don't want to do it stinks right I'm going to go through extra one and then I'm going to go through that you're too and then I'm going to go through lunch at 3 instead take those 10 lectures single topic for example and either using past papers productivity previous I think I feel hopefully you had supervisions or tutorials or whatever they're giving us a toast but if not NSA plan and base your answer around these 10 lectures and refrigerating that way in the end if one of them comes up in the exam is pretty high Teddy after you've already planned still have covered all of the content of the of all the lectures but you have done it in a way that kind of answer specific questions therefore you know you're targeting the material that most important other than kind of sometimes the fluff Alexis Uninvited reading the first you'll be talkin to contact the focus passion and secondly there is a bit of evidence that shows that when you have this sort of structure where you're structuring your revision based around activity trying to answer question actively trying to go for this goal of what is the answer to the question how would I write this that Richard that improves your your understanding and your retention of of the topic of different benefits to using a safe and that's the way forward during this time I do know your exam and then prepare for the exam as bad as it sounds if you only have a few weeks until your exam and you're concerned about your exam the exam is what you need to be preparing for us universities for whatever learning and for wider experience and this that and the other but really the point we have to focus on the exam structural revision around those if you don't like math or engineering people doing the subject of how do you use your active Rico method for math and physics active recall writing questions for myself if I would be focusing on stuff that is what and obviously you don't want to be driving the crew from first principles in the exam see one of them right there and you can do that using Auntie using any kind of flash card using a spreadsheet spaced repetition system I got more videos that will do things here in end in the description below the most important points for getting through University life in an efficient and stress-free way and that is to really make use of people in the year above and the years above that have been through the course before you find that students in the Years above all more than happy to give you like we are flattered that I'm 65 yesterday mean absolutely love it when people come to me how do you how do you maximize your mocking this exam you don't really want to talk to the attendance because all the attention they like scary maybe people have this when it comes to University staff when it comes to you no decency edible stuff please don't have this atoll specially when you get University this whole year group divide thing completely disappears I love being friends with people in the air blow is it just like it is flattering it's nice I like the fact that I can give advice that I can share my notes onto the vast majority of students that I've met are in the same position so if you are struggling with your subject just find somebody to hear about their life to find you can see them around campus or around you play Joe Randazzo Christian union or whatever bushing hold you like to spend time at this point in the year above Austin for the notes awesome if they got any advice you wanna obviously make friends with you would agree with your on your grave but do make an effort to be friends with people you may be in for 15 and 56 are so important that you know you can get there that perspective their experience you can't even take advantage of they've been three different type of the same exam that you're preparing for you can use the notes increase the effect of friends it makes everything a lot more nice even ask them for advice or advise if they've got friends younger than you and it just creates is nice kind of cookies a community of everyone helping each other out you're in the Years above you kind of need to be the one to make the effort and the reason for this is that speaking from the perspective is over 6 there in like I enjoy having friends in and used a different perspective I would feel kind of kind of creepy if I were the one most of the effort to begin with because they just they say just seems a bit before hear of this is like Bauer you have as an older student to be friends with younger student at least at least initially a friend of mine gave me this really good advice he said make sure you make fun of the people in the Xbox so actively made it to get to know the people in my college in the Years above the people in the Pakistan Society Islamic society and things I'm still friends with to this day if I could have waited for them to extend a hand of friendship they might have felt a bit worried about it because it's a bit it's a bit weird on your ass out here in front of Fresh Horses Master pointers for people going into the clinical years of medical school that when you get into placement the hospital and stuff you want to be the one to make friends for the junior doctors the fy1 cfy choose the people who are in who have been in that position like that you are in five years ago they want to be friends with you like I'm going to be next year and I would like to know if there are medical students in my Hospital in my world I would love to be friends with them but I would feel weird if I were the one extending the hand of friendship it would be a lot less weird if they were the ones who you know we're going to being poly with me because then I know where I stand I don't want to have this thing in my hand therap 40 American I'm a junior doctor and on the female which is even worse what if it's in his creepy if I'm like oh hey do you want to grab a coffee and we can go over some stuff if that for him it would be like hey can you give us a division yes I would love to share them with them literally everyone in this position please please please make friends of the people in the years of you friendship and in terms of preparing for exams talk to you a hundredfold because people will share with you the notes that results is over the material that part 2 PDF of textbooks whatever y'all stand for and they'll give you advice on how to do well on this exam so if you weren't doing this already please please please make friends with and then subsequently take advantage of people in the US okay so that was my four tips on how to do well in University exam whenever one scoop you subject phone number to base everything around is a plaintiff is an essay subject 3 if you doing math engineering physics wallpapers of the way for What from what I understand Lakefront to the people in a people in the US but he wanted for help often forgotten it is the way forward it is the way to make you whole universe experience a lot more fun and a lot less stressful for the 10,000 subscribers questions aimed at University students by election stuff and then those two questions like random questions so that me and my friends pulled and Catherine were going to be on Spring those in the description to see what specific questions for answering it what timestamp so you can kind of Target those appropriately you can just like in a month the subject and then after that then decide which bits can check out you know the most essential bit two bits division timetables timetables you do how do you make a good one realistic for you to do it I think I love you go, come and stuck as well because they're like oh I know today I'm going to read three chapters and you can you can do is one chapter of things I'm going to be doing for the day like if I'm visiting a friend if I've got an appointment Apple the end so that I can budget them out to work I need to do and the last name without saying so so give yourself for me to play around that block and your Friday's weather forecast amazing than the allows for that still next question how do you cope with a massive worker that you got in uni I've heard that was expected to cover every single topic before exams because there's just so much to cover which what the point does detail is that subpoena for those kids coming up in the air and spend your time focusing on the stuff you know the bread-and-butter that's going to get you missed in the Box automatic sound like my brother he deleted Matthew Kangas we known about this because this is all next week about MedEx love to talk about how Bloody hard the degree is and how much work for there is at everyone from the age of like 12 who'd even thinking of doing medicine gets fed this Narrative of oh my God so so so hot it's so much work it's such a dump jumping out of the University medicine is conceptually hard it does just a load of content to cover and you can do it I'll give you some like math or engineering I actually have to think on their technique to memorize stuff like I spaced repetition active recall if you're applying for medicine or if you've gone over medicine for medical student let's try to break this Narrative of oh my God medicine is so hard I'm so hard done by because something I don't know another subject that has less even though it might be more is because with medicine because there are a lot of detailed facts you can learn it can kind of go on forever and you have to be good at setting at which you decide on this much I know that you know hundred 200 causes of atrial fibrillation and the basics first and then I can build up from that and you know it off to be a competent safe. Seth and you don't need to carry on studying forever and ever until you know futile dubstep how do you get through recommended ended reading quickly so that the set of four subjects are required to reading that give you reading list relia party food ideas to do politics psychology and sociology because in a book review give you a summary of what the book said and then also gives you some critique of the book so it was like she soup useful and getting through oval idea of text that I just couldn't physically get food because my reading speed was so poolside not read in those kind of volume since school go with mine weed legal in mind I found this revision around an essay titled like do animals have a theory of mind then like older 20 different papers that run in five textbooks I'm fully just intently focused on answering that question throw away if it does and it sounds nice I'll memorize a paragraph put into my flesh Kodak and regurgitate to in the exam with a bit of you know Edition so it doesn't like Festival review papers in the best night then from that you can link their primary research and secondary to just to reiterate Wiley said read of a gold mine so for example for me usually Arie reverse-engineer it I think this 2.10 making my satanic Google and I look for research election that's that supported and I find the paragraph that supported the paper and then Uncle Jesse's about like you I wish I would have said gender differences in intelligence and IQ have been being studied for four centuries quotes of someone from 1902 paper that present 1775 paper but I read the fact that he said that in some other paper and I'm going to read. or you can even just Google history of IQ research find the right paper and then just called him straight away. take him to make good recent material threat of the year do you look at the gums papers first this is asking for my boy. before are you able to explain this to somebody else and then after that acted Rico is very important but that that comes when you're trying to revise it so good all I make is questions so I make questions Basin electronauts and then you kind of have to make notes because you have no other choice find some guy on some Forum who's like remnants out for you anything to avoid having to make note to self but sometimes it's necessary College of the Atlantic Society of Singapore question what is your opinion on pre-made notes we love him people I don't know people actually Lamarcus who who love making notes for their intervention like they learn by making a note to self then making your nose can be a really important part of that process with after they made a Note II they can pitch in the mine where that bit of information was that helps them that's you then I think of you add corn not happy with the results if a person has spent 8 hours making those results and please continue continue but if you thinking nothing's going in and maybe it's time to maybe don't feel like you know just because we say making notes and sometimes by the time it's a one-size-fits-all solution active recall however is a one-size-fits-all solution approaching the second pills my question what is your favorite station route to work with G27 gel blue 207 pilot blue pens. The secret guys. How you doing today I mean about 43p incredible invite down stuff you know about topical write down answers to your flashcards whatever then I look at the original flash, I didn't remember this right next to it and then come when I come back to another time you know I can do the same thing see what time affiliate links for the biggest token interesting questions I can experience pain before and then when it's time to break the fast I have my day August 8th my my my like what what what it's just kind of asleep after Fajr wake up pretty late controversial people say that kind of defeats the purpose of Ramadan but I think that's what I did last year against him there before that when it was kind of overlapping good luck okay and savior savior that you do some work for you.

            "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nrAKLZgMM",
            "text": " play Prince welcome back to the channel I can you hit my name is Eliana. The base in the UK and this is a review of the brand new Apple 2020 M1 MacBook Air because as you guys know I'm a huge fan of upfront conclusions I'm just going to tell you up front I think this laptop is basic be as close to perfect as an entry-level applicant of the MacBook Air was nearly there it was nearly the perfect laptop and even then I said that if anyone is in the market for a laptop and you can afford a Macbook and MacBook you should just go for the MacBook Air that one issues with thermal performance and fan noise and overheating and stuff this one has none of those issues this is absolutely sick and in the rest of the review I'm going to try and justify why things not absolutely sick and why it's pretty much a no-brainer if you bucket for a reasonably priced MacBook look no further than this this is one so if you go $1,000 that you want to spend on a laptop and you can tell the video off and do some time but if you're interested in the full review that's what I'm talking about now let's talk by talking about the processor and this is the big news in the past Apple has been using intel-based processes but now as of like this week they have switch some of the laptops the MacBook Air to MacBook Pro and the Mac mini reviews on those coming out of those to the Rhone internally designed Apple silicone M1 chip. This means that the processor is similar to what you got in iPhones and iPads I eat it's really really really fast and it's very like ridiculously well optimized for Apple Hardware because now Apple makes software to make the hardware and they make the processor as well and that means that you just get ridiculous levels of performance and you get this I don't think so as soon as you open the device you expect with an iPhone let's talk about numbers now so it when it comes to the apple design processes like on the iPhone the iPad on the Apple watch they don't really talk about processor speed and cook speed and all that stuff that you hear the Android phone manufacturers talking about because I pulled just kind of a Karen beat it like to show they don't care and see it it really doesn't matter what the numbers are because everything is so tightly integrated in the past with the intel-based chips they they were talking about processes they was saying hey this is Price is Right now they're just calling it the M1 processor because no one really cares about the numbers but if you do care about the numbers and I have now started caring about the numbers in front of your Betta Tegrity or you can look to benchmarks like the geekbench score and that gives you an idea of how like the numbers how well the processor is performing so that take a look at those schools look like so if you look at single-core performance you see the MacBook Pro to Mac Mini and the MacBook Air the M1 versions are absolutely miles ahead of everything else even the mid-20s you're the one that just came out Intel Core I9 3.6 gigahertz 10 core processor on the iMac is like 25% slower than these new M1 chips that are on this $900 MacBook Air if your student a person using this laptop even if even if your program using this laptop you are very very very unlikely to have any issues with the formans just because of how fast these processes are super fancy Mac Pro's would cost like $50,000 but if we look down this is the Mac Mini with the M1 and these are the M1 processor so they're in the 7202 7400 range and all these other ones I like very expensive Optical performance than the 16 in MacBook Pro it came with the Intel I9 processors with with a coolest only came out last year that's a huge piece of laptop this is a MacBook Pro 15 inch MacBook Pro from 2018 has been my driver the driving this whole setup would like Thunderbolt ports in 2018 and I haven't needed to upgrade this because it was fast enough I did not need to upgrade to the 2018 or the 2019 or the 2020 version and this is so much faster than this in terms of just the role he turned scores and so it when it comes to buying this is ridiculously cheap now like for the amount of performance you get your not going to have a problem with prices to feed a fan and with the previous MacBook Air the which I pulled my favorite muffin time shoes with hook with overheating if you did a few different things it would get really hot and it was tough to make a huge noise because that had fun and if you like sitting on a sofa with it in your life which I do a lost then my jeans were getting really really hot and I will always think like I wet myself because this just getting so hot on my Jean this I've had like literally literally zero issue so that it does not have a fan it doesn't even need to find because the processor is so efficient and so that I use computer for is Chrome notion Spotify very tasteful use Final Cut because it everyday edit my videos anymore but like it's fairly basic Computing needs even though I'm not much but even with like 20 tabs in Chrome open slakah Zoom cool this was not play it was not even coming close to getting hot it was that efficient the only context in which this might be a problem is if you are using very very intense of apps in which case you might want to go to the MacBook Pro instead because that has a fan and it will have less thermal throttling at those higher levels of performance but for most people including me you're really need those how that was before months and so the MacBook Air is absolutely perfect final thing about the processor compatibility because these processes the way that programmers apparently design there software is that it is optimized for specific architecture the processor so what are the apps previously do running on MacBooks with optimized for Intel x86 base processes you know what that means a very well optimized for the new M1 chip so everything that will make like Safari in Final Cuts and the photos app in messages and most of the stuff you would need to use is perfectly optimized for this but if you baby sweet for example on not yet perfectly optimized very soon and apparently a version of Photoshop that but in the meantime you are running slightly suboptimal before any of this personally I haven't myself but based on what other reviewers are saying even the unoptimized versions of Premiere Pro and Photoshop still work Define and so you should worry about after possibility is if you for your personal workflow using like a really really neshap which might not yet be updated and said before you go buy one of these or one of the new M1 chips but I'd recommend is that you do Google or you search on YouTube and you see whether your Apple has been updated and a compatible with the ship for 99% of people watching this video you were not going to have any issues at all the other things that are important about the surface design its grapes and very lifestyle put the way over here once I've had a chance to stick this on my scales in fact you know what to do that right now 1261.2 kg this is this is very nice in fact this iPad Pro with keyboard is lighter and cheaper than this setup would cost of roll like 1,300 1,400 lb and is actually heavier pretty cool so more about that later and it's the same kind of wedge design that you have grown to love somebody updated the Divine a****** everything is basically the same from the previous versions of MacBook Air I wish the bessels around the screen were a little bit less thick you can kind of notice them and in some more than Windows laptop didn't have any business at all but the next time fingers let's see what legit I have beaten my record on this privacy my record was 156 what's minute this is 159 West minute I want to get this on camera because that's 159 what's minutes on this new 20 funny and 1 MacBook Air overall this keyboard is great I really like the fact that it has an Escape key and this is like one annoying thing about the MacBook Pro Line that has that crappy touch bar over here with a touch ID button brightness do funky stuff like play Fast Forward rewind on Spotify walking speed let's not talk about the importance of the keyboard battery life is another area in which this machine is made absolute games over the previous models Apple advertising that you can get like 15 to 17 hours of video playback / web browsing on this and on the MacBook Pro which has a slightly bigger battery and this is absolutely insane this is like at least a 50% increase over previous generations and I've done a lot of browsing the web for these battery test and basically everyone is saying that guys when you get to the battery behind this thing like the battery size itself has not changed compared to the previous models but because this new apple-designed M1 chip is very very very efficient at using the battery it just does really well in terms of battery life. If this was the only thing that was improved with this generation of MacBook Air or MacBook Pro what about fainted because I think an extra 50% to 100% battery life is worth it because I feel like I have to carry around a charger everywhere I go and because of the battery life improvements in this thing it means that I actually do need to carry a child around and this is a significant quality of life and my shoulders and my back so basically zero complaints on the battery life runs but actually the battery is one of the reasons why I'm probably going to go for the MacBook Pro rather than this MacBook Air because for an extra $300 I'm getting an extra 2 hours of battery life which is useful day today but if you a person who buys one of these and has been for a very very long time like my housemate has been using my MacBook after 5 years my old house may have been using leftover eight years if you use it for a very extended amount of time overtime the battery gets lesson that's good and so if you're buying a laptop to for the long run then you might want to buy the MacBook Pro instead which has the $300 a slightly better battery and therefore you going to have slightly better battery life overall throughout the life of the machine I really sound like display 2560 X 1600 pixels of brightness what does that mean well Foreman is brightness to maximum point it's reasonable but not super bright the MacBook Pro has 500 at the brightness at 25% formal dresses pretty good for most people in most circumstances but for example if you're on the beach or you're going to walk outside in the garden and there's a lot of sunlight you might struggle to say something on a 400 brightness screen if that's something that you really care about you I do actually care about which is why I'm probably going to go to the MacBook Pro Retina MacBook Air but it is what it is let's talk about now so we have to USB 3/4 and you have a headphone jack on the other side this is a little bit they have more than two ports because you know one two three four I'm using also put in my 2018 15 inch MacBook Pro to connect to my big display on the EVP Prince battery life you probably aren't going to need to Lug around a charger with you if you're taking this out for the day and therefore you probably would need to have HR department plugged in at all times like I have to do with old laptops that USB C Thunderbolt still have old USB a devices most of my stuff these days is how USBC anyway so this is absolutely fine to Ports is reasonable but if you need more you probably don't want to go to one of these let's talk about the microphone on the camera all-in-one now this has pretty standard microphone features on it and so I'm going to film a video photo booth and you'll see this is what the microphone on the MacBook sounds like and this is what my profit of $500 audio setup thing sounds like and not going back to the MacBook Pro did the HD camera this time is now they've used the neural engine fancy bits of the processor which mean that the processor is doing image improvements on the fly so I look a little bit better and this is similar to what the iPhone and the iPad do with their cameras but like there's a lot of computational software stuff happening behind the scenes to make you look good and now this is what is on this camera as well so if you're on FaceTime calls with your boyfriend's family or Zoom pools with your friends but it's not because of the camera it's because of the neural engine Ethan the underlined get that improves the image quality of this song base model cost 999999 dollars and you get a 100% discount if you're a student I actually think the base model is completely fine for most people you could just buy this and you don't need to get any upgrades because a 256gb SSD reasonable for most students and for a lot of people and 8GB Ram is reasonable for the vast majority of people if you're a pro and you need to run lots of performance of applications that use multi-core stuff and stuff maybe one upgrade to the 16GB version but if you're a pro you probably don't want to get this one unless you'd like me to use operator for you if you're a pro you probably want to wait until next year for the proper 649 16 inch MacBook Pro unless you probably want to wait for that and so if you're a student is prep for cash then the basic model the cheapest model of the MacBook Air will be completely fine for you if I was dating one person for me I care a lot about the Foreman's and I don't really care about spending money and so I should go for the upgrade and I actually probably go to the 2 terabyte SSD as well it's because I do a little work with videos and so for me even like 1 terabyte SSD 1 terabyte SSD what used to be a lot more expensive back in the day and I often find myself running out of space so I would like really huge ass 4K video files like the fault of this video going to be like a hundred fifty bucks in total long story short the configuration I would recommend is just the cheapest one to be made for upgrading the ram usually upgrade ram this is what should you say when people say that you actually do need to upgrade the some people say that you should I think if your student ID strapped for cash you probably won't notice the difference between 8 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes but if you can if you want to spend $1,000 are on laptop or thereabouts then you recalling anything better than this but as I'm going to be talking about in my next video if you can if you intend to keep this for very long and you want to Shell out an extra $3,400 then I would consider upgrading to the MacBook Pro instead and that is what we could be talking about in this video over here in the next few days if it's not already thanks so much watching already have that was useful to him to subscribe button if you don't already and I'll see you next time"

            "text": " my friends welcome back to the channel and to the special edition study with me video the day starts at 9:30 a.m. when I wake up in my pot in a capsule hotel in Narita International Airport in Japan or change out of my smoke have a shower brush my teeth in a box ready to fly back to the UK with British Airways business class very exciting Leah managed to snag the tickets for me and my mom using my a miles accumulated over to hear. Along with the buy one get one free companion voucher that you get if you're a big spender on America #Flex we check in and head over to the fancy business class Sakura lounge or I spend a large amount of time feeling stuff and not much time eating the free food the waitress in the lounge very kind he prepares us a special order of Halal beef noodles which are trying to move down to maximize the value from this ridiculous experience at 12 noon we board the plane I get a cheeky coffee and spend a large amount of time playing around with the fanciest features of the seat and lamenting how many mls does upgrade cost just after taking off after a few seconds For an upcoming potential V review of British Airways business class and my mom and I have a bit of banter with the air hostess who's very excited that would both doctors at 1:30 p.m. I bust out my iPad and decide to start to work but then ran out of battery and so I plug it into the Plex okay that's my seat for the charger I bust out my Nintendo switch and play some Witcher 3 I wasted distressing a large amount of time of that until food arrives at 20 pause to the food is pretty tasty and it's a surprisingly nice experience to eat from glass plates and metal Cutlery on an airplane it's now 3 p at this point I reset my watch to UK time so now it's actually 6 a.m. with this realization I decide to have enough for a couple of hours and then begin my day of productive studying on the airplane I managed to get a bit of sleep until half past 8 when I wake up and head to the bathroom to freshen up fancy toiletry that they gave us a free after. I'll grab some snacks and head back to my seat to start work at 8:55 I'll start going through the physiology textbook levics introduction to cardiovascular physiology I'm using notability on my iPad Pro to read the PDF add the note taking app in split screen I started watching at a quick outline of all the chapters in the book this is scooping the subject in action and it only takes a small amount of time to do but it pays dividends in the long run because it means that while reading through the book will have an intuitive understanding of current chapter fit into the bigger picture of the typing out the table of contents I look through the lecture notes and figure out which chapters in The Textbook correspond to which lectures this information will be really useful later on because I'm going through the lectures I'll be able to easily find more information and reference in the textbook from 9:20 a.m. I decide to make a start on chapter 3 of The Textbook often if I'm revising a subject rather than letting it for the first time I'd like to not start at chapter 1 the problem with starting with chapter 1 is that it's often really introductory content and feels like a bit of a time anyway I'll make us do in chapter 3 which is all about the excitation and contraction of cardiac muscle cells one of the things I love about this text back is that they have really good learning objectives at the start of each chapter so in the first instance I spend some time testing myself all the chapters learning effect and crucially I'm doing this before I read the chapter there's a ton of evidence that shows the testing ourselves with questions before we even study the topic leads to Greater understanding and retention this applies even more certain math and Engineering problems the results of studies where students given us a problems to solve before they get told that subject end up performing better than students who would just put it straight away and then tested off do it anyway while I'm texting myself on this learning objectives I decide to actually type out references as I'm going along it's very tempting to do this sort of stuff in our heads unfolding myself to write stuff out if forces me to actually think through if I just looked at the questions and try to answer them in my head I probably would have become super lazy and just thought of I don't know this rather than actively trying to dredge up anything I can for my memory and as I said a hundred previous videos it's this very active dredging up old information that strengthens our memory and the more effortful it feels to record stuff the more cognitive labor having to put into it the most strongly that stuff is going to stick in our brains at 9:35 I spend half an hour working my way through he just two pages in the book as I'm going through it I'm making a note of stuff that's either really knew already important it's worth mentioning that 30 minutes for two pages is pretty slow going but when we're trying to understand difficult concept and can take ages to get our heads around them at least to me and there's no substitute for spending that time grappling with the subject of trying to understand it when people just sit and by that I mean we'd be able to comfortably explain it to a five-year-old then we entity memorization stage and that's where we can save a lot of time with things like active recall spaced repetition into leaving probation and oldies other effective studying techniques. Made loads of other videos about the Old Link in the video description at this point off to just over an hour of studying I decide to take a quick break I bust out my fencing noise cancelling headphones and spend some time listening to an audiobook on Audible number three of The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan the right side buddy incredible fantasy neuritis Michael Kramer and Kate reading these days I listen to Audible for one or two hours a day first lie on my 1 hour drive to and from the hospital where I work and also at the gym with my hold rifle protiviti fantasy audiobooks is my main source of unwinding and it's a bonus that I can do it while I'm driving or at the gym #multitasking if you don't listen to audiobook then you can sign up for a free trial of audible at audible.com. Or if you're in the US you can text Ally ability 500 if you need to order books I'd recommend starting with Stardust by Neil Gaiman he's a fantastic writer and star. It's a lovely story with a nice wholesome dose of romance each month I've been plugging audible long before they start sponsoring my videos just because I love it so much if you want to sign up and please visit audible.com to 500 500 the free trial of the month and you get one audiobook and two audible Originals completely free Serbia sign up and thank you for sponsoring this video from 10:30 I continue going through the textbook noting down the stadium points all the stuff that's new to me there are a couple of points I want to make have fell asleep one taking notes I like to keep in mind that any sort of information is a balance between and compression a textbook has a lot of context but not a lot of compression which is why reading a textbook takes ages shorthand notes have a lot of compression but that comes at the expense of contact necessarily so here when I'm writing calcium initiate shortening Vallarta complex that is a complex process massively compressed into the shorthand this sentence is going to make absolutely no sense to someone who doesn't understand the topic but when I read it I know that it's poking about the troponin-tropomyosin complex that prevents muscle cells from Contracting arrest did the program ice in blocking the actin binding site to myosin and this is all connected to the protein component and troponin response to calcium ions that bind to one of its subunits decease of unit and then that causes a conformational change in the others now the actin binding site on my skin is exposed to that reactant combine to it flooding across bridge and then we put the whole complicated procedure crossword cycling involving ATP in muscle contraction so that would be the contact that I've got for my lecture notes a textbook YouTube videos and I've compressed into the show calcium initiate shortening by the TTM complex one mistake I used to make when taking notes in my first year of medical school is that I used to have too much context in my notes I either used to be way too long and almost a copy of the lecture notes this is something that lots of my friends used well when we first started medical school we kept the bad habits that we develop during rgcc and a-levels you could probably write detailed notes and everything memorized it all and get 100% of the exam for the Easley but at University that strategy was doomed to failure there was just too much stuff one way to deal with that stuff then was to get really good at compressing entrusting that would be able to refer to the lecture notes or the textbook or even to Google and Wikipedia we needed the context in the future and in fact almost none of my friend continued to strategy of making tell notes and if we made any notes at old baby Mega compressed the second Point here is one that I saying every video not if we look at the evidence from scientific studies summarizing content which is exactly what I'm doing here but taking notes directly from the textbook is it generally ineffective way to retaining banana brains the key to retaining information is by testing ourselves on it I ate at the Regal and doing that repeatedly over a long. Of time I spaced repetition what I'm doing in this study session is there for suboptimal but there are three reasons why I'm okay with it for now first late testing this stuff actually helps me understand the content in the first place because I can do things like how to grow eyes and Humira size it and all that stuff so I can lay I've already tested myself once with the learning objectives at the start of the chapter and I'm going to test myself on them again whenever I come across this chapter again and said Leon transfer Deez Nuts in Bear over to the app notion at some point and when I do I'll write questions for myself above each point for example here I've summarized the difference intracellular calcium concentrations in skeletal and cardiac muscle and how that relates to the determinants of contractility in when do I get round to copying and pasting the spit into notion I'll write out a question like what determines contractile force in cardiac vs. skeletal muscle and then using the toggle feature of notion or hide the answer so that'll be easy to test myself next time of doing this topic would have done it the first time around but sadly notion doesn't work very well offline and there's no Wi-Fi on the airplane know even in business class #first world problems MRI I continue along this vein for around half an hour while listening to my Spotify study with me tightest which you can check out with Lincoln the video describe you like by 11 a.m. though I notice my mind starting to wonder and so I decided to stop work for now from 11 to 12 I dumped lots of footage from my camera SD card onto my external hard drive and I go through the photos from my recent trip to Japan and Spain to figure out what's going on Facebook and what's guy PS please follow me on Instagram if you already at noon considered doing some more work for that I think screw it and spend the next two glorious I was playing The Witcher 3 on the Nintendo switch while playing or do you get a few withdrawal symptoms from wasting so much time with Papa my chest and tingling in my fingers to tell myself that it's okay to relax at least once in awhile lunch then arrives and it's a pretty tasty three-course meal with tuna and noodles and then at 10 past 2 I can't bear wasting anymore time on video games and so I get back to studying I ask for another post-lunch coffee to keep myself awake and then I spend the next 40 minutes continuing to work through this book chapter at the end of every paragraph I am of course asking myself the tucasa questions of first late does this make sense and secondly could I explain this to a five-year-old if y'all either those questions as note then I figure out where the hole in my knowledge is and try to plug it as what normally I'd be using all the resources like Google and Wikipedia to help plug holes in my understanding given my lack of access to the internet I make do with a textbook and Ash such a good textbook. I don't really need external resources around 3 p.m. we get the announcement of the plane's going to land in 40 minutes I decide to stop working then and get my brother to be cameraman while I showcased some of the fancy features of the seat of my upcoming official review of British Airways business class which now that I think about it I'm going to blow the way because it seems the only thing you didn't seem to care about is videos about tech and about studying if you'd be interested in seeing a proper video review our talk about how much this cost and whether it's worth it please do let me know in the comments the plane lands before dim and so ends the business class experience and is somewhat Noble semi study themed video I pretty like the idea of doing study with me videos in unusual location so if you like this one then please do leave a comment down below and I'll try and study and mold weird exam places for your amusement thank you so much for watching a little bit with my neck because it's really quite an old house supposed to channel have a lovely day and I will see you in the next video goodbye"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew hit my name is Ali I'm a Genie doctor working in Cambridge on top tips for entrepreneurs the stuff that I picked up over the last six years of running a business school 6 met while I was a medical student at Cambridge University. Businesses made about hundred thousand pounds of top-line Revenue over the last six years and he converted to dollars it becomes a million-dollar anyway in the story of how my friends and I started this company and how it grew up tips for students or anyone else interested in starting run becoming an entrepreneur making money online all of that good job so I'll keep this part of the video breathe radio Story Time video basically in a second year of medical school me and some friends decided it would be cool to run a course for one of the medical school admissions test called the peanuts we've been on causes of Salvage run by big corporations we thought they were big crap and they were charging lots of money so we thought we could do a better job and charge less money and also we could give out free places to students from low-income background and when we started we thought it would just be like a small-scale thing we thought we just kind of run a course I do but then I had the idea that because I've been making websites and stuff since like the age of 12 why don't we just make a website for this and try and Market nationally and then we'll get people up another country to join our closest rather than just people in a local Town answer from that we made the quote we made the website we run 5 so that causes that you're too about a hundred twenty students and then we were like oh my God this is amazing so the following year we expanded into the uke chords and then we made it cool to Medical School interviews then those did really really well then we decided to make a question bank for the beam and for the UK very well and so every year this company kept on growing we kept getting more students we tame expander locations we talked was in Singapore chocolates in Hong Kong we talked was in the Netherlands and it turned into this like surprising you big thing but now let's talk about the volume top tips for entrepreneurs don't wait for permission and often when was doing something wrong with thinking of starting a business or YouTube channel or blog or anything like that we will have in our minds this issue of I'm just not qualified like waiting for someone to give us permission waiting for like an official degree to save a qualified or certificate from someone to say that we're allowed to do this thing but like over the last 6-7 years of running the company I've realized that my friends there are so few Domaine than what you actually need to be qualified we can create some kind of product I always say you know if you're a doctor you need to be Boulevard before you can start treating patient but in most runs a business you can pretty much just start doing it whenever you want and if you're providing a good service and people are happy to pay you money for it and leaving good reviews that's older secondly I think it's really important when doing this whole business startup entrepreneur making money online thing to stand on the shoulders of the Giants that come before us entrepreneurship and business isn't really a new thing anymore it's a very well trodden part that people have been doing for decades centuries in the last few decades we've got loads and loads of books podcast website article interviews with people who have set up their own businesses and those people have done a really good job of sharing all the things they know so specific results of that you'll find helpful the 4-Hour Work Week absolutely incredible I'll just thinking about how does website called Indie hackers that had interviews with founders of successful internet businesses they've got about a hundred podcast episode so far each of those are amazing through incredibly inspiring and you can learn a lot from these people is a goggle Paul Graham he's a partner combinator that's like the ivy league of Starz accelerated America he's written a ton of essays on his website about how to get start-up ideas how to start your own startup Seth Godin has a podcast. Frost alert about entrepreneurship and business. It's kind of like going to be a doctor without understanding anatomy and physiology like it's probably should understand the basic literature and then you know you can go and do what you want but we should definitely before we're taking the plunge into entrepreneurship it's incredibly useful to at least know the basics of how to code for two main reasons to open your mind up to potential business idea if I stop the best way to come up with start-up a business ideas is not to sit down with your friends but it's identify problems that you have in your life day today that you might be able to solve by creating a business of creating product and if you know how to code the Realms of possibility like you know what can be done and so if I say your doctor any working in healthcare and you discover some inefficiency or you know you're a student and you discover something that everyone's doing that could be done better Justified that you know how to code means that you'll be just these possibilities a lot more than someone who doesn't then secondly knowing how to code is very helpful because then when you have an idea let's say you have any idea for Facebook or feel me and you have the audio running these courses you can then just turn it into a business by yourself without needing to I'm bringing someone else and who knows how to code soap for example to text Matt if I didn't know how to make a website all cost would have had 12 people at the local mosque in Southend-on-Sea him that would have been the end of it but just this disability would like to create a website is what allowed it to become a national and then international business just like knowing how to go to suicide help on the way to help solidify your understanding of these cool concept I love you going through that you can go through that programming with python course are you interested in learning how to code useful to kind of develop a taste for design and develop a taste for what looks pretty and how to make stuff look pretty and this ability to make stuff look pretty is an absolute superpower in the world that we live in today to take an example of six even though we were competing against the big names in the market with just because all website look pretty and look legit I've been doing web design for ages on you how to make a pretty looking website and at the time in like 2012-2013 it wasn't as easy for just anyone to make website with Squarespace or Wix or whatever I'm looking my life personally it's not just 6-month the business that's benefited from my design background it's pretty much everything of everything else I've ever done so for example within medicine I've given presentations at conferences and I won those you know I won prizes for those and a feedback has been when you get out of attended these like medical hackathons wait like programming competitions where you build something and Pitch it to judges unlock three of them that I attended we ended up winning first prize and I think a big part of that was because our PowerPoint presentation just looked prettier than everyone else's I even got invited to join the bull just like International plastic surgery charity that does reconstructive surgery missions abroad and that was because they had a website I offered my services I was like hey I can make it website look a bit prettier on their lecture gave me access to this network of amazing plastic surgeon said it wouldn't have had contact with both of this YouTube channel like another thumbnails have a similar design I think they look kind of pretty I think the production value of these videos quite reasonable doubt ability to add production value to everything that you do is an amazing superpowers that benefits everything you do in life and not just in business and so yeah if you want to teach yourself the basics of design I recommend installing a browser extension cord Moseley and what that does that replaces your new tab you know on Chrome or Safari with like web design inspiration or some interesting typography or graphic design examples you to be able to procrastinate browse web design inspiration and then as I discovered things I bookmarked them and then over time as you become exposed to good design you develop a taste for it and so when you're done making your own stuff making your own website or making your own posters or even Justino generating of flyer for some event that you run local Moscow Church what about then you just have the ability to make it look pretty so much but if you want to go far you should go together I think that's very important but also if you're a student it's just it's just so much more fun when you're building a business like doing stuff with your friend continue like Building A Fire and all that stuff is more enjoyable when you doing with friends people that you like you got people helping out with it and yeah you might have to sacrifice a little bit of equity Elian but you know at the start time hennything is ready just cuz we think it's going to make us happier why not make us all happy about getting friends involved from day one and that was a thing that I would text Matt and really glad I did early on about half of the medics in my college ended up hitting coaches for us we had a team of like 20-25 people all of me and the founding people were friends with that's made like for a really fun environment and over they were challenges and stuff along the way just working with friends make the whole experience running a business that much more enjoyable is that you can start of really really small and this is a really important because whenever we're coming up with ideas and businesses are all thinking of doing something it's far too easy to get into his mindset where we keep on adding features are always be amazing for iPod this all be cool to add that and then the feature list keeps on growing and eventually we just never end up getting anything out cuz we're too concerned about trying to add new feature trying to make the thing better and in the start of World as I do have an MVP a minimum viable product which is the smallest version of your product or your Apple whatever that you can feasibly get in front of people so you start already small you build this town can you get it out in front of people and then over time using you the feedback and stuff you let it to write on the design and you just add more features overtime and improve the product in small ways and it doesn't even apply just a business as it applies to starting any kind of creative endeavor first piece the Mona Lisa isn't going to get anywhere but you know you have your Sketchbook you do these little drawing equally for YouTube channels if I had someone like you know a Peter McKinnon video or develop video as my so I need to get this good before I release a video I would never end up releasing anything at all thing I told myself ready I'll be on with that my first fifty or a hundred videos or just going to be absolutely terrible anyway so I might as well just get over that and then I can hopefully work towards making good videos to do things that don't scale and I think this advice originated from a tropical pool who is I want to partner that why coming into the dimension Delia and unlink the essay in which she talks about this world gives those are pretty good examples but the idea is that you want to do things that don't scale you want to be putting an extra effort to make your customers happy to recruit new customers all that stuff example of the guys who founded Airbnb initially in the first 30 day. Where are you know it was so tough and go no one really knew what was going to happen they physically went door-to-door in New York to all the Airbnb listing and they offered to take professional photos for those listings for I just called you anymore because they're not millions of people using Airbnb but at the start it was that physical effort that was needed to be put in by the founders in order to make another snowball start to roll over that first few years they sent handwritten thank you card to each of that customers and it's it's it's hard to imagine a company doing that in this day and age but if you'll selling a startup and you can put in the extra physical effort of delighting your customers and recruiting additional custom initiate then you're well on your way to success and I'll write about all the story so when we start mad why did was for the first couple of years whenever we get a new ordering I would email them personally and say hey look you know Texas honey ham to a course this is a bit about who I am is a team we believe that expertise amongst us if you have any question at all about the medicine application process evaluative us about studying anything just reply to this email and we'll get back to you, while I didn't realize you guys were like personable of that General Vibe do you think the students and hopefully the elite rewards further down the line and plus you know Audie we continue to have this attitude of delighting a customers as a business is growing or expect failure because chances are you'll start up is going to fail tiniest time child has a very very very unlikely that you'll thing will go well and in fact I had five failed businesses that I try to start up while I was in secondary school or high school if your American flight failed businesses me and my friend James each year we come out with a new plan to make money I would fail every single toy and it was the sixth one that was his idea for the GMAT crash course and that was eventually the thing that blossom into into six Matt and that made a mess of different my life but I want to make is that each time you fail it's actually through those fly fate is beforehand if I'd given up off the first one I want to know how to code in PHP I want to know how to make websites I went have known what goes into accepting payments online stuff it was going through those failures that ultimately led to the success really have any startup capital and any sort of cost These Days festival in internet business for a few dollars you can get a website domain get web hosting and start accepting credit card payments online it immediately so in a weekend and by spending maybe 10 $20 you've got this whole setup build your online business based on the potential upside of interviews on that podcast of people like you and me who have set up website or app so whatever from their bedrooms for practically zero who are they making tens of thousands of dollars a month further down the line if you treat it as an opportunity don't be to pull tell if you'll think failed because it's already a failure it's you know you've learned stuff and then they'll set you up for success for the number line point of annoying is that we should always ask ourselves why we're already doing it so you know it's it's easy enough to get caught up in the 2015-2016 around the point where our Revenue start to stagnate decline a little bit and then we'll competitive came into the market and then I was kind of thinking all the time you know I have to put in all this work but I'm not really enjoying running this business anymore anything you want change my life because this book ready to change my life and there's a quote in it which is probably my favorite quote of all time. The quote that I remind myself up whenever I'm feeling down or whatever I'm going to focus on the numbers never forget why you're really doing what you're doing all you helping people are they happy are you happy all your profitable isn't that enough amazingphil say that you know the only reason we run businesses because we think it's going to make us happy and it'll help people so if we're happy running it and we're helping people have a profitable having fun helping people and I think that the really important thing to remind us else especially again it would even with things like YouTube any time I start to get to focus on the numbers like old that video and twenty thousand views I was hoping is it still fun I'm having a good time hopefully helping out people and that's all that's really needed and funny point of a 10 is just start if you're interested no Inferno shape if you've gone through this really long video so far on your at this point you probably don't really need any more information you don't need more before you start something even if you don't know how to code just like an idea and start working on it and then you can learn the stuff you need to know after you go long people liking it to you know the analogy of people don't get rich by reading about going to the gym and they get raped by here setting up an eating healthy over a very long period of time I think so yeah it's good to stand on the shoulders of giants it's good to listen to Tim Ferriss and read his book and listen to Indie hackers and what will the Y combinator stuff but don't think that that's a substitute for actually doing your own thing because when you start that is when you really start to learn and then you can apply with the lessons you learn from the stuff that useful links in the video description to podcast interviews articles books at set for the last person you found helpful but the point I want to make ultimately is that you just don't like if you're thinking of starting a business this point in the video just go for it I promise you it will be an incredible experience and it will change your life so that's what I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need hit my name is Aaliyah I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is another installment in the monthly favorite series where I talk about stuff that I enjoyed that month and this video we're going to be talking about a book a blog post a podcast and a board game and it's going to be time Johnson the video description on the Nippon comment to feel free to skip around the video if you feel like it but yeah let's get started so the first thing I want to talk about is a book cool too bad blood by trap CO2 Jordan carry rude and this is absolutely amazing it's tagline secrets and lies in a Silicon Valley startup and it tells the story of the startup theranos you pronounce it which was a Starship that was able to revolutionize blood testing and they claimed they could make these boxes that would fit in your house and that you given a small amount of sample from your finger and it would be able to run under the blood test on those and over the course of about 10 years of the company ended up defrauding investors out of billions of dollars because the technology just didn't quite work and they were alive pretty much on this is the gripping story of that startup and how he eventually was found out and I don't really read much non-fiction that's not in the realm of either self-help or like entrepreneurship e stuff after hearing some people recommend this book and Bill Gates you said I couldn't put this trailer down I thought I'd give it a go and I'm really glad I did it feels like no non-fiction book like my audio non-fiction books is that they're boring or factual or stopping this I mean this could have been a fictional Thriller just as entertaining and over the course of about four days I'm on my cell replacement the moment so I have to get up at half past 6 in the mornings and usually out I'd like to get to bed by 11 so I can get 7 8 hours of sleep but in the 3-4 days I was reading this book I'm done up until like 3 a.m. every night just cuz I I literally couldn't put it down so if you're at all interested in reading a thriller about the whole Silicon Valley startup billionaire type stuff it's absolutely fantastic because obviously I read it on Kindle or just Amazon Prime with this because you know so I can show it off in this video so feel free to come in anything you want me to come in next month at the front and it's gold invest like the best butt of a crap name but they're really good podcast and it's run by God called Patrick O'Shaughnessy who runs his own Hedgehog Asset Management CEO of thing so he does interviews with people some of them are professional investors and they take a deep dive into investing and how they value companies and all that sort of stuff that you might be interested in if you enter into business or economics of finance and stuff about the episodes the most enjoyable when he was interviewing people that were outside few direct field investing so to podcast episodes I listen to this month number one with a chocolate Eugene way and secondly by chap called Tim Urban the first guy Eugene way I used to work for Amazon Idaho tech companies that he's now like a attack of locusts last journalists and he wrote a really really interesting article a couple weeks ago entitled status as a service which I would think in the video description it's a really really really long great but it's very interesting because it analyzes the success of very very social networks Facebook Instagram Snapchat is all based on the fact that we as humans Allstate to seeking monkeys and that we will do whatever we can to most efficiently maximize our social capital and come taking those two points of view signs of success. Facebook Instagram and Syed setup Drive had that also explains the behavior that people using those platforms tense of fall into a very wide range and ranging range top I already talked to some of the black-and-white single podcast episode of the top Link in the description below and you should definitely have listened to it and who you might know is the top behind the blog waitbutwhy which is one of the most well populele read blogs on the internet and that again was really very very interesting if you don't fall away but why it's probably the single block that I would recommend you follow if you only have to follow One login the Internet is just got an incredible array of articles are ranging from the start about Vice but also very good breakdowns of things like how Elon musk's companies fit into his why division he goes to go to Ted talk about motivation and procrastination and stuff that people always find particularly helpful but and this podcast episode is pretty good because Tim open breaks down his process of how he researches and creates old is incredible content and again they just talked on a load of other things I can possibly mention in that's like the best has a new book out that I've recently discovered and I'm it's now part of my weekly schedule of podcast listening I thought I was a protiviti know it but this guy do takes productivity notinos to like the next level * 10 as whole block block is about kind of about these like productivity tricks Ben systems and mindsets and hacks I just a generally novel way of dealing with work and dealing with all the responsibilities that we will have will have on the blood pressure to go into this was called building a second brain and unless he talks about his his system using various different apps organizing all of the various inputs into his life and I like things like news articles and books and to-do list and and all this stuff and how he then processes those using other side of apps and then how he outputs that into creating content for his blog and just generally being able to recall inside these hats routing content because a big problem that Anyone who reads A lot has is that you know you read something and then how do you then remember it and in this blog post building a second brain he talks about how I actually you should have an app something like Evernote that act as your second which means that as you read stuff you are going to summarizing get your distilling it's down it Down 2 Earth Essence in the new putting into Evan and then you'll send me regularly reviewing all that stuff so that you'd eventually build up this Treasure Trove of knowledge in your brain using your second to help with that that's very interesting blog post and then I'll try to read that it cut me down the whole Rabbit Hole of everything else in this website and now my unproductivity systems of changed I'm not quite his kind of 10x level of productivity and I'm experimenting with. Over the next few weeks and months and I'll have baby making some more videos about how I've Incorporated tiago's teaching into my own productivity Praxis Avalon and this is one of my favorite board games of all time and it has added as provided so many and hours of joy for me and my friends always first discovered this in our final year of medical school and then once we did it just completely transform the experience because when we were in the in the final few months preparing for a final exams almost every night at about 11 like might have my housemates the other medications I lived with congregate in my room weed order pizza or have some drinks or whatever and we were on the plane Avalon Avalon just so so good we play until like 2 or 3 in the morning he is so if you ever play the game Mafia or the game werewolf you'll know the premise basically the idea is that in these sorts of games there are some good Garden there's some bad guys for the bad guys know who the bad guys are for the good guys don't know anything and so it becomes a game of choking and trying to manipulate other people and trying to convince everyone that you're a good guy when you're actually bad guy trying to work together with the other bad guys to try and win the game where is the good guys in front of work together to figure out who the bad guys are based on how the game works and based on all this stuff because it's not a board game in the traditional sense and that the board is not the main focus but it's the conversations between people and the light on the truth and stuff that's my main focus and it created so so much drama so many Heat concussion and I undid up overdoing it a bit as wise one does but anyway Avalon the premise is that you know everyone in the group and its it suitable for between 5 and 10 players and a plate of those words everyone in the group are Adventure in the world of like King Arthur and you have to go in five different missions in each Mission takes a different number of people but the bad guys are trying to failed emissions and the good guys are trying to succeed emissions and So based on whether Mission succeeds or fails you can walkout basement who was on that mission whether they might be a good guy or bad guy so that's it doesn't mention with three people in it and it failed you know that at least one of those three people must be a bad guy until you incorporate that logic into the rest of your body language he's acting a bit shift to you I bet he's a bad guy she's a good guy that's what stuff and is also oldies extra characters like there's a guy called me because who knows who everyone else in the group we have to influence the game when he can but he called just come out and say guys I'm only the bad guys are Tom Dick and humza he has to do it in a Sly way because if the bad guys find out who murdered his they was mostly when somebody becomes an interesting character that's pulling the strings without trying to make he knows what's going on I'm in the special characters in the game becomes more advanced the more often you play at and this is something that even even now that we will graduated anytime we have a miscommunication like we had a last-second graduation ceremony a few months ago everyone came back to my place we ended up playing Avalon for about 4 hours so yeah if you don't have it already and you have a group of between five and 10 friends to play with guarantee it will add tons and tons of fun to your life so that's it for this video if you haven't subscribe to the channel that have a lovely day and I will see you in the next video when I pick up my voice back goodbye"

            "text": " last year I spent a stupidly large amount of money on this online course that changed my life is called building a second brain and it promises to supercharge your productivity and creativity and like I was already pretty good at the productivity stuff in terms of through the course I discovered the field of personal Knowledge Management which is like the next level of productivity and it really help me unlock and it's the next Frontier the main idea is that overtime you build up the second brain which is a digital note-taking system whereby anything that read watch and listen to that resonates with you goes into your system and then you can use your second brain to organize your ideas and thoughts you can ultimately convert them into your creative output in this area are going to go over the 10 fundamental principles of building a second brain so that you can also opportunity and creativity if you want to check out the code itself they'll be linked in the video description and very exciting they are now an official alumni Mentor for the course so when it happens with a live cohorts would happen twice a year I'll be joining and offering my expert but mentoring Services only lives in Kohl's because I derive value from this old stuff and if you're if you the right to a person if you are not it'll probably be worth it for you but it's definitely not for everyone and so this video you'll learn the 10 fundamental principles of you can start getting some of the knowledge from this course without having to pay for it the first principle is boro's creativity think of creativity as creating original stuff like I don't consider myself a very creative person because I feel like I don't really have any original ideas but one of the key insights from the course is that actually creativity is all about remix and stuff it's about taking ideas that already exist based on the things that you read what's on this and then I didn't even spend to them and see what combining things in interesting ways and that is what creativity is it's the resonate with you from all the stuff that you read what to Listen to If you have all that in one face it becomes a lot easier to start putting things together and start seeing connections that you would have seen before where is he trying to do that when you had it doesn't work as well as the capture habit is a fundamental part of productivity it's based around the idea that our brains are for having ideas not restoring them until it whenever we get any sort of idea whenever anything resonates with us in any way from anything in life even if we just walking down the parkour for in the shower if we listen you want to capture that idea as soon as possible because our brains are not going to hold onto it for very long. Of time since I took the course in 2019 I'm not start taking this very very seriously and so I have also two different mechanisms for capturing audio depending on where I get them listen to a podcast on audiobook in the car and on my Apple watch I will dictate to voice notes into dropped the app on my Apple watch and that'll singles matically with Evernote if I'm reading a book on Kindle app that will automatically sync to Evernote amazing up on a couple weeks ago I realized that when I was in the shower I was having so many ideas and I was just forgetting about them by the time I got out of the shower so I now have a waterproof Notebook on the windowsill next to the shower next to me and so if I have an idea I capture it right there and then because I know and brain is dumb ass and it's not going to hold on to that idea for very long is that ideas are not single-use like them but we have to recycle ideas and reuse them and so one of the things you want to do in can bring whatever note taking up with using for it as we want to keep track of all of the stuff that we're creating and all the idea that we using the CERN project cuz we can just reuse those ideas with others and talk to me whenever I not make a video or write a blog post or tree or anything goes my second brain because I know somewhere down the line I'm going to want to reuse some of that information and then it means that I've got these building blocks already that I can build other things out of so for example most of the online courses do I make very easily put together from building blocks from my brain based on this idea of idea recycling even while I was working full-time at the doctor I could turn out beat online cost of those just made us a stupid amount of money relative to my full-time job and the fact that I had all these ideas in my second brain system so that I can recycle them made the whole process infinitely easier principal at the idea of projects of the categories and this is one of the things are to take notes in the past but I would categorize things in terms of category like an interesting thing about marketing I put in a marketing folder in Evernote interesting thing about motivation I put in a motivation folder but then I'd end up with these two folders with lots of notes in them we have anything to do with them but now I think of it more in terms of projects and so if I capture an idea first aid goes into my kind of General capture inbox but then I will try my best to Associated to some kind of project that I'm currently working on because then the information is going to be what do useful brother. It just sitting in a bookmark folder that I'm never going to look at again next we have the principle of slow-burn and I think this is another really important aspect of my own personal productivity and that most of the things I do Oslo buns rather than heavy-lift you want to write a book or you want to make an online course anything right I'm going to go to a cabin in the woods and I'm going to sit down and do the thing and I'm going to do the work for 8 and a small amount of time and that'll be like your heavy lift like you you're lifting a very heavy load this project is like big a big thing that you have to do all at once and this sort of a heavy lift mentality and he'll at least for me it stops me from doing a lot of things cuz I think I haven't got the time to spend three weeks going to have heavy list buns and that's a big part of the building a second brain methodology and a main idea is that we have this list of projects that we working on and they're all kind of on the slow burner like for me right now for example I've got a handful of online courses and like books and other kind of products pipeline but I never sing down and got a bashing through them one at a time instead of them on the Slow Burn and overtime as I read and watch and listen to things and discover interesting ideas and come up with some of the time it's going straight into my second brain and into the relevant project the overtime instead of kind of doing a big project one at time I'm doing old Tennessee's projects like in very very very small amounts and not when it comes to me to spend a day consolidating all of the bits into the next go check laws for dump old is actually very put together because I've already done the work of the time it's not a happy list on sparkling with instead it's a slow burn that just by default through spending time on the internet and capturing notes into the right place in my second brain a kind of system for that and that's another really big place of having a note taking system that is connected to whatever thing you're using to keep track of your products on the principal at least to start with abundance and when we doing anything we all have the that we tend to start from a blank page have a blank page in front of us and we think right this is hard I don't really know what to do but I know the main thing in the second brain stuff is that if you have collected all the stuff of a time over your Inspirations and bits then you never really starting from scratch you always starting from abundance and so let's say you're using Evernote and you want to write an article about motivational productivity automatically that you have read and annotate to the major notes on over the last few years and you just going to draw from doesn't take bits from here and whatever you're making about motivation because you're queering dataset of stuff in your second brain. Just kind of changed the game because it means you'll never starting from a blank page you always starting with abundance who starting with this pre-existing Treasure Trove of information that you yourself have decided in the past that was worth saving you have the idea of intermediate packets and this something that I continue intuitively but I didn't really have the terminology for back in the day so if you imagine that's a year again by fille student and you're writing an essay actually it like we think of as like a big thing but actually it's made up of intermediate packets are used to code in content blocks in my head one of them it's like you know your introduction to the block I need to meet packet then you go maybe a paragraph or a section on short-term memory versus long-term memory and you have a section on the phonological loop spatial sketchpad which are aspects of working memory five or six different intermediate pockets and when you put them together they form an essay but one of the crucial insights which helps make students lives more efficient is that a load of these intermediate packets gas to put in different and so what I would do when I was at University and this was a method to help me breakfast and what I need to do is I would memorize the intermediate all the content blocks and then I'd be able to essentially in my head drag and drop them into whatever I say I wanted to that was a to memory for thumb and even outside the world of essay writing and it's really relevant like 10 principles of building second brain each of these ten principles all their own intermediate pocket and I know that in the future when I'm another kind of video or from writing blog post or from writing the book there are surely some aspect of this video some intermediate package that I can do drag and drop into my other thing so the first day thinking of that way really helps because it means that it's a lot easier to put stuff together for your next project but also anyway easier to get started on your car projects for example when I'm writing an essay I don't think of it is time I need to sit down and write the whole I say we should be more of a heavy lit I think of it as okay I just need to focus on the introduction or just need to write that one intermediate packet of short-term memory versus long-term memory what more durable because a big problem that me and getting started with doing work and if there's like a big mountain in front of us like watching a whole essay let me a packet of Ben Platt go into a second brain in the useful for future projects for the down the line but you only know what you make and this is like a big part of the building second brain saying this is a big part of my personal appeal as well these days is that like we can read listen to all the stuff that we want the stuff that we're really going to internalize and that's really going to affect our lives on that we can feasibly using a computer project is going to be the stuff that we have created ourselves the weather that reading a book and then writing a summary of it weather at listen to a podcast and turning it into like a tweetstorm of like inside from podcast or even if it's having random idea and then writing like flashing up that idea into an intermediate packet and checking into a second brain when we engage with material ourselves when does pregnancy material we end up becoming and then we can do interesting creative whatever things with that stuff and actually one of my biggest regrets in life is that I didn't start taking notes on stuff until like last year when I discovered the building II I really wish I've been doing this since like the age of 15 when I first started reading non-fiction books because if I'm on channel 202 books that are bright over the last decade of my life if I'd thought to summarize them or just just like quickly write up my insides I was thinking about was that I'd I'd come across from reading the book looking back at that now would have been such a huge Treasure Trove of information and now I'm having to come and go back through all the books I've ever read and unlike reread them and then summarize them and I really wish I could more as adults throwing up it doesn't matter what I use to start writing down the notes from all the stuff that you're reading because in 10 years time you going to be so glad that that's what you didn't want to make it easier for your future self and the way that I think of my second brain I hate my note taking apps that I use for different different things is that ultimately I'm putting in the work now to create a resource that my future self is going to find helpful and so wild right now I might be listening to a podcast and I hear the word I might be tempted to just write down what it means but that's no potentially useful to My Future Self because my brain is dumb I'm going to forget exactly what it meant and so I'll take a little bit of time right now to write a few notes on it to flush it out in my own words so that when future meat comes across this note on fractional analysis future me will know exactly what current me was talking about FIFA Straits me what I used to do back in the day where I live through my Evernote from like 2015 I think what the hell does that even mean like I don't remember what I was thinking when I take this note because I assumed too much Intelligence on the part of my of my future self and son I'm praying stuff I'm always thinking with my future self in mind equally if I'm studying for an exam and I'm using Anki flashcards or anything I'm thinking to myself my brain is a dumbass I'm not going to remember this therefore I need to create a flash card or create the note in a way that My Future Self will EZ be able to access it and that's another big part of the building second brain methodology principle is the idea that you want to keep your ideas moving and that's kind of this it's it's it's like an Auntie perfectionist take on this cuz one of the perhaps we can pull into if we're building out a note taking system is that we can fall into the Trap of protectionism what we think okay what right I've just discovered how to use notion I've watched all the videos of how to use notion 18 pieces of metadata sign for each one and we can get stuck kind of appreciating the intricacies of the app in the intricacies of our system rather than focusing on what matches which is to keep our ideas moving I'm get stuff kind of into a second brain and then organize it and distillery in Toronto converted into creative output because the most important thing is the output it really doesn't matter what in your second brain so what if you disable the podcast you listen to MSU doing something with that information into something or something or a planet life in some way it's completely useless and that's why I really like the principle of keep your ideas moving like it's not about having a perfect note taking system because there is no perfect note-taking system there is no perfect it's about having a system that just keeps flowing through it in an imperfect way and that's one of the key things. On the cortex. We don't have to worry about getting it right up front we can just kind of improve the system overtime and as long as we got crazy me out but that's the main thing the principles of building a second brain Paulo dybala links in the video description if you want to learn more to find out more about this I've done lots of other videos where I talked about this idea of personal Knowledge Management you can check those out and if you want to check out the court if you maybe want to be mentored by me live on wrinkles this year while we're going to the co-host then Link in the description check it out like I said it's super expensive for everyone if you're a student and you can't afford it then you know don't hate me for Creative professionals will making money off of this thing the lot price tag an investment in the future and your massive nut like me"

            "text": " weather in a personal or professional lives way constantly bombarded by external noise what if we could develop a mindset the both cut out that noise and help to clarify our own intentions free from the influence of others what if we could learn that mindset not from Top executives do the richest people in the world but instead from The Humble monk this is what monk and current celebrity YouTuber Jay Shetty talks about him from some of my favorite books in the book J takes the wisdom and traditions of monks and teaches us how we can apply them to live less anxious and more meaningful life drawing upon ancient wisdom and experience J outlines how the thinking of monks of his valuable lessons that are pertinent in the 21st century but he doesn't become monks and said he wants us to think like them to help combat the anxieties and precious that we face in the morning world divided into three parts that's letting go and giving and growing until we're going to discuss each of those intern and figure out what lessons take from the book to apply to run Life Part 1 is about letting go and this revolves around full keep it has funding or identity reducing negativity detaching from fear and learning to live intentionally address or identity chicken wrapped up in our values he points out that actually a lot of the values that we think we hold don't necessarily our own but we've acquired them through societal conditioning he writes the opinions expectations and obligations of the world around us we begin hear ourselves and the idea is that if we can fill out this noise and give us the space to consider our own values then we can begin to direct Our Lives to what higher values like gratitude service truthfulness and compassion which ultimately propellers to What happiness fulfillment in meaning and away from lower values like greed lust anger and envy which ultimately just push us towards anxiety depression and suffering the next part of letting go is addressing negativity and affect your day and kind of get to you in a way that you would like but Jay says in the book negativity is a trait not someone's identity and so we can learn to let it go monks talk about the process of awareness addressing and amending which J distills down to a three stay process of spot stop and Swap this three-part process of observing reflecting and then modifying our Behavior it's Carnival the stoics you to talk about as well and it's a really good way of addressing negativity monks beliefs of the root cause of fear is closely related to attachment or on need to own or control things if the cause of fear is attachment Jay says that the cure for fear is detachment Detachment is not that you should owe nothing but that nothing should own you again this is a classic stoicism concept that I think about a lot when it comes to being attached to stuff like keyboards a preferred indifference that I can prefer to have a 49 inch ultrawide monitor with keyboard mouse but it's ultimately an indifferent I don't need it to be happy I'm not attached to it so that we can live more intentionally motivations revolve around fear desire Duty and love and he talks about the Y ladder as a way of understanding or tribulations of doing stuff behind because it involves questioning ourselves until we can get to the root of our intentions so if I were to ask myself why did I want to make YouTube videos one reason might be because I wanted to teach people I wanted to help people in Inspire others all things like that but if I was one that I want to do that I probably stay well I want to do that because it seems like fun and if I lost why does that seem like fun that I might get to the true colors which is secretly like crazy admiration and respect of other people and that's why making YouTube videos like this one stop negativity and without fear we can begin to let go of the stuff that's been holding us back and we can make space for the second part of the book which talks about growth as would let him go growth also revolves around some key principles which include finding a purpose training on mind and mouth during auriga if we start with purpose Jay talks about how we can identify on Pharma which is a Sanskrit term that roughly translated English to your clothing he says that funding atama isn't just about figuring out our passion and skill but it's about figuring out a passion and skill that we have that can also useful Talbots and so passion plus expertise plus usefulness equals and, which is our passion becomes our purpose when we use it to serve others if you're like me and you haven't quite figured out what your Dharma or your purpose or your mission or your calling in life is than one Mythic ring this out is by using the quadrants of potential as they pulled too many of us spent most of all days in quadrant 1 skill no passion for passion no skill but the actually grow and develop a purpose we should aspire to be in quadrant 2 compassion so that was spending of time using our talents doing what we love by combining passion with expertise in the service of others crochet that helps us figure out a purpose I figure out where we going to go about it which is that what do I enjoy what am I good at and what will the market pay me for and the market will pay me for something is sort of a proxy for this is useful to other people so that's another way of framing it if you find the sort of idea of how can this be useful to other a little bit hard to wrap your head around step one along this journey of personal growth is finding a purpose and then step to is developing the right mindset and he gives us a comparison between the monk mind and the monkey mind thinking dizziness and switches Amos Lee on the other hand blisters out of our confusion and distraction and helps us find polarity meaning and direction framework or a variant of it which is Sport stop and Swap and so if we find ourselves thinking a destructive positive thought which itself takes some like practice we observe it so we spoke and then we stop thinking like it and then we swap it for something else this is so much easier said than done but it is ultimately the foundation that also things like cognitive behavioral therapy stuff restaurant decided that yes we can control our thoughts and our actions but it's only through practice that we can actually do any way of getting a monkey ego Jay talks about how the monks teach that our ego is one of the main obstacles to a growth and in fact most of our egos are Too Faced in that one moment is telling us that way the best and the next moment is telling us that we have to do what a mind wants to take us to one of these extreme and instead opting for a middle ground where we're activity recognizing eyewitnesses and working to improve on them until we need to remember the bad that we've done to others the good others have done for us and we need to forget the good that we've done for others and the but others have done to us and if we can do this consistently we are generally increasing or ingratitude should we put out to the world which is always going to be a good thing the father is probably the most important and it talks about how we can learn to look Beyond just ourselves and instead think about how we might act in service to other people the previous ideas of Letting Go and growing their ultimate detaching ourselves from our own selfishness so that we're in a position to give back to society and two others through service the others we actually feel good about ourselves when he says in the book that selflessness heals the South Pheasant when you go off to compassionate goals like seven other people in some way that actually leads to your own increased in a few happiness and contentment some cells talk about the four different ways in which giving service to other people helps us Elvis Presley If you have to actually go out into the world to help other people or put yourself out there like giving to others and helping other people helps us realize like how grateful we are for the things that we do have suddenly increases compassion I eat helps open up our eyes to the needs of other people which again is a good thing for us elves unfold me if Bill self esteem by giving us a mission and a meaning Beyond satisfying the South ultimately thinking like a monk might seem like a bit of an abstract idea but in the introduction like given the amount of anxiety and hecticness and frenetic knows that we've got in the world why wouldn't we learn from the people who are calm peaceful and happy like monks but overall think like a monk very good book definitely worth reading that's going to be a link in the description if you want to pick yourself up a couple if you haven't got it yet again in this video I've only touched on a sliver of the surface of the ideas in here there's a lot more stuff he Illustrated with lots of stories and of course you can check out Jay-Z YouTube channel which is a constant source of inspiration for many millions people and Jay if you watching this we should go out sometime if you like this episode episode of the obstacle is the way which covers similar themes to think like a monk but approaches it from the lens of stoicism using lots of historical examples to check that out of that watching

Right about where is like it shows that if you have Greenery in your office when you're working space that increases creativity so that was what I told myself when I was buying no. I just wanted to copy every other Tech YouTuber behind me we have a kentia palm which is a pretty good house plant is quite hard to kill as quite study at the motor about once a week my mom vetoed the idea of me having fake plants in the house but you let me keep this one because we know how it already and it would have to waste money from the house a real or just cuz I do have to remember to water them once a week but you know as a twenty-five-year-old don't know who pay bills and taxes in penis I thought you died from 3 I don't have to rock and so I find that when I'm sitting in front of my desk all day I do actually have to work my core a little bit just to stay upright and then on the right hand side of the desk we put to Alex drawer units from Ikea again is the best job I've ever what cable management on this job is done and just makes it really easy because it's got these metal bits underneath that are quite good at holding cables on the side of the boat so much space on the right hand side by the Alex drawer unit so I mean that the whole mess of cables and plugged in all that stuff is sitting behind a you can't really see them have a deck of cards with me I've been into close-up magic and stuff like that since the age of 17 so when was that was eight years ago while that's a long time answer whenever I'm watching something on YouTube or if I have then I just got off the deck of cards clam wraps which is like the first initial of eights of my University friends as Rachel very wholesome minutes go to the different symbols that symbolize different bits of a holiday that we all went on together and actually watching documentaries on Monday on this monstrosity of a 49 inch monitor while having food and like I'm not really was proper TV for the last like 5 years and stone university cuz I just kind of thought of watching TV is a waste of time but since I discovered documentaries recently changed my mind on that front watching stuff that actually helps and that hopefully it seemed to segue into curiositystream for a very cloudy sponsoring this video.

            "text": " right so let's say you want to get started with this investing thing you might have a bit of money saved is probably not enough for a house but you reckon I should probably invest in something maybe you heard the news about Tesla on Netflix or Amazon in the how if you'd invested 10 years ago in Tesla then you'd be able to if you need to the games whole investment things can seem like a really complicated blackbox like how do you even by a stalk what even is a stolen you just go and tesla.com and buy some Tesla like how does it work run around like a Roth IRA and 401K in America or like I says and license in the UK I don't suppose that there's the anxiety that we all have that investing is risky and I don't want to lose all of my money I wish I would have had five years ago when I first started investing in stock Sanchez I'm going to cover this by thinking about investing in 10 different but size step so the first one is forgetting about investing completely and just thinking what happens to my money over time can I mix you will know that your money loses its value over time thanks to something cool inflation inflation is generally around about the 2% two and a half percent Mark and so that means that every year stuff cost about 2% more than it did the year before temple in 1970 in America a cup of coffee cost $0.25 but in 2019 that same cup of coffee cost $1 fifty-nine dollars inflation in action and so let's say you've got a thousand pounds newham right now and for the next 10 years you just stash it under your mattress funniest time you'll thousand pounds is not going to be worth a thousand pounds anymore because everything would have increased by 2% every year so the value of your money for the folder answer if you put your thousand pounds under your mattress for 10 years you will lose money or the time and this is obviously not even if you put your money savings account like these days a savings account will give you like 0.2% interest which means your money goes up by 0.2% every year but because inflation is up by 2% you will still losing money over time and again a money from losing value of a time if we had a hypothetical savings account one that was let's say an interest rate of 2.5% that would match roughly the rate of inflation so inflation means everything goes up by 2.5% and the price what's a money in a savings account by 2.5% each year therefore we technically not losing money or the time you have an issue with the word interest and stick to it for now investment is not the same as interest but will come back Saturday not lose money which is what happens at a 2.5% rate we actually want to make money and that brings us on to question of the three witches well how do we actually make money. Let's go back to a hypothetical savings account way too high but hypothetically if it did that means that every year would be making 10% of the value of the money in a savings account so for example if I would have put a hundred pounds in a savings account right now but next year will be 110 and then the year after will be 121 because it's 10% of them 810 830 something and this would very quickly compound so that in 10 years time my 100lb will have to come 259 lb and if we adjust for inflation that our money is still worth 206 lb in 10 years time this is we have more than doubled our money but just putting it in this hypothetical 10% interest savings account and it really doesn't seem like you would do that because 10% feels like a small amount of money but if you extrapolate 10% of a 10 years accounts don't really exist because it's just way too high and real life is not that nice these days most savings accounts in the UK and I imagine around the rest of the world as well offer less than a 1% savings right which means you actually still losing money of time but we do have other things to try and get us to this magical Nirvana of like you know this 10% saving thingy and that is way Investments coming so put them for is what is an investment and the answer is that an investment is something that puts money in your pocket for example let's say you buy a house for $100,000 you want to rent it out to people there are two ways that's an investment there are two ways to make money from it but I say let's say you're charging some wrench to the people living in your house that's a good charging them 850 lb a month 10000 pounds a year and so every year making 10000 pounds in rental income which is 10% of what you originally pay for the house that means that in ten years time you looked paid off the hundred thousand pounds do you put in a year and every year you just making 10000 pounds in pure profit so that's pretty good because the value of the house itself would probably rise of a time in general there was a trend in most developed countries the house prices tend to rise over the long-term and so you'll house will probably be worth more than a hundred thousand pounds in ten years time and in fact in the historically in the past some people have said that house prices have doubled every 10 years so maybe your house is worth close to 200,000 pounds and so you made money off of the rental income but you've also made money off of the Capitals game which is what we call it when an asset increases in value but the problem is that buying a house is a little bit annoying you need to have quite a large amount of money for a deposit you need to get a mortgage me to actually have the house you just bought at The Rental Management rent out to people all that kind of stuff if only there were a way of investing without a having a large amount of money to start with beat without having to put that much effort into managing the asset as well and that bring the song to investing in shares and for me basically 100% of my Investment Portfolio is entirely shared in Bitcoin and I own this house but I'll talk about that in a different video that 4.5 is what are shares and how do they work so buying shares as probably as close as we're ever going to get to this medical savings account that just returns so amount of money each year when you buy a share you are buying a hot ownership of the company that you go to Sharon for example let's say the Apple have a particularly profitable year because people have bought iPad as per my recommendation because they are choosing to pay out a dividends to their shareholders a dividend of a million pounds and that's going to be split evenly amongst whoever owns shares in apple based on how many shows they are so if you happen to own 1% of Apple you would get 1% of that dividend the Deschutes 1% of a million pounds what team is actually under 1% of Apple unless Tim Cook you're watching I don't even know if you have that much because that would make you extremely rich person because apple is a very valuable company invest in the company and therefore you make money through dividends II way of making money from Chaz is sort of like with houses in that you get the capital gains of a Time example let's say you bought 10 shares in apple in 2010 by the time those shares selling for $9 each so you spent $2 on buying 10 shares in apple as of October 2020 Apple shares sell for $115 so you're 10 Shares are not worth $1,150 just by the fact that you're only paid $90 for them 10 years ago and how you make money and at this point you probably got a few questions like how much money you need to get started or how risky is buying shares in a company and I promise we're going to get to that but point of a 6 is how the hell do you buy a share in the Best Buy and this is where I can kind of get complicated because it's not as simple as by and just buying a share in apple it doesn't quite work like that and said you have to go through what school a broker and the back-in-the-day a stockbroker was a physical person usually a dude who you would call on the phone and say hey bub I want to place an order for some shares in apple and then play some stuff into his computer or place like a paper order and then you would own shares in apple finally these days we don't really have to talk to but because his loads and loads of online Brokers instead and so you make an account on an online Broker Than you can buy shares in a company through that run different Brokers the Opera in that country because to be an online broker to come for you have to abide by like a zillion different laws and so in the UK the system is different to the US which is Germany and so on you can also open an investment account with them and then invest online but usually the interface is a bit clunky it's a bit old-fashioned and so you usually better off going with an online broker in the UK the two that I use are Charles Stanley direct and Vanguard but before we get ahead of ourselves and make an account on Vanguard please understand a few more things answer question number 7 is how the hell do I decide which chest to buy the easy answer to that is that you actually don't want to figure out which has to buy you do not want to buy individual shares and I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that once I've had a haircut so see you shortly all right so you have got my Invisalign Braces once I'm going to sound a little bit different but why were we oh yeah we were talking about why it's not a good idea generally speaking to invest in individual stocks and I'm going to do a video about this some other time but essentially issues with investing in individual stocks is it's kind of risky like yes if you invest in something like apple chances are it's going to be around 10 years from now but historically they've been quite a few companies that people were like oh my God this is amazing this is the thing and that company went bust so you automatically exposing yourself to more risk if you are investing in individual stop also in general like it's easy to say hey it's going to continue to do the same for the next predict the future and the past is no real indication of future performance answer the advice that most people get for beginners is that you should not invest in individual stocks you should invest in index funds and this is what Graham Stephan when he says the end the best safest and easiest long-term investment strategy for most people which begs the question what number what the hell is an index fund set this basically two bits to understand that start with an a fund is basically where investors will pool multiple investors would invest in the same fun and then that fun would have a fund manager and the funds manager decides which companies the fund is going to invest it and I called it and bring people for my audience invest in my Gringos want I as the fund manager can say OK the Gringos fun now that we have a hundred people's money let's say is a hundred million so everyone's investor 1 million each I've now got a hundred million I'm going to put 20% of that Apple 10% in Facebook Netflix temperature in Johnson & Johnson all that stuff and so you the investor don't have to worry about this because you trust me and my phone to bring up to manage your money and as you know the fun performs well cuz the prices of these they start Sanchez increases you get the returns and I take a 1 or 2% management fee so I make a lot of money because I'm off of this a hundred million that I'm managing and you're not worrying about having to pick stocks yourself you trust me as a seasoned professional to do to do that for you what a fun day is Navi index that refers to a stock market index answer a stock market index would for example BB ftse 100 which is 300 biggest companies in the UK or the S&P 500 vs d500 biggest companies in the US or the NASDAQ different indices of the stock market and if we use the S&P 500 for example these are the components of the S&P 500 Siri said it's the 500 biggest companies in the US so number one is Apple and apple makes up 6.5% of the S&P Microsoft make the 5.5 Amazon makes a 4.7 Facebook is 2.2 alphabet which of the Google makes 1.5 in 1.5 so about 3% of the total S&P 500 and essentially we could leave 500 companies you go all the way down Ralph Lauren is 496 but chances are you've not really heard of many of the but chances are you've heard of most of the company's towards the top of the list so the S&P 500 is an index of the u.s. stock market and if you look at the performance as a whole of the S&P 500 you get a general idea of how the US economy is going as a this is Cottonwood S&P 500 looks like and if we do a 5 your time Horizon if I click the max you can see another S&P 500 started in 1980 and since that time this is what the US Stock Market has been doing since there is a general Trend upward but for example in 2000 crash in 2008 family that was a bit of a crash this year when coronavirus for starting to be a thing it was a bit of a crush but then the market basically in need to be recovered off the okay so we know of might we know what index is like something like the S&P 500 when you combine those you get an index fund which is a fund that automatically invest in all of the companies in the index and sew with me for example basically all of my investments for my money is in the S&P 5 which effectively means that 6.5% of my investments on Apple 5.5 or Microsoft 4.7 Amazon 2.2 in Facebook 3% of Google 1.5 in Berkshire Hathaway and so pretty easy to invest in a big problem that bigoness have to invest in his light well how the hell do I know which company to invest in how do I read a balance sheet how do I do any of this stuff if you invest in index funds you actually don't have to worry about any of that secondly index funds give you a decent amount of diversification soda companies in the S&P 500 so you're not entirely reliant on the tech sector or the oil sector or the clothing sector or anything to make the bulk of the money you are very nicely Diversified across oldies us companies Sunday index funds have very low fees so big it's not a real person who is deciding you know what to invest in and doing all this research and trying to make less money is essentially a computer algorithm that will automatically allocates the money unit based on the components of the index fund the fees for those are really low about investing for the long time is that even a slight increase in your face it's going to massively impact your financial upside answer for example an index fund with a 0.1% fee is so much better for you that an actively managed fund where I found the manager is charging you even want to I think it's a long time difference between 0.1% and 1% fees is absolutely astronomical over the long time and finally if you look historically and you know technically historical performance is not the same thing as performance but he is very few funds have managed to act consistently beat the market outperform the index and infect someone like Warren Buffett famous he says that if you gave him a hundred thousand pounds and asked him to invest it right now he would just invest in an index funds like the S&P 500 in fact in 2008 Warren Buffett challenge the hedge fund industry try and beat the market he said that headphones are bit pointless because they charge way too high fees and they don't actually get the soda returns that claim to get and so he set up this ten-year bet switch this company called Protege Partners LLC accepted what Buffett said good bets of the index funds outperform the actively managed fund and he ended up winning that bet the money but that just goes to show that it's really hard to beat the market with an actively managed fund basically no one can predict what the market I do in the future and therefore if you hitch a ride on index I eat your gambling on the entire Market rather than thinking you know what I've got some kind of amazing inside the I'll know exactly which tensed up the pig they're going to be tomorrow you might as well hitch a ride with the whole Market rather than individual stocks is that the problem of which stock to invest in bike completely circumventing the problem and instead just investing in index funds the next big question people usually have about investing in stocks and shares is the amount of risk and that brings us to point of a 9 and the argument usually goes as follows okay cool this investing in stocks and shares stop sounds kind of interesting but my Uncle Tom cobley invested lots of money in the stock market and he lost a lot of money and my parents are told me that investing in the stock market is really risky thing and I shouldn't do it instead invest in real estate real estate that is usually the sort of thing that this would have idea that people have about investing in stocks I'm not sure either has anxiety of what if I lose all my money so let's talk about that now so if we take a step back the only way to lose money in anything is if you buy a thing and then you said it for less than you actually bought it like let's say you bought a house with 300,000 pounds and then break that happens the next day and the house prices plummet and now your house is only with 250,000 at that point if you decide to sell your house then yes you are losing money and you lost $50,000 equally the only way to really lose money in stocks as if you buy a stock at a certain price and then you sell it for less than the price on the 18th of February 2017 can you keep on looking at the price of the Apple stock because every day you thinking to have I made money have you made money I'm really lonely for you you see the over the next few days if you wakes Apple stock is actually going down and then on the 18th of March 2020 you decide to screw it I'm going to sell my because I don't want to and you sell it for me the price of $61.67 and so you technically lost $18 because you bought it at $79 in February and you sold it for $61 in March then you think that I'm I've lost 20% of my investment the stock market invest in the stock market and you quit this would be a very bad thing to do because for example if we look at Apple stock price in March it was $57 31 but she just held onto your one Apple Apple share in that time what what is it today it's the 8th of October is not raining $114.96 so if you just held on for a few months you'll actually made a lot of money you would have bought it at $79 and within 8 months it would not be worth $115 that's a pretty good game and so the real lesson when you're investing in stocks and shares Isa when you're investing in real estate these are long-term investment ideally you shouldn't be putting any money into stocks and shares that you need to access within the next 5 years and actually do people extend that to 10 years and it's exactly like that buy a house as an investment house prices go down it would be completely stupid if you to sell the house unless you are absolutely desperate for the money because something major has happened and instead if you just held on to the house then you would have made more money in the long run because in the long-term house prices of a cup the long-term basically the stock market always goes up and that's a bit of a can be controversial statement it is true but I'm going to make a video at some other point explain why is true but for now take over the long-term the stock market always goes up but having said that something and so for example if he if we look at the S&P 500 and look at how it was in 2008 at the financial crash right in 2007 it's $1,500 bit of the S&P 500 and then the crash happened and then what is it January to September 2009 is down to 735 to basically 50% of the values going white off out of the S&P 500 now if you bought it in 2007 and you saw it you can get a crushing and crushing it and then you sold when it was $800 now you've lost a lot of money because you both high and you solo but if you just held on it took so you know that's a June 2017 1500 it takes about up until 2013 five years for it to get back to its normal level and even if you'd invested like just before the crash and then your Investments limited by 50% if you would just tell them you have going at the S&P 500 1500 and right now it would be 3,000 1045 Just Dance 2018 2017 first invested over the last 500 has more than doubled so you would have more than doubled your money provided you did not panic sell when the market crashed crashed down to zero therefore you will actually lose all your money yes it could but if the US Stock Market crash today 320 I ate whole top 500 companies in the S&P 500 the world would be in some sort of Mega apocalypse and you'd have a lot more serious problems to worry about rather than the value of your portfolio of stock market indices in the season on Vanguard in that scenario and not doomsday scenario Woodstock meaning anything and you be using money to wipe your bum because money has no value because the stock market since it's it's basically unfathomable that the global economy could be so completely wrecked such that every single company goes down to zero in my opinion yeah I noticed it's unrealistic to think that if I put my money in stocks and shares I could lose all of it there's basically no way you're ever going to lose all of it provided your diversify if you invested in I don't know Myspace 10 mm whatever it was and then Myspace crashes and then you lost all your money because they have no money but if you invest in the top 500 companies in the US or you know the top 5 companies in the world or the top 100 companies in the UK it is so vanishingly unlikely that you'll ever lose your money that don't think that is a risk that we should even be thinking about so realistic was case scenario yes investing in the stock market is risky in the short time that you're investing in the long-term the market will always go up and you will always end up making more money in the long run it provided you don't have to take money out okay so this point we've established that investing in stocks is very good and investing in index funds is a relatively safe way of doing this the next question is usually when should you get started like how old do you have to be is it to its is ever too soon to start is ever too late to stop sounds pretty simple and basically all investment advice agrees with me on this front there's a very good website called The Motley Fool at fool.com and they have a nice article explaining that basically you should start investing as soon as possible it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how young you are do you start investing the best there are three caveats there for like sensible fashion advice. You want to make sure that all of you high interest credit card debt is paid off because when it comes to compounding even though games compound Los Compadres well answer if you got like a 6% credit that's eating into your bottom line every single month you want to pay that off as soon as possible Whenever two is that you want to make some sort of emergency fund and people usually say that your emergency fund should have in cash basically three to six months of living expenses so that if you lose your job or if you hit your head with some kind of incredible medical emergency and you're not in the UK where Medical Care is Frio you're in the USS Langley. Then you've got money to do that and you don't have to take money out of your investment number three is that you don't want to put any money into what's that you think you might need to use in the next 3 to 5 years so let's say you're 24 and you've just love your first job and you're thinking of getting a mortgage and buying a house and you need money for the deposit do not put that money into the S&P 500 or into any kind of Stockton because no one can't unlock it and no one knows whether we might you know the monthly market crash tomorrow but we know is that in the long-term stock market goes up but if you need to buy a house next year there is absolutely no guarantee that that money will still be worth exactly the same or what this time next year so provided those two conditions on that Express that you have no high interest credit card debt and second date you've already got your emergency fund and the day you're not planning to get a have a major expense in the next few years at that point and absolutely everyone should besting something into the stock market in my opinion whether you're 12 or 20 or 21 or 22 250 it doesn't matter there is no way your future self will regret making the decision to invest more time you leave your money in the stock market in the more it compounds and there is a huge difference that's like lots of interesting numbers about this on the internet that people have calculated that if you start investing at the age of 20 vs if you start investing at the age of 25 or 30 it makes such a huge difference. find that basically as soon as you watch this video and hear about investing you should start investing provided those three conditions that we talked about I meant 11 out of 12 where we said okay you sold me inside investing in index funds or these three conditions I'm at suspect caught that I've got my emergency fund or I'm a student and therefore my parents are my messages and I'm not trying to buy a house or a big thing in the next three years that ask questions usually how much money do I need to get started with investing and I know those students what's my channel and Trump saying I'm 14 years old and I don't have any money how do I get started with investing easy basically start with whatever you can do some of these websites and some of these apps that you can use to invest in stock market indices you can start with as little as $5 or 10 lb depending on the website you might need to stop at a hundred thousand pounds you can research this and it kind of depends on which country you rent but basically you want to start investing as soon as possible and it doesn't matter if it's a tiny amount of money to begin with firstly it if you supposed to invest second and more importantly the sooner you start investing the sooner it becomes a habit and sofa me for example I started investing in 2015 I knew absolutely nothing about it before then but I really wish I'd started investing in like 2009 when I first had my first part-time job add that would have encouraged the good financial habits with Annie I would have kept aside maybe 10% or 20% from the Top Line different investment secondly it would have meant that investing became a habit and so I would have known about the fact that stock market indices exist research I would watch videos like this these want anything in 2009 and what I'm really annoyed about with myself as I started making actual money in like 2012 when my first business started to do very well and between 2012 and 2015 I did not invest any money because I didn't know that you could and I didn't know how and I was kind of thought that huh I'm making money now it's just over thirty sitting in my bank account and I know that inflation something so I know my money is losing value but I just didn't think about investing and didn't realize how easy it isn't that it's a thing and so I really wish I'd started investing money in 2012 would have done that is if I start investing from 2009 when I first started making I don't have 6 pounds an hour to dream of hearts on job so again and accounts enough like it it doesn't matter if you have it the process of making the account and researching online stock Brokers new country in figuring out how to actually do the stuff is like the most valuable thing to eat we doing with your time we need to be after watching this video apakah Index Fund how do I actually do that online broker so this will have like zillions of lost to have to comply with regulations in the US most people on my favorite Logan mr. money Moustache recommence that's well within the US are also other services like Benjamin switch I put a few friends who use that as well again depending on which country we have to do is Google the phrase best online broker Germany or best online broker Pakistan or Beth Elohim Brooklyn what country you're in and you'll find something recent reviews basically the thing you're looking for if you want to be able to invest in index funds anyone the Seas to be as low as possible I think Charles Stanley direct the sea is 0.25% which was the lowest at the time when I made my account and I think still pretty competitive cu1 defeat to be like a really really small fraction of a percentage putting money in here and there an old friend that I've spoken to about the stuff over the lost like four years since I first started knowing about investing in things they will start making accounts and making these investment counsel themselves for the first few weeks they always impulsive see what the stock market's doing then very quickly realize that actually investing for the long time here I actually don't give a toss what the stock market is doing the short time I'm going to check my port like I check my portfolio once every 6 months just cuz sometimes I'm curious I don't even bother looking at it this is very much a special you are investing for the long-term good money will magically pro at a time provided you don't touch it and think I'll crap store has been down a bit I'm going to take my money cuz I kind of was a reasonable introduction to how to get started with investing in index funds if you have more questions about exactly what to do or anything else about money do leave a comment in the video description area thing to think of a name for the series I was thinking Instagram there were few options money talks with quite a popular one but that's already a film won the ivy life with Penicillin thing Michael the series Penny said I was kind of cool people said like financially financially financially let me know what you think have any idea as to what this entire series about money and stuff should be cooled and final piece of advice if you're in the UK thing basically go down and make a life by myself cityxguide.com 20/20 you can pull up to 4,000 pounds a year into it and then you can invest in the S&P 500 which is what I would do if you have more than four thousand pounds a year to invest you can then put another 16000 inch waist how to get more than 20,000 open a general investment account with Vanguard this will I do I think it looks great description to other resources and bloggers and books and other video so I would recommend Grandstaff an amazing job with YouTube well mr. Money Mustache amazing amazing frog jlcollinsnh amazing blow with a fantastic stock series that you definitely read this so much to explore in this area online investing make sure you invest in the stock market index fund that hopefully I'll see you in the next week"

The door frame and I land on my knees during my lower back at the base of my spine in the process my trainer then kindly suggest that we start to workout for today as it focuses a lot on core and back

            "text": " play friends welcome back the channel this is going to be a bit of a chit-chat rumbly video where I talk about my feelings with a cup of chamomile tea so if you want my toxic relationship with this is something I very recently realized and it was a it was a real shock to me as well as I'm sure it is for you guys watching this if you've been following the tunnel of any any length of time the way it happened was a few weeks ago I started feeling like I was in this like real kind of productivity in that when it came to like filming videos for a period of about three weeks every time I found a video I just said I did really couldn't be bothered to ask video but because I have like you know how much do the metro into my heart that consistency is like the most important thing in life and this fear when you are YouTuber that'll all YouTubers have that you know I icon possibly take a break from YouTube because if I do then the algorithm is going to be mean to me Holland MI career going to go downhill and then I'm going to have to have to end up being a doctor again. Thought process was on steroids. At 3 weeks and everytime I I filmed a video it was like a real not everything has to be fun 100% of the time there are times or we do have to push through and do stuff but generally the secret to my productivity for the last 15 years of my life has been that everything I do I'm broadly enjoy and like 90% enjoy maybe if I have to push through the final 10% will usually the first 10% in intensive getting started that's just a bit to take a bit of pushing but in this in this. Of three weeks it was like every aspect these videos needed that. Like you know uphill pushing it wasn't a nice feeling to do something activating not enjoying but doing it because I felt like I had to because of the algorithm for example in the mornings I would have liked a cola phone colder like an artisan or what scheduled at like 9 or 10:00 in the morning and I just live wake up Larry I do you know in like 3 minutes before I'd like you know pretend to be bright and alert and like awaken stuff but likes eating resentment inside of me that I don't have to give it away because it's it's not like anyone was forcing me to do this like I am completely in control of my own schedule and I had chosen to begin our Listen to Workout Cindy's phone calls and chats about my book all the stuff in the mornings thinking you know a few weeks prior that this will be good this will get me out of bed and then when it came to that it was a feeling of like like hating my full myself for booking in these things in the morning and then after few days of this idle so do that thing which county does award for it it's called Revenge bedtime procrastination where where the thing that we have where you like you know it's past your bedtime but your you don't want to go to bed and you just like procrastinate until I was like spending time to time to scrolling through Instagram and Twitter just absolutely no reason until one 2 in the morning my house machine told me this is called Revenge bedtime procrastination where which is a phenomenon whereby you feel you don't have control over the rest of your day and so the only bit of your day that you do have control over IE nighttime that's when you bring something besides you know I'm the boss going to go to bed and you end up screwing yourself or the next day and then the final piece of feeling of dissatisfaction of the end of the day being like Oh I didn't do enough today I woke up too late or I deleted that that meeting was unproductive enough or I only filled one video when I should have done three videos and I should have I should have done full video thing one thing and I'm not really a stranger to this feeling of dissatisfaction like this is often how I feel but it's like I don't like it's it's rare for me to feel like there multiple days in a row and it is imperative like 2 or 3 weeks it was just sort of alternative Hayes in the I don't really remember what happened like what I asked you did in those days like I look back on my calendar from liking a few weeks ago and that in the end up here to three weeks I just think them I don't remember any of this is a don't really remember it happening and that is also a little scary feeling and so all of this stuff maybe it's burnout I've never experienced brought up before I don't know what that supposed to mean but maybe that's what that feeling is like where where you feel like he's coming by this do anything like the work that you're having to do things like a real a real struggle but I was like psychoanalyzing myself earlier I came up with a few different reasons as to why this was happening and then once I've discovered the reasons behind why was happening I found some solutions to it so that's what about those in the biggest reason is Independence like I was fixated to certain like outcomes that were outside of my control this is normally something that I very much rail against I don't believe in setting output goals I E I don't believe him if I make a video I do believe in the concept of having a kind of view counts like all I really want this video to hit this many views already want to have this many subscribers that's a dumb cuz that stuff is outside of my control in almost every aspect of my life I set input goals and stuff like I'm just going to make two videos a weekend cuz nothing within my control control a few weeks ago January 20-21 we drop down for three videos a week to two videos a week and because of that broke down I was thinking Okay cool so now we're doing fewer videos that for all of these big need to be absolute bangers and I kind of have that in my mind. I want every video to be a banker do you want every video to be a banger like there that there is only so far. Particular do process can go cuz maybe if you're lucky a video as YouTube Studio shows you which is like 10 out of 10 on the analytics 10 out of 10 meaning in your previous 10 videos it's the 10th worth of Fulmer and a top-10 on YouTube Studio thing like oh my God my life is over like what's the point my YouTube channel thing down the drain I think it was because for some reason I said this intention in my head that hey I want to make banga videos every time and that intention made me fixated on the outcome of the video like how well is so that I was becoming like obsessed with YouTube analytics and thinking oh my God this videos only go to thumbnail picture right at like 9.8% we need to get our nails and essentially this Loop of trying to optimize the numbers for the last bring up years on YouTube I have Brody not really cared about the numbers like I couldn't care less Wonder video comes out how it performed generally alongside I had a lot of alcohol dependence writing the book that I'm working on before John McPhee on the writing process which is helping me learn how to write but I'll put it a video up there that talks about how I feel like way to the last six months of intensive writing the book what's happening around the same time when I buy an adjustment for a bit of background I've got a book deal and I'm writing a book this or two goals that can happen writing a book one of them which is which is the external goal which is that I really want this book to hit the New York Times bestseller list such a dumb stupid arbitrary goal to have because it's completely out of my control and it's stupid but for some reason and so when I was writing the book anytime I write something I'll be thinking oh my God this is total junk this is not very good and I thought to be hating myself as I was trying to write knowing that my work wasn't very good at all and radios roll. Entire problem was just around setting outcome goals rather than the second cause of this kind of toxic relationship with discovered is that I don't pay enough attention to my emotional states often if I don't feel like doing something I will do it weighing like push through the pain and like it always do anyway especially when it comes to making videos like you know like 350 videos of something on this channel so far it's been on a two-point something videos a week since June of 2017 and to get consistency while hopefully keeping the quality up everytime I have to kind of force myself to get started feeling in my phone cuz I love the sound of my voice and it's quite fun talking to a camera in a way that's a sweet but when it comes to this this thing like if if you're a complete waste on and you spend your toilet playing play World of Warcraft then there is a level at which you have to tell yourself I'm going to do something even if I don't feel like it I'm going to get off the sofa get off my chair playing World of Warcraft and I'm going to go for a run even if I don't feel like it I'm going to study for my exams even if I don't feel like it ignore my emotional state which wants me to descend play World of Warcraft and I'm going to do the thing that is better for my long-term long-term future I'm going to do the heart thing that I know I should do it makes sense. it's not exactly not saving it but I think he'd given that I'm brooding always man I think I probably swing too far in the opposite direction and I have a lot of friends who is traditionally High Achievers who are also in this boat whereby we will often do that whether or not we feel like it because we know it's there a good thing to do but just so take that to the point of extremism almost where even if I've had like yeah I'm I'm in a bit of a slump in my emotional state is a bit like a feeling inspired to ride from already feeling inspired to make a video you have to be a professional and actually would a video coming out later this week or next week about overcoming procrastination that is all about like tackling the thing of the resistance but we have by thing a big part of at least for me this going to call about ignoring my emotional state and pushing through and doing stuff like even even though I wasn't feel it feeling like it something on the lines that yes there was some occasions in which we do have to force ourselves to do stuff but it's okay to take a break is a very roundabout way of saying it's okay even if there's a sponsor video deadline coming up I could just email sponsored be like hey guys already feeling it wasn't inspired can we delay this video by few days and then basically it so it's okay to take a break I have to be productive at all at all times regardless of how I was feeling and I think contributed to this weird relationship that I have a productivity that my calendar was way too busy a few app that lets you like a send a link to someone if they can book A Time on your calendar and so anytime people would email me like the. Of a few weeks where I was very trigger happy with my calendar link I would it be like if someone would be like hey can I pick your brain about XIV like whatever you want something and maybe you can help ensure the book A Time on the calendar like a ridiculously packed calendar we're like every half an hour from like 9:30 in the morning until like 6 p.m. some days I would just have a different Zoom called amongst live sessions of my pot on YouTuber Academy which has been running for the last 6 weeks it would be alongside coaching session their workouts and lessons and it was so many days where I was like having lunch on a zoom call being like looking examples of those 5 hours I'm going to stay in back-to-back them close to the next like that was like why the hell don't you take a break to eat dinner like what's the point of you being on a zoom code is that our really going to make a difference but because I Spencer trigger happy with my calendar think I felt bad in canceling these people had a ridiculously packed calendar quiet a henna creative arts do need a lot of time blocked out to actually make a video and actually write something because in my head I was thinking well I'm a professional employers and so I can set the camera up like an amazing person in my life I can fold in half an hour I just didn't take account of the fact that I am a waste by sometime so it comes to this stuff and it takes me 3 hours to get into the mood to then film I just didn't really come that I should have assumed that I was better at this productivity thing that I actually was and that man that I overlooked my calendar so they built into my my schedule margin beings are gaps apps where you can just sit down and think or something runs over over and then you can you can fit in the gap or if you want have lunch with me yet I haven't got to that until all these different things I think what what contributed to this overrule you know like I see Dai call me mother to do any of this stuff, both with a buck is too much effort the goal is to Hans never going to happen figured out what the problem is where I'm now sit at the activity started to address this problem so fussy I have made it a point to not set outfit goals outcome goals rather and so even though in the back of my mind I do really want this book to be a New York Times bestseller that's anytime I I thought I try and Squishy away and think instead know if I had to choose between that and I'm proud of him that I like I would definitely choose writing a book that I'm proud of and that I like and even full videos like like this on YouTube like I've been doing more of these down and have a chat with a couple teapot videos videos because I can just speak from the heart I can talk about my feelings and feels like the camera is in a therapist very well produced here 2018 ways to be productive at I bet it would take a lot of effort to put together in a load of like mental effort to bring myself to sit down and make which is why party I've been doing more of these videos if people want to watch them to watch them if they don't they don't people will find something to do with that time regardless I don't need to be fixated on what that number is telling me on YouTube Studio on the YouTube analytics secondly I now have a much MTA calendar which is great I have modified my calendar links and Have Nots my sister Elizabeth Elizabeth keep telling me like why the hell are you saying yes to so many people because I feel like I'm a I'm a chronic nice guy in that if somebody mails me or message me or especially if like a friend introduced me to someone else who died when they ask for meeting to say yes to it and it was this thing of saying yes to too many things on booking them in the condo way too often. Metha condos overloaded so that'll change my calendar thing so like no one is allowed to book meetings with me before 2 in the afternoon give me the whole morning basically free to do crazy stuff and then allow for lunch and then I can have Kohl's from like 2 till like 6 p.m. but I'm only allowed to have like two or three cool to each day and so it's like a system solution to a people problem with my people problem I'm too Keen to say yes to things but now the link doesn't the link itself does not let him be overbooked myself it's too many things it's weird cuz like when you start off doing stuff on the internet you think like anytime you got to come anytime you get an email you're like oh my God someone I'll give you like an hour of my time but then as you become more then you start getting way too much inbound under literal literally not enough hours in the day to actually be able to say yes to all the things you want to say yes to any and and even if there were it wouldn't make sense to use up kind of 18 hours of my working day to just have meetings with people do the reason people follow me in the first place is because I make the time to make videos like mt blocks of time in my calendar I don't think I would be serving my long-term interest or over a long-term Whitfield background that's a bit more aware of what my emotional state is at any given moment because even though they don't have mental health issues it still helpful to be able to speak to someone that just encourages you in anyway forces you to actually address what your emotional state is around stuff and so I'm trying to get more okay with ask myself how do I feel right now and you know therefore do I you want to do the thing that I know I should do or should I just going to give in to my feelings but not doing that other bad things so still working progress I was already feeling like feeling this video right now but my house is doing it and I'm coming because activation energies just getting started to get started twitch.tv / the thing that I realized I really should get better at doing is that at the end of the day I can just choose to be satisfied with what I've done next video if you have a family or like out them I wasn't present enough with my kids and my housemate and all that crap and then at the end of the day you go to bed thinking oh my God I'm going to bed too late and I'm going to get enough sleep and then the whole cycle is going to continue choosing to be satisfied with so I can do is the day I could just think to myself you know what today's been a good day at work I could think that or I could be myself I could think of my God either way it doesn't change the fact that I've done video I show a thumbnail I did a thing for my YouTuber Academy in the story I tell myself about it after the fact does not change the actual reality all it does is make me feel bad about myself when I tell myself on the waste man and it's it's 10 p.m. but haven't done enough work for the day therefore I should be doing something productive play World of Warcraft or something so I'm trying to do is trying to tell myself that it's okay to choose to be satisfied with what I've done at the end of the day because ultimately it doesn't really change anything or it does is make me feel better about my life and then I can play World of Warcraft while streaming on Android gilfry rather than hating myself every step of the way as I level up my protection Paladin and soda is my toxic relationship with productivity and still a work-in-progress it's been awhile since I've been in a relationship with anyone or anything so it's kind of a kind of noble anyway but it's not relationship that I would like and I'm in a she and I are working together to improve things to this point in the video I'd love for you to leave a clover Emoji in the comments on what was very curious to see how many people reached the end of the video if you don't subscribe to telling you if you enjoyed this Adele playlist over here with more chitchat rumbly videos ever kept a friend that's a bad thing thanks.

            "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFN1uO1g3ls",
            "text": " so I recently decided that I wanted to learn how to freestyle rap it's not something I've ever thought of doing before as a doctor and productivity I always wanted to be the next Ed Sheeran from the next 50 Cent Jay-Z or Logic Pro videos by Christina and Harry Mack and I realized that freestyle rap is the coolest thing ever if you can do it properly but since day one and I'm just about to have my very first coaching session with my friend Michael I'm no idea I was going to go let's just see what happens Michael is one of the founders of ultra speaking and he's been doing freestyle rap for the 80s lower than it's ever been I'm not a veteran quite clear that I had a lot to learn to say hello you got to reach into the zone you going to hit that flow you go to spit those balls like you Spitting Fire I don't know what even rhymes with fire what Post-it notes going to take my notes about the freestyle rap that I'm going to go I'm going to make a video on YouTube doing during the first week I tried to practice the 10 minutes each day in the shower but I constantly feel super self-conscious even though the only you can hear me with my housemate and took the first week was really hot and I went back to Michael a little bit frustrated and wondering how I could improve Whitfield the eventual is a component of this that you're not going to be able to shortcut in 30 days because of just the true experience you got from reps from rhyming the same words over and over again rhyme work simply by taking the word and really dissecting an adjust the Roof sounds so what are the route sounds of Pepsi to flood our brain with rhyme potentially forcing it to make the sounds on the spot and whether or not if it's a real word or it makes sense you literally run through that program so let's let's practice fortnite but I'm on a boat right cuz I'm cuz I'm playing fortnite and its ports fights and its consciousness right sode 12 of The Journey and I can feel like things are kind of becoming easier but I know that I still got tons and tons of practice today if you want to actually get it tomorrow which of the party like this training Community types and where they help you get into flow when it comes to rocking so why I'm doing this freestyle rap thing and the main part of the reason is just because I think it's cool like I'm generally a fan of love . and even if what I'm doing doesn't actually have any real long-term benefit like I'm never going to become a freestyle rap for I'm never going to make money off of it it doesn't matter because I think it's cool and it's fun and that's the mental model that I use to decide whether I'm going to do something Justice like it would be fun does it seem like it would be an interesting journey to go up so that's the most important part but freestyle rap is actually useful in other ways as well a study published in 2012 found that when people perform freestyle rap then brain activity increases in the area is responsible for motivation action language emotion and motor skills while we get reduced activity in the brain region responsible for regulating supervision and monitoring which No Limits are spontaneous creativity freestyle rap it forces our brains to try and find these unique words and Rhymes and combinations and not kind of forces us to be more creative with a language and when we started interacting in the stars are aligned freestyle rappers get into the Flow State and that way trying to work on with Gavin began by explaining what he thinks is key to the freestyle rap process which is something he cools the flow cycle srfr the first principle is called slow is just around the corner just put one step in front of the other if you stumble it's okay because that's actually the first part of the flow cycle which is the S which is struggle a challenge should actually be a little harder but basically little harder than your skill challenge to give dirt a little effort into it and then basically Becomes of positive feedback loop where you start to get the hang of it and that triggers the second phase which is our release for your parasympathetic nervous system is engaged your heart rate slows down and you relax and when you relax you start to judge yourself less when you get inside that place it triggers the next sandwiches Flow State they call it a transient hypofrontality right so this is where the parts of your prefrontal cortex that's response decision making planning ahead planning your 2021 goals that actually shuts off and that's a really important part of your brain and it's also the mechanism for the inner critic comes it's like always think or what if I fail what if I don't do good at this and it keeps us head that's going to be the goal is for you to access flowstate today using me Motive Power music weekend again doing some sketching exercises to help unlock Flow by the aim isn't to make any sense at all but just to lean into the discomfort and get over that inner feeling of cringey self-consciousness and just basically make random noises over the beat doing these exercises actually help me lean into that discomfort a bit more and help me find that flow for more quickly as we move towards the halfway point of the challenge play about halfway through your journey now what's working what isn't supposed to starting to realize that no more than words and phrases that I can lean on if I need to Lycoming like driving with my homies and chilling downtown most rappers use games solitary macule always see everything age and whether she thought I had a potential career as a world famous rapper it makes me cringe for him enough to make him stop have the street cred by things to do it forever I could and my desk on the sofa in the kitchen in my Tesla in the shower on the podcast with my brother I managed to sneak in a few sessions with Michael and then after the wild things start to feel a little bit like they were clicking and I was finding a little bit easier to get into that flowstate so before we get into the final day I want to share a few lessons that I've learned over the last 30 days of trying to do this freestyle rap lesson number one in the most important is always stay in the zone like always stay in character keep the flow going and this is really hot if you're trying to do a little bit of freestyle rap and then you like aw crap I can't think of anything to say and then you just have to kind of just keep it because that's called the game in like the more you keep on going to move the stuff starts going down and like trying to train ourselves out of monitoring the things that were thinking and cringing at them and then Bangla oh my God I'm getting embarrassed so I'm going to stop and for the first few days where I was doing this really really struggled to break through this like I know what I'm saying doesn't make sense I know this is absolutely terrible but I've just got to keep on going anyway because that's how it works secondly I've done that a brain has a surprisingly good autocomplete function on that I opened when I was doing the freestyle rap in the shower or in my car and I leaned into that thing of embracing the discomfort of being absolutely terrible at it and embracing the Society of just keep going I found that occasionally I was coming up with some pretty good stuff and I would just kind of sentences that my brain would randomly finish off with something that sounded kind of cool and sounded like it was rhyming with a thing with him previously kind of monitor what I'm saying and especially if it's like a social situation in which I'm not particularly comfortable like I've always kind of like running this thing in my head of like oh I don't want to say anything that might be misconstrued as being like I would like creepy or like Ranger like offense Ava like you know what if they think I'm an idiot because I say this thing has constant like thing running through my head but what I found is that like if I just take a step back and don't think about it too then then things just work out like when I'm with my friends when I'm with my house by 21 when I'm with people I'm comfortable around I'm not worried about what I'm saying through letting freestyle rap I realized that I need to try and get into this state more often where I'm just going to have him non-judgemental approach and trusting my brains autocomplete function to say something reasonable whether or not it's called the right thing is that you have to break through the cringe response I'm pretty good at being okay with this like you're making a video like this be like oh my God stop doing freestyle rap stick to making freaking videos on YouTube that's why it takes a certain level of like to be able to get through that crowd response you know that the Judgment from others I II II this thing I just have to keep on going I think this is a transferable skill to other aspects of life like if you can get over the fear of being cringy it is unlocks a very interesting aspect of The Human Experience where you owe more okay with taking risks and doing stuff that feels do you that might have with others and embracing your personal witness because really it's the personal witness and the authenticity that helps us connect with other people before freestyle rap and absolutely be learned zero idea like it seems like such a black box how do I go from here like zero experience with wrapping last year experience how do I get any white clothes to wear these guys are still over State knowing you're nowhere near that point but bye little bit of time working on it I feel like I've cracked the black box and now it's light okay I see the road to get to where they are I see the practice of taking I see the message along the way and it's not like such an unknown kind of thing until what I'd encourage you to do is if you're thinking of letting some and you it feels like a black books you don't be afraid of the Black Books is crack it open and you'll find them there are probably some very well child and pubs hiding within the books Michael and Tristan from Ultra speaker during a YouTube livestream we're playing a game called a blind slideshow where random images come up and we have to try and wrap about those as prompt it was one of my attempts from the session good memory that's one of the things I can't even see I'm in the money store and I'm wearing my mouth can I don't know why it's real talk in the sunlight with my black car and my Mazda my mom and she's in the driver seat and I'm in the car and the windows are down in the blowing of my errands now my be what you doing a while to see the wind in your face going down home downtown and my memory that's why I'm supposed to be talking about but I just don't know what I'm eating. I just know that I've got to stay in the flow I feel like a lot of times my memory sitting on my desk with my lights in my face and the camera and microphone and I just go on and on and I speak to the camera I do these like screams and I look outside and I noticed the clouds in the sky are in the windows they just go by but really I'm just sitting here in front of the PC it's not a PC if my master and you know that I don't believe in Windows because outside there's a window in the background with my orange bag and I've got my childhood memory and I've Got my swag and it says on it it said Apple this is a freestyle rap so that was my 30 days of trying to learn how to freestyle rap obviously still not very good but it's a work-in-progress if you guys are interested in lifelong learning the way I am you might like to check out skillshare sponsoring this video I've got a ton of online classes on skillshare to themed around productivity to around how to study for exam one about the lessons that I've taken from stoicism to make myself happier and one on how to video edit using Final Cut Pro if you want to create videos exactly like this if you're one of the first thousand people to hit the link in the description that you will get a free trial to skillshare and during that for all you can check out one of my classes along with the thousands of other online classes that big Goldenseal share and those range from oil filter topics from like graphic design and illustration to business and Pro cooking an interior design and basically anything you want to learn you can let us go share.

            "text": " okay so here's the problem that I've recently sold with these five magical apps like you I read a lot of books eyebrows lot of articles on the internet I listen to a podcast and I'm always going through twice I want to know the toilet and across these dozens of hours of content consumption everyday I will occasionally come across some highlights or interesting bets the resonate with me or things that are surprisingly things like insights that I want to capture for later but until very recently I didn't have a way of locking these insights and so I would spend all this time over the Earth like my life listening and reading and browsing and watching all of this stuff and only really taking away a fraction of it and remembering even less of it and applying even less of it to my life which kind of question that why was it wasting all this time consuming all this stuff if I wasn't going to apps that work together seamlessly to form what electrical the magical inside logging framework and automatic method for capturing and Logan inside that we get from Brooks articles podcast even tweets stop with the first free apps that make up the consumption layer with the first part of the medical inside looking the First on this list and the least interesting is Kendall so if you're reading books on Kindle which I've been doing since like 2008 on the Kindle first came out I think as you reading stuff you can highlight stuff Celtic Festival app on the Kindle app across any of your devices like instapaper and the other is that anytime I come across there and then then I will share it to instapaper and is also the ways of sharing it you can use the iOS share extension you can instapaper you can use a promo Safari extension there a hundred ways of getting stuff into instapaper and actually this is one of my biggest productivity hacks in general it stops I will always come across interesting emails with interesting articles almost never read them there and then I'll always save them to enter paper so. Then when I'm next in the mood to read stuff I open up the instapaper app on my iPhone or iPad on the web and then go apps for Android and stuff as well that I can start reading through one by one Full House I like the really cool thing about instapaper and pocket is that while you're reading these articles on whatever device you want you can highlight them and that is how we are going to be interesting or inside out inside out in Fremont say I can in for some reason that passage like really resonates with me I think all this is an incredible adding to this highlight so I can take notes on the highlights and reading as I'm going through them and number three is a magical app that is unfortunately unavailable for IOS and Android version and this is now how I and this is a truly magical app called air. IO doesn't share the best moments from podcast let me show you what this looks like so Eric and I can go in there and I can go through what costs. I want to listen to so it's a pretty standard podcast player so far but the truly magical thing about Aaron Watson on my favorite podcast app is why you listening to a podcast you can hit this big quote in the middle and that lets you take an air quote if you hear something that's particularly insightful you hit the air and it will automatically create an airport from the last 30 seconds to 50 seconds of the stuff that you listen to you and you can change that amount of time set volume listen to this episode of the portal with Eric Weinstein and Ryan holiday still want to play the same games they won't let us tell her stories and you like it Ryan holiday comment about meaning in Life or something like that and now it's saved as an escort and was really cool is that are automatically generates transcript for the most popular podcast answer when you create an effort is the transcription is available it will basically just create a highlight for you and this is completely game-changing because it was not possible to take notes from podcast episode what I was listening to it over the weekend I took 1 2 3 4 677 head quotes from it because those with a bits that particularly resonates with me those three apps that make up the consumption therapy about the integration there and this is a very special app that I've been loving for the last like 2 years since I first discovered and there is a special link in the description of use my code you will get an extended free trial for 60 days rotten 30 days if you want to find out and so it won't read was is amongst other things it is the integration there for my system so what it's doing its bringing together all of the High Life that I've created from the three consumption apps and so if I sign into my replies but we'll see is that it brings together books articles tweets and put cost so it when it comes to books it automatically connect to my Amazon account cuz I've given it until a goatee 207 books I've been highlighting on Kindle the last several years and what is doing is that is bringing together all of my highlights from these books all into one place but it's not just books it's also automatically connecting to instapaper and so any article that I've highlighted lights all the way back from 2019 when I first started using it to pay for it basically takes all of the highlights and put them all in one place this is another clever than buffer and these were seven of the passages to the highlights from that particularly resonates with me well decided to tweet and podcast functionality Soffer tweets for example if I come across a tweet and browsing and I find that it sticky resonates with me all I have to do is send that tweets to the Reed wise Twitter account and it will automatically save the Tweet thread bringing oil and Pollock Morris needed support so it automatically connects to air because I've linked up my hair dye account and now all of the airports on capturing from podcasts are automatically being synced into read wise so here are some highlights you definitely said of the temperature and because are had a transcript available for all of the clothes that I bought from this episode on now only one place in Reed was Gucci Mane benefits of the traditional read what service and what I've been working on my channel for the last two years since I first discovered it is that if you want everyday read wise can send you an email that has five of your highlights that's randomly surface but very real I did another feature and that makes this absolutely game-changing and possibly medical inside and not Patriots that Reed was Canelo automatically export all of it highlights to notion which is the acronym using my second right what is the app that I use for my second brain it's my central external note taking system that basically organizes my entire life but they don't have any creative control over what's being said and it's one of those things where when using ocean for such a long time since like I loved every March 2019 and it is a perfect Stroke of Luck. They also wants wants my videos because I don't tell anyone I would make these videos anyway organize my life studying for my exam so when preparing for the u.s. look into my team and just do so many things on the best bet is notion is now completely free of charge you only pay for notion if you working with a team so if your individual if you're a student you can use notion for free or however long you want for whatever you want it's absolutely fantastic video Until the best thing ever is that read wise now automatically export engine ocean until what that means that when you link your notion account to read wise what it does is that it creates this special read wise page which just brings together all of the highlights for the insights that you've gathered from books articles podcast and tweets and this is really freaking cool right to Oregon pool this is library for everything but if I want to look at books are all the books that I've read that I've highlighted and I can go into one of them let's go tribe and I can automatically see every single one of the highlights of golden hair and if I click on one of these locations it will open up the Kindle app to that location where made the Highlight if I want to find the context behind what I was thinking of time with me at the time which was in November 2019 ocean at my second brain it's now here all in one place and I could do that with a recent podcast I listen to that I've highlighted for gobble Hugh Jackman one is go over the highlights for me in the ocean with nice cover art and and stuff so just looks pretty and even those that we because I got a cup of coffee of 39 things I was like I'll save it but then it was it's been sitting in my Twitter bookmarks. Ages but now I've got a notion all in one place so it doesn't have any magical inside logging framework if you also have this problem where you can consuming too much stuff book and you don't have like a system for money inside from the idea and actually applying them to your own life and remembering them and I'd rather recommend you setup your own magical inside logging framework you don't have to use all these apps Kindle I would have wanted person recommend everyone instapaper vs. pocket are is the only weddings with podcast at the moment we was fantastic and for your second brain read was also outputs to notion room and Evernote so you're not tied into anyone after this other thing but as I said the one that I use my second brain is notion I love it and I remember that back in the day like 2 years ago anytime people would recognize me on the streets or something but in the lost like 18 months or so no one person is said to me about an iPad because your recommendation instead now the thing that people say to me when they meet me in real life as I started using notion because of you and it's changed my life so thank you so if you want to find out more about how I use notion to my life and supercharge my productivity over here that'll be some of my videos about how I use notion that behind the scenes of my magical systems at thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " this video is Conde sponsored by Dashlane keep your Digital Life secure and never forget a password ever again today I'm going to be doing a review of the Apple Watch series 4 for the last six months as usual will start with the overall conclusion and whether it's worth it so that's what you're here for a bit more detail about the five main use cases that I personally use the much for discussion about whether those are really worth the 400-pound hundred dollar price. So in conclusion I absolutely love my Apple watch I use it every single day and it adds a small amount of convenience to my life in the form of notifications Apple pay music and control Google Maps two-factor Authentication more importantly I think it looks really pretty as an accessory and it goes with every outfit that I wear and in a way it lets me signal to people that I'm a cool guy who's into Tech and all that sort of stuff is all of this really worth of 400 lb of $400 price tag complicated in my opinion I think it is worth it I do not regret the money I spent on this I'm glad I spent the money on it but it's a bit more complicated than that and whether it's worth it will depend on your personal circumstances a lot and I'll discuss that more at the end of the video forward ahead so that was the overall conclusion if that's what you're here for then that's fantastic to please drop a like on this video and then do something better with your life but for the rest of the video series bull okay I don't normally comment on specs because since like 2015 specs for things like phones and iPads and stuff haven't really made any difference to anyone's life but for the Apple watch that's not the case I used to have the Apple watch 3 and it was really really really play Slow to the point where it was quicker to without my phone for my skinny jeans front squeeze out look at my phone and do whatever I need to do that's not the case of the series for this thing is lightning-fast I have never once noticed it being slow and also the screen bezels are thinner than they used to be it feels like an edge-to-edge display an order this is the 44 1/2 size feels similar to the old one but there is a lot more screen real estate so good and speed is good and that's what I'm going to say about the back so I don't like talking about sex life changing in any way at all that just very small convenience is to add a small amount of convenience the five main things first one is notifications so I'm not getting some notifications on the Apple watch notifications because then I can decide if it's something I need to bust out my phone or iPad for and then I can reply to the email or I can just archived it directly from the Apple watch I spend less time checking my phone and less time triaging email on my phone I was not getting Instagram DM notifications because I'm old computer and stuff at least I like to think so I get a few tens of Instagram DM's each day where it's like someone has requested to send you an Instagram message kind of nice like you know I'm in the middle of what I have and I could watch him cuz I also don't want to talk to me release that makes me feel happy throughout the day Apple pay using Apple pay on the Apple watch it's like the reason I don't even carry a wallet around with me anymore UK cuz the vast majority of shops now except contact list so I can just double tap on the Apple watch scroll through my Visa or my American Express on my monzo card depending on how I'm feeling the Barista behind the counter was someone in it's really annoying when it doesn't work do the whole face ID make face ID work so then you can actually pay with your American Express, do whatever I don't want to see the fact that it would be to get your phone and use Apple pay on that it saves you about to and each time a big deal but it's quite not to have to watch for that cuz I really like the fact that you can control music to play some stuff on Spotify on Spotify I want to change the song or Shuffle I can just open the Spotify app on the Apple watch and change it that way if I'm having a shower and I'm wearing my watch I usually have some kind of music playing through my waterproof Bluetooth speaker in the shower and it's about song like the maps feature sometimes if I'm having to find a new place in London or Rome around town and I've got directions on my phone I can use Apple Maps to send the directions to the Apple watch and it will give me time turn directions which means I don't have to kind of look at my phone as I'm walking around I can just kind of get the vibration of the Apple watch be like a turn right onto long road and I will turn right onto long road sadly this doesn't open Google Maps only Apple Maps but hey that's the price we pay having the convenience of the Apple watch only one thing I start doing regularly on the Apple watch is using the app Dashlane as a form of two-factor authentication so because I've got two Factor authentication enabled on all the accounts that I care about instead of when I'm looking into like a new computer having today iPhone and use authenticator instead I just open up the Dashlane app on my Apple watch and it generates the two-factor authentication codes automatically so I can just see them on the Apple watch and I can enter them in and that saves me a few seconds of my life each day where I don't have to get out my the story of Apple watch saving you a few seconds Bud way if you haven't heard of it. Slander the Fantastic password and identity manager the very kindly sponsoring this video on my MacBook my iPad my iPhone and now my Apple watch for the past several months three main reasons why firstly it makes me more efficient when I'm on the computer because every time it recognizes that you're looking into something it just instantly feels in your login details to the point where you sometimes don't even see the login screen you just automatically which is awesome secondly it's dorzolamide thousands of password security which is very nice and again generate new ones for new websites that I register with and finally it still has all of my credit and debit card details security so if ever want to buy something on the iPhone or the iPad on the MacBook or whatever I can just water filter credit card details which means again I don't have to carry around excitingly Dashlane has over 10 million users in 150 countries if you fancy giving it a try you can do to dashlane.com adult that's ABD wal so how do we decide if something is objectively worth money you spend on it if you see my previous tech reviews you'll know I've got a three-point framework number one doesn't make me any happier number to does it remove any Salient negatives from my life and number 3 does it allow me to do or make any asthma body to my life on all three counts so as far as you know this attempt at creating an objective measure of whether something is worth it goes the Apple watch is not worth it in fact I would argue that it will never be worth it to spend for pounds on a watch let alone the thousands of pounds that some people spend on ready fancy watches but do I regret buying it and the answer to that is no I don't regret buying yet I'm quite glad I have this and personally even though it's objectively not worth the money I think subjectively provided you can comfortably afford it if I were in my student days or in my secondary school days are we're having to chew toys for under 20 pounds an hour in order to save up the 300 400 pounds I need it for this watch I wouldn't get it cuz far better use of my money Idina much rather buy a new digital camera buy a Kindle and like a ton of nonfiction books were meant for it they're going to add value to My Life by subscription to audible unit to read audiobooks but if you're in the position where you're financially pretty stable in spending 3 400 pounds in a watch is not you know outside the Realms of possibility and if you can sort of imagine yourself spending 400 pounds on a standard mean analog watch and being recent okay with that smoking break the bank open change your life then by all means go for the Apple watch if you're into tank if you're into this. It does look quite nice and it does as a signal to people that you are a tech person because give me the whole point of accessory do things like this is you know this element of signaling you are showing people that I'm the sort of person that has an Apple watch it at 4 I want you to make these assumptions about me and even though you know it sounds weird to say out loud and even though we should that way I think that is a strong component us about why people spend money on luxury products like the Apple watch it lets us signal so yeah if you can comfortably afford it then I don't think you'll be disappointed with this please do not buy the Apple watch it's absolutely not worth you saving your hard-earned cash for this buy a camera instead I guarantee it'll at 100 tunnel Mill Valley Trail so that was a review of the Apple Watch series 4 in conclusion I quite like a it's a luxury product definitely the ad very tiny amount of convenience to my life but because I can okay when you talk about money and we should all be more kind about talking about money because you know by the grace of God I can comfortably afford to spend 400 positive watch and think nothing of it I think it's worth it if you know in that position is not going to be worth it thanks for watching I hope you like my video a thumbs up if you have and I will see you in the next video"

            "text": " aprons welcome back to the channel entity monthly favorite series is making a comeback in these troubled times today we're going to be talking about blog post a podcast physical product on a book series so let's just jump into it is this blog post from collaborative fun.com code how to read lots of inputs and a strong filter by Morgan housel start as many books as I can but finish few of them years ago I heard Charlie Munger say and most books I don't read the first chapter I'm not burdened by bad books I stuck with me reading is a chore if you insist on finishing every book you again because the majority of books are there what is summarizing Introduction note for you will see anyone running your way to the last page of these books that have it likely formed in school can turn reading into the equivalent of a 10 hour work meeting with nothing gets done and everyone is bored and want to see reading through that lens things to pick up an audiobook Wings which is of course tragic the man who doesn't read good books has no advantage of the man who can't read them said Mark Twain every smart person I know is voracious reader who also says every spot person I know is voracious reader who led the founding College tuition at $25,000 a year comes out to roughly $100 collection good books sometimes written by the same Professor can be purchased with 15 bucks and can offer multiple times as much life changing inside before we continue I think it's pretty important I made a video a few months ago I think cold how to read more books 8 tips or reading or something of that where I basically said this thing that we should move away from this idea that a book is like a sacred thing that we have and then finish I said that I understand many people so many friends send me friend of mine who you know it started reading sapiens and I still like 20% through it and feel like that they can't physically read another book until they finish sapiens because for some reason massive undertaking that I have to read the whole bucket is a complete nut and this article really corroborated this feeling of her fears which is that you know reading a whole book is kind of pointless especially if it's a nonfiction book specially if you've gotten us the idea is already from summary or from login from the table of contents when it comes to non-fiction books really busy usually kind of a handful if not let if no fewer key inside the older ones to get across but in order to turn into a bug they have to flush it out for like a few tens of thousands of words with more like examples of things and once they reach that book then they can start doing speaking gigs and you know getting paid $50,000 to speak at a conference in writing a book from speaking Townsend from the non-fiction books are a lot longer than fiction book and you don't like it or you put the main idea of the book it's a real shame to think that you have been I need to be read to the end but some books can change your life means you need two things to get a lot of reading you need lots of inputs and a strong filter if you only pick up books don't know with certainty you're going to like yourself to reading the same with those on the same topics oxygen to confirmation bias unlimit your ability to connect the dots between different field in different cultures it's better to have a low bar and what books you willing to try and even the faintest tickle of Interest should be enough to make a cut candle samples of free so excuses a mineral we should be getting that lives in doesn't husband puts but then he goes on to say once you flooded your desk with inputs comes the filter it should be ruthless taking no prisoners and offering no mercy similar to dating a book you're not into after 10 minutes of attention little chance of a happy ending slam it shut and move on if you quit the book off the three pages anymore then if you reject the proposition of a 10-hour date with someone who you just met who annoys you love deficiency search conversation and learning without flooding your brain with inputs you'll be stuck in the teeny tiny world what you've personally experienced but without a strong feeling that you'll be overwhelmed with choice and Paralyzed by inaction a good reading filters more Art and Science will have to find one that works to you the point is that the highest odds of finding the right piece of information comes from in updating yourself with information the very quickly being able to say. Ain't it perhaps to some element of confirmation bias there where he is saying what I believe to be true anyway and therefore agreeing with it makes me feel intelligent Casino someone has read an article on the internet with neighbor but I think there is death married to the theory that you need to have lots of inputs and a strong filter and so everything's coming across this. Really solidified this in my mind and so now when I read I've try and kind of get looked into it but I haven't even more ruthless a filter for not continuing past things I do enjoy what resonate with me then I previously did so I will put link to the blood pressure to check out and save to Evernote or notional wherever you save your articles of things and I will be setting to be reading your articles on collaborative fund. Comment maybe you can check them out and Instagram DM email.com and it's called emotions output link to That Dunta Dun deverry description you should definitely check it out I never heard an episode of invisibilia before apparently they examine like the invisible invisible things we take for granted I'm going to go deep into them but this episode about emotions ready ready ready hit me hard because it first lie is like amazing Art of Storytelling like it tells the story of a lorry driver who crashed his like who killed a family by then crushing his that current is Lori I told about oldie different emotions that the parents are experiencing of the Lorry driver is experiencing and then it talks about an interview the next brothers write a book about this other stuff about origin of emotions and where emotions come from and sort of telling the theory on its head that we we sort of think that emotions are formed as a reaction to events like if we experience trauma then we will have a certain kind of emotion associated with but what they talked about in this podcast and with this interview from the sex biting her name is Lisa thing, but they talked about how actually this potentially only four main emotions of internal feelings that we can experience and that is I think it's something like unpleasant attention and inattention northing IR like arousal and attention of every emotion we experience as a result of these for Intel Sensation that is just a story that were telling ourselves through socializing through Thai tea and they make the point that in societies where we don't have specific words for specific emotions people don't feel those emotions and that's likely to be mine dying because you would think something like fear or love or anger these would be Universal emotions but with you guys are arguing is that actually it might not be that Universal maybe just a story that we tell ourselves that when someone shuts the door in your face then that slightly unpleasant feeling that you experienced what you owe your body knows it's just you interpret that as being angry when you have the second response to it so that was very interesting but like I already called her just at the whole podcast episode is an absolute like Marvel it is so well done is really really honey produced by NPR voice actor is really pretty good description you check it out invisibilia emotions episode and that was a 50 medical student who was impatient with me a few weeks ago, Marius from Android and anytime I see someone I like to ask what's up I want to discover this time play I've been combining this unit Bellaire with my Nordstrom 1970 notebook with this is great I am still running the same one and every day I like to do different things of that at some pretty with I filled up to the next video coming up soon or it's not already told me about how I use this as a sort of analog to do list type thing anyway I've combined that unit Bellaire with my daughter 1917 and now this is now my favorite way to write the nice thing is that reading makes you makes you writing the light over the surface of the page I just saw you know anything about it is that if you're not careful you handwriting can get quite messy so I think it's it's good for me because they help me look right lost which means in a way even though writing is still like 10 times slower than typing it's less slow with this pain. His writing with a fountain pen cuz fountain pens I bet you have what your handwriting so give me a 1% commission from Amazon if you buy this pain but sick little present for the last many many many months if not I want to start listening to this The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan Jordan is now I think dead and I think Brandon Sanderson who is my favorite punching people to revolt I'm so addicted rolling Brandon Sanderson took over writing the lost people to The Wheel of Time series so I just finished listening to book 6 and up just been listening to an old Apple notes. Who would have been convicted scription not sponsored unfortunately but you can get a free trial of audible without link anyway I've been listening to Audible like when was it I think since late 2017 I've always had a fantasy audiobook on the go on Audible if I started off with the mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson which I talked about I think in January 2018 in the first episode of this monthly favorite series then I read the kingkiller Chronicles or listen to that the Name of the Wind in the wise man's fear by Patrick rothfuss and we are all anxiously awaiting book 3 of that series called Doors of Stone walls of stone. video and then it was The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson and it took me a whole year I think to get to The Stormlight Archive I listen to it from 2018 through the midnight 2019 and that was the first three books of that again little anxiously waiting for should be coming out November this year I think and then I'll to listen to The Stormlight Archive I then jumped into the Wheel of Time and I think I was a good order to do it and because the mistborn series is a good kind of gateway drug is really long but it's also very soon high impact going to get you into this whole fantasy thing then The Stormlight Archive is really really long and there's like tons and tons of it it's a can be quite slow at times so I think having a background in fantasy and canoeing what to expect how to get through The Stormlight Archive otherwise the first half of the first book and kind of feel like what's going on I don't understand what's happening in The Wheel of Time Books in the series I've been avoiding looking at any kind of don't stop it's also for the eye of the world and I caught and brought 2 3 4 5 and 6 off of I-17 right now small in like a little bit ago something with like one character and then as the books in the series expand you unlock kind of more of the world and you get more characters coming in and the main characters get more powerful and you know the kid with his sword is getting beaten up by the Bay he gets his DNA becomes a blade mulch or stuff like that and then he becomes enough to do that's kind of the formula to be fancy books and so the premise of the suspect is that they're these three kids called Perrin and Matt are there in the in the two rivers it's a sword like the Shire in Lord of the Rings is like you know tiny but it's a little know where everyone is a subsistence lifestyle but then a woman comes until they are like the chosen ones or something and she's like a wizard and then somebody's attacked the village and they she and the three boys in like there's a few tomates they have to go in this adventure to find to get more training and defeat the dark wanted it sounds really real say it like that but everything sounds by we funny face explain it induces what but you should stop to be sexier if you have not yet started listening to audiobook then please do yourself a favor and start with mis bone then you can get it I've been do we have time and you literally have I listened to about 20 to 30 hours of audio books every month so whenever don't listen to audiobooks one or two hours a day depending on how I'm driving to work and these days exclusively when I'm driving to work and back I'm at the gym but you're not anymore because it sucks isolation and stuff social isolation social distancing but when I'm driving to and from work I just listen to what he looks even with doing that like 2 hours a day basically they just like it's still taking it Taking Me different years to get through the fantasy books to the lab to be fantastic if you haven't yet involved in the junior fantasy audiobooks you start off with in this older recommended you would literally have the next like 3 to 5 years ahead of you sorted in terms of what your entertainment on the go wherever you are nothing at the Brandon Sanderson continue to try. Nobles in the process of writing third book of the series and there's loads of other kind of fancy what ebooks I can't wait to dive into but I'm trying to stay with another girl long I made the mistake of I started listening to it and then because it goes so good I switch the Kindle and I was going to pull through it and I kind of regret doing that because because I read so fast into skin a lot it means that I miss a lot of the Savory mr. happens when I listen to audible like it will take me 10 times longer to get through it but I would enjoy it more because I'm like what were you watching a TV show the climax of the TV show Lost a few seconds at most like you kind of know what's going on and it has like a pretty amazing fight fight Dino something to find maybe that's a few minutes but with audiobooks he climaxes lost for absolutely ages I can rub it like when whenever it gets to the end to like toward the end of these books like the towards the end of The Wheel of Time series is the wisdom like big thing going on and that's like you stole my archive still get tears in my eyes when I think about the end of book one of The Stormlight Archive and like all the stuff that happens if I counted in an hour and stuff and it's just like so so so epic remember and when I go to that I just arrived home from the gym here on the sofa like 4 hours until like 3 in the morning just like listening to this clear just like so sick anyway. They're ready the one miss ball and then kingkiller Chronicles Mike Morse I'll be continuing to recommend loading fantasy audiobooks on this epic alarm set definition of people use my link the Navy of Amazon at Rockingham Nissan of the game through my link maybe they'll be like hey I love you and that will be the potential benefit of watching a moper playlist care of more monthly favorites if you haven't seen me to check them out there quite like Evergreen I don't tend to review things that I like all this month I'm talking about this thing that's only relevant for this month they have to be perennial recommendation so if you start from 2018 just going to go to the series of monthly favorites you will find interesting books and articles and podcast that I recommended over the years that's watching and I'll see you then"

            "text": " hey friend welcome back to the channel in this video I'm going to be reviewing these brand new 2020 iPad Pro I have here the 11th and 12th the videos can be split up into three parts I'll stop by giving you the upfront conclusion in a nutshell what I think about the iPad Pro second label talk about what's the new the 3/4 new features that are in the iPad Pro discussion about who should buy the iPad Pro 2020 2018 will like talk about a few different use cases and whether or not I would recommend the iPad Pro folders used obviously these are the best iPad ever made the iPad Pro is hands-down the best tablet on the market but if there's just one word that I can use to describe just like you know the iPad Pro in general even from the 2018 version but Atwood is overkill there is way too much power he has way too many features that the vast majority of people on the planet won't use and I personally think there's almost no justification for actually buying an iPad Pro unless either you're genuine Pro user and you have Pro needs like I don't have protein I don't know a single person in real life who has pronate I guess if you're a music producer when you exclusively produce beats on your iPad Pro then it makes sense that you know you need every ounce of how you can get so that's one category of person that I've never met in real life cancel the person is the person who just wants the best of everything and if you go in a spare cash to burn then you know the iPad Pros up to the amazing and that was the reason why in 2018 already didn't need it I could have easily gone by with you but you know I love you but even then even consider it snowed two-years-old sympathy iPad Pro 2018 was released and in a way I really don't need these new ones in fact for the very first time ever I'm going to be both of these models because my own 2018 iPad Pro model is still Overkill enough I could have easily gone by when I pet are but yeah is are the 2020 iPad pros and then we'll talk about who this product is full and I'll give some some more like opinionated recommendation what are the new features does basically three of them the first one is processor speed the processor has been upgraded slightly not as much of an upgrade at the processing usually are they replace the X on the processor it's not the 812 Zedd rather than the age of X basically like to speed if it improves the kind of responsiveness of the feel of the product for us and my 2018 iPad Pro I have never once thought this is too slow I also have a 2017 iPad Pro that I recently donated to my cousin he was check testing out the differences between the two 17 Pro in the 2018 Pro and he said he can tell the difference of processes speed discussion is kind of pointless yes if we want to the last time your iPad felt slow that's most different about this year's version compared lost his version we have a square shaped camera bump on the back button on the back of the iPhone 11 what do we got sir the iPads in general come with a 12 megapixel camera just fine but like you know the only thing I ever use the camera on the iPhone 4S for scanning documents if I feel like it even then usually attended as default to my iPhone like left on the wheel details kind of document with an iPhone with an iPad but now they've added a 10-megapixel ultra-wide which is similar to the one that you can on the iPhone 11 which is fine like if you want to take an older white photo with your iPad or your meeting different that's why I feel like I actually don't care about the camera the iPad toll because I cannot remember the last time I use the camera my iPad Pro even though I use this iPad Pro 4 hours and hours every single day and take it to work with me and take Everywhere I Go we also have interesting day was cool daylight or camera which stands for something I can't remember will put it up on the screen and basically it's a camera that can detect 3D Space by using light wavelength and stuff and what it does it is play Help the iPad fence depth a little bit more better so if we're doing augmented reality type things then it's going to improve the performance on that slightly and a lot of other tech reviews are saying that this is lidar Introduction of the 2020 iPad Pro it feels like a feature designed for the future not a feature designed for the present and so it's kind of pointless to have those with the changes to the camera and the final feature is that the microphone has been improved slightly apparently it's now a studio quality microphone so it from this one the 11-inch model of the 2020 iPad Pro and the iPad Pro that you're hearing for my $500 microphone setup with rode ntg4 Plus maybe it's kind of useful but again I suppose if you making calls with your iPad in conference calls and stuff working from home but have you doing Bennett maybe make sense to have to have but to be honest anytime I've done video calling on my life always use my airpods and airpods have built-in microphone into them so who needs a studio quality microphone in my path I guess it's kind of nice to have but hey it's not a make-or-break feature so there's a basic compared to the 2018 model we've got improve processor we've got an extra ultra-wide lens on a lidar camera and we have the studio quality microphone so I have connected trackpad to the iPad round round object into the icon gets bigger or for example that they wear on the dock it changes from a cursor into the things of it it sort of feels like a dick way of doing of doing Costa support only on the iPad this is going to become a more interesting I think in May when the magic keyboard attachment for the iPad Pro so maybe people use trackpad feature more often but again for me like I take my pet around this crackpot support is now available on iOS 13.4 up like the latest version of iPad OS it's not explicitly 2020 model so every iPad is basically going to have track passport attract patio thing to your iPod that I guess you could I suppose if you editing text so that's open a text editor like there and yeah it's kind of cool you can select text and stuff and it's probably better than trying to mess around with it the touch features of text anything but really it's just one of those kind of minor additions to iPad OS 13.4 rather than an upgrade to the 2020 iPad Pros about who should get the iPad Pro basically said at the start of this video I think there are very very few people in the world who you truly need an iPad Pro if you were genuine professional who uses an iPad 4 Pro devil things like video editing photo editing like reproduction and you need every ounce of processing power that you can get them but but but the people aren't watching a video like this sensitive when it comes to things like Pepperwood to come out and I did all my music production on iPad Pro it would just be a no-brainer I would just buy the latest iPad Pro because I might as well I'm a professional and making money from it I'm easy going to make that money back for practically everyone else like the iPad Pro iPad Pro do you know the difference apple pencil support it's kind of nice that if he using an apple pencil sticks to the top and charges like that rather than doing that weird thing we're kind of sticks out of sticks out of the side with the lightning Port as a very minor I didn't get to work the extra money that you're paying for the iPad Pro ultimately my personal opinion which I'm going to Charlene tonight because that's what you do on the internet my personal opinion is that the only reason watching this video again on iPad Pro is if you are desperate for the best hardware because it is it is just a database Latino it's in the iPad Air you're desperate for the best hardware and you have a ton of spec have to burn because really like the time on this is no other reason like literally you have the cash to burn and if we going to get it I've got the cash to burn and as a wannabe take YouTuber I have every reason to just I might as well upgrade to the latest iPad Pro because you know basically off my channels take him to the bed but even with all that in mind I know I'm going to return these and I'm having reviewed them ultimatum returns policy because they just don't offer anything over the 2018 iPad Pro to add insult to injury I kind of prefer 2018 keyboard folio compared to d20srd don't like having a little bit more travel than these Keys over here but I'm so used to typing Smart Keyboard folio just one of the nicest typing experience has ever invented when I was typing on this new 2029 11 inch and I'm going to be hanging onto my trusty 2018 iPad Pro that I've been taking everywhere with me and using for hours and hours every day that's going to continue should anyone else if you're interested in learning more about which iPad you should get which iPad you should buy and it's an analysis of the iPad budget the iPad Mini the iPad Air and the iPad Pro and I made that last year but it's still as relevant this year as it was last year because basically nothing has changed essentially between the iPad Pro 2020 video actually reason to hit a million views and it seems to be resonating with people sell put a link of the hair and individual description if you want to check that out. Give you perfect. And some Will Survive hard to get 2018 iPad Pro for $500 whatever should you get it yeah it's really no different the iPad Air but if you can get it for the same price then this will the apple pencil looks on to it I think is I'm going to be sticking with the 2018 iPad Pro review the magic keyboard when I come down. Should be an exciting thing but it should be compatible with the 2018 iPad Pro basically it's Overkill almost certainly don't need an iPad Pro if you want to get one you want me to disappointed it's the best iPad Apple ever made August 8th it's the best tablet on the market hands-down the most people it's one of my favorite all-time but what iPad you should buy I have no video stay safe stay home and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hear my name is Junior doctor whitening Cambridge books that have changed my life over the last few years and I'll be sharing some of them sponsoring this video their fantastic app that lets you read summaries of popular non-fiction books so you can learn lessons from them and at the end of the video I'll talk about the value that I drive from Lancaster and how it fits into my life as a doctor's last YouTuber this is the 4-Hour workweek by Tim Ferriss subtitle escape the 925 live anywhere and join the new Rich about his story but also give me some tips about how you can if you want to quit your job and set up businesses automated streams of income and creating a system whereby your businesses are generating you money without you having to physically do what for the end then you able to travel the world for the lifestyle that everyone thinks it's just the exclusive domain of rich people like for example when I was growing up I just had in my head this vague notion that one day I'll be cool to be rich and if I would I guess cuz if you're ready then you can like travel and stuff and then you don't have to work and stuff. this whole life of a rich person I am just the audio of being able to travel and live on a beach in Thailand all this other stuff is available surprisingly cheap late like for just a few thousand dollars per month you can live like a really really really rich person in places like Thailand and like Argentina this whole thing that will get trained to do re work very hard to go to a good University get a fantastic job look super super super hot and then make love the money so that when you retire then you can be happy rather than doing that instead it's more about you know why we why we looking to retire when we're not 60 the Mughal osteoarthritis in both of these instead why don't we take those 20 years of retirement and spread them out throughout our life so he He suggests that we will try the thing of mini retirement where each year you take a few months off and you go traveling while running your business remotely from your laptop or whatever if you have even a passing interest in entrepreneurship or something for your business or if the idea of being able to travel the world while your businesses generate money while you sleep if not seems remote entry key to you then you should definitely read this book to be honest I probably read it right but pretty much single-handedly allowed me to set up my business so I set up a company while I was in medical school 6 years ago 2013 medical school applicants that made like an online question Bank online courses and pretty much every year since it started with five-figure corporation tax bills thank you not company alongside studying medicine at Cambridge and doing reasonably my exams because of the stuff that I learned in this book sold the productivity trainer tips and tricks things like Outsourcing to remote workers that was a big reason as to why Slavic Russian Banks already successful a big reason as to why destroyed by you know the challenge of running a company alongside being a medical student so this is all the stuff. that's alright this is a tiny book called show your work by Austin kleon and this has been another book that has been ready pivotal to my life but yeah I'm going to revisit whatever I pick it up this is a book in my life because for a long time like ever since I've been sort of toying with the idea of setting up a personal blog and kind of writing about some of the lessons I gained and your book reviews and things like that and I've never been able to get over the fear of personal Excel promotion that you know it's going to judge me people going to think I'm an arrogant narcissistic twat for having the audacity to have a Blog dinner with my jameliah.com stuff and then in January 2016 I read show your work by Austin kleon I'm not completely change the game for me and maybe realize that even if you're not an expert in anything just the fact that you have done anything I told means that you can then right experience and there will be people somewhere in the world who will find that helpful so for example setting up a lot of people would be interested in that for I thought about it and just kind of help another main idea of this book says that by sharing your work with the world you are working towards helping people and that is going to be an inherent good so after reading this I start my own blog I thought I brought him a few posts that year and I think if it hadn't been for this I wouldn't have even set up this YouTube channel because starting a blog was too small step that made me comfortable with the idea of putting myself out there and you know I've had so many messages from people off the advice for starting a YouTube channel and get over the fear I think you're taking small steps reading this book lets you see that actually that isn't really much to be afraid of and sharing yourself and you'll work with the world is only really going to be a good thing if the message that you're sharing is positive like over over 2,000 messages and comments from people around the world have been inspired or have learned something from the content that I put out from the work that I shed should and I think if it weren't for this book. I read three years ago thank you for encouraging me to become more okay with the idea of putting myself out there if there's something that you haven't even told about if you have something to say if you think you might have something to say if you'd like the idea of maybe writing stuff and sharing over the world if you make any kind of contact at all if you only if you're not if you're painter if you were right there any benefit from reading this book because it's cool we can buy on Amazon like it did mine and last but not least is anything you wants this again really tiny book by Derek sivers that takes like half an hour to read as well 14 Essence for a new kind of entrepreneur can you look for this book has anyone everyone everyone should read this book because it's a lot of lessons for life not just for entrepreneurship this impact on me as well and he changed my life gruet to like an ATM operation with millions and millions and revenues and sold it for like $20 and gave that money to chargeable trust musical education about his story of how he got started with a company but also a very counterintuitive approach to business and also to life is not chasing growth all the time and actually just trying to make some things that you enjoy running and you enjoy the process often you having fun in that you're helping people the world here where every startup is just a means to get that billion dollar valuation Growth Oil cost for this was like a very nice very nice thing that I always hold ready there because when I was in my fourth year approaching the end of my fourth year of medical school I've been running my company for that for like 3 years at that point and we've been growing in terms of Revenue every year in terms of student number as it was taking up more more of my time but then around 2016 all growth started to stagnate and even dip a little I'd already experienced anything like that before where do you grow in something he keeps on growing and then suddenly it stops and then you're like oh wow it's on the decline and this made me really sad during the summer holidays my fourth year and I can remember kind of lying in bed awake thinking and I would have gone wrong have I screwed up my life by throwing away. and I came across this book does one quote in particular that I want to share from here and it's on the show me about how sometimes NBA types is right as a percentage of gross what are your projections for your company and he's talking about his own company I just say I have no idea I don't even know what that means as a hobby to help my friends and that's the only reason it exists there's money in the bank and I'm doing fine so no worries this is probably my favorite quote of all time and I quote that I returned too many times a month whenever I'm feeling down or whatever I'm feeling never forget why you really doing what you're doing are you helping people are they happy are you happy are you profitable isn't that enough? And this is just like if they're a if there are three lines like anytime I read this feel like doing stuff like running a business while you're aiming for growth in revenues and profits and stuff having this like social media for everything that I'm not doing in my life exception of my full-time job making stuff and then trying to grow the brand or subscribe account on the revenue or whatever and that can be quiet I want to stress that often plays in my mind I don't know if other people doing this sort of stuff that it plays in their minds as well and the idea being that whenever you're relaxing or spending time with friends and family you should have in the back of your mind you're thinking you know I could be making a video right now and they fight you know if I don't run out that that video this week then you know the algorithms not good enough or you know I could be writing a blog post for 6 Med about how medical school right now with him. Rank is Holly for such an optimization the movie will go to find out of nowhere anytime you're not working you feel super super super guilty for it and you already enjoy life because you have this amazing thing that do you know by the grace of God you got this. YouTube channel this company and you know you have to keep putting work into them to make them grow but you also want to live a life on the side. Just this this quote it's just it's amazing like never forget while you're really doing what you're doing are you helping people are you happy are you profitable isn't that enough so whatever I find myself thinking you know I should make another video so I can something about odd Revenue Zorro I just read that because I just makes me appreciate that the revenue is important you know I'm enjoying what I'm doing which is fantastic and goes amazing thing going on the side in addition to my full-time job which I was quite enjoy it's making incredible amount of money that I ever dreamed I could have been making special at this age doing it nothing people happy watching these videos I hope people happy holding these videos a lot of burnouts with in entrepreneurship working too hard to grow the numbers to grow the organs to grow everything and I think of anyone is stuck in that position is one of my favorite books had a big impact on my life because it's helped me become more happy and at peace with this whole kind of running an online entrepreneurship Empire Bank have a stronger online okay this whole week has been a lot more fully than I intended but if you guys enjoyed it if you didn't you let me know in the comments or if you didn't again I'd love to hear some constructive advice as to what you would do differently if I do want to do more book reviews and stuff and I've read a lot of books over the years navigate to DeLand thank you think it would look more in a second I do want to talk more about books on the tunnel and yeah that would be great to tell you about blinkist which is a fantastic app takes all the important lessons from thousands of nonfiction books and they summarize them into these like 15 minutes summary that you can either read or listen to so the while using kisses that if I ever come across a recommendation for a nonfiction book I searched through blinkist and see if can find it on my library this is a quick stroll through some of the books that I've read on thinking and essentially they summarize the Salient points of the book in the series of like an AR-15 true in about 15 minutes if you like me and you find yourself strapped for time and you have all these book recommendations being thrown at you and you just don't know where to begin this is a great place to start where you can read a summary of the book get the most important lessons untreated public Sophia 4-Hour Work Week for a buddy Seth Godin marketing books 7 habits of highly effective people that was one that I read on thinkest it's a massive book I've never read in real life but because I don't think it's a few. I've got the main lesson from it so I haven't needed to read in real life or just saved me I think it's pretty great and if you want to try it then there's a link in the description of a pair of here and the first 200 people to use that link will get unlimited access to blinkist premium subscription where you go access to all of that Library thousands of books completely free you like it then if you do like it if use my code and then you'll get 25% off a paid subscription as well I'd recommend I think there are a lot of lessons that you can gain from the non-fiction books I think the fact that they're real samurais and think it means that is very easy to access and you know it does cost a bit of money for an annual subscription but if you're anything like me then you know ideas from a single book can completely change your life so you know why no saliva and I'll continue to use blinkist whenever I get a recommendation to decide if I want to read the book so yeah I think so much play thumbs up if you haven't subscribed the channel then placed into the tank so have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video goodbye"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to my channel can you hear my name is Ali I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is the first in the new series where each month I'm going to be talking about my favorite things I've discovered that month so things like books blog post articles podcast product stuff. in my life and I want to stay with you guys each month hopefully that's what I'm going to be about my favorite things from January 2018 everything is going to be * * below so you don't have to watch the whole video the older you kind of feel like it in a blog which is the Journal of medical ethics blog I thought we recently and absolutely devoured call the mistborn series hand lettering as a concept and not something that I never heard before was not the blog of the Journal of medical ethics I discovered this while preparing for the Charlie Gard video which was on the channel to 3 weeks ago that you missing people seem to like an agenda is a medical journal that published by the British Medical bmj that kind of conglomerate and their Blog has very very accessible articles about interesting Cardiff as a medical ethics topics to spend the last few weeks reading through the backlog of some of them because they're really interesting and cuz I realized Medical Battlefield and especially the way the argument of Praise in the blog it's very it's a very fair than the writing is really good this is guy in brockhampton is absolutely said God is love his style of argument interesting articles I think it was was about Eugenics and a link in the description below butt like you find available studies that show that IQ car lights with socioeconomic status so if you have a higher IQ you tend to be in a higher Social cause they're also a couple of studies that have shown that if you're born into a lower socioeconomic class but you happen to have a like you then that increases your chances of moving up into a higher so she comes across as you girls are so increases social Mobility so the original article was arguing that kind of authority of designer babies and we can select the one that has the highest likelihood of being intelligent or in a having a high IQ Than Ready the same things but again you know that's more than they were saying that if we allow people from lower socio-economic to choose embryos that have higher high propensity for IQ or intelligence then that might be one of the things that tackles social Mobility across across the world he gave his option to poor people the article says then chances are they'll have more intelligent hits and their photos more intelligent kids can rise up out of the low so sweet on the causes and you know we improve social Mobility as a whole appointed position in the cabinet and the two blog post on the Journal of medical ethics plug are arguing against this article they're arguing for the idea that yes well there might be a correlation between IQ and socio-economic Status there are probably confounding factors that explain explain this for example the presence of parasitic diseases that you're more likely to get in a lower social class and those can start your cognitive development which means that you were likely to have a lower IQ as result of it and between the two articles explore this and also the two full of articles on the Jamie block Arlington Globe but yeah that was on the Jamie block and I'm going to be pulling it every week now. No just a quickie mention Feedly like an RSS feed aggregator kind of old-fashioned but like are you Stevie to read all the books are full of these days but otherwise it's such a pain in the bum to manually visit every plug to check on them new articles about from elderberry spokespeople reasons to be cheerful and it's hosted by a politician had miliband Fantasy X how to play party and a radio presenter call Jeff Floyd a very nice good pantries Dynamic training that makes a really interesting listening to one of the live screenings of the LSAT podcast episode about mental health so they were interviewing Elf on the show that he was talking about his new album and also dealing with depression anxiety. For the thing who I used to be the president of the Royal College of psychiatrist metal president had the three of us at the steakhouse in Cambridge a few years ago I was thinking about interesting Cardiff as listen to last week was about prison reform and you know what the call Ron. Whether the prison system should be punitive punishment or Rehabilitation or bit of both that's one thing and they interviewed the guy who runs the prison system of Sweden by op Angel you'd like the prime minister of New Zealand nice bunch of cost of the interview for each podcast just makes me interesting listening especially if you're interested in Cardiff acetyl I'm not overly interested but I really like it when I can get a good balanced distillation of important points about issues like you know the Health Service prisons this on the other so that's only going to be listening to every weekend I'd recommend if you haven't listen to podcast you can listen feminine anything I prefer I just it's just inquiring if user interface to listen to podcast I just commit to it the end of 2017 and absolutely devoured and that's the mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson you might have heard of it maybe don't do this my friend who was recommended to about 10 of my other friends will actually get up there and I've been wrecked the original trilogy the mistborn trilogy is kind of set into the ancient ancient times invented in a different world it's a very through post-apocalyptic the whole world is ruled by this guy called the Lord ruler and then population of Rhode Island for the next and the nobility who have the Arizona political battles within the houses that were being the first book of the final Empire is that it follows the story of The Peasant girl who finds out that she is one of the mistborn people special powers of the magic system in in in the series of fighting for saying it's like you eat certain metals and then you can metaphorically burn those metal inside your body and those brawny particular powers like let's say you burn pewter that grunts you super strength for a while that's a you burn are in a if you push or pull metal stuff away from you with with you and people who are mistborn have the power to burn all eight metals that I have all these different power so they can cause one to find out that she's on the mistborn healthier who is also present but is the leader of the crew of Thieves that steal from the nobility and the book is sensor on this idea that they're plotting to overthrow the final Empire they want to defeat the Lord ruler they want to kill him they want to give power back to the people take it away from the nobility and that's the premise of the first book and the trilogy is absolutely incredible as I was reading it I thought it might knock Harry Potter off the best series I've ever had on reflection Harry Potter is still probably up there just because of the whole childhood thing associated with it and it's like a place in my heart for the mistborn trilogy is a very very very close second and have some time to read books I think it's amazing. That's that I kind of set in the future if you hundred years so you have like guns and things other than swords next year is going to be another installment of that and that's going to apparently it cause little things together and Brandon Sanderson is building up this world where eventually stuff is going to start like coming together at some point in the future in a few years. so I'm going to read a all the other books that he's written because apparently the universe is often kind of touch one another and I quite like the idea of that book about hand lettering and that is something that I discovered like literally a few weeks ago on Instagram on YouTube and the seems to be with hole like a whole subculture of people doing hand lettering like really really well images of screen of examples of what I mean and I find stuff like this go down the rabbit hole to the internet and YouTube and stuff and you and you discover that out this voice to learn this and this equipment you need and how you got started so from next weekend was looking to start just like digging his course and hand lettering and I was going to do it in real life I think everybody nice to kind of get into this and maybe for birthday cards over thank you called whatever just like doing custom custom designs Instagram help my general web design skills because being able to create custom typography for tachos is is something that I've thought about for a while but didn't realize that she could do it so yeah but yeah that is 1/4 of my favorite things for January 2018 series of books which I would highly recommend that finally I have lettering that I've recently come across but that I want to explore in more detail sir posted a favorites from January February and so on and it seems like a good thing to do because often I consume a lot of content but don't really think about it a lot I think if in the back of my mind I'm thinking off I want to talk about my favorite things it does this make the cut I think that'll encourage me personally to be a bit more effective of the stuff that I do read and the book. Sorry I listened to and so on yep thank you very much for watching a video please give it a thumbs up if this is a thing that you think I should continue it or if you think that you know if you'd like to be shorter or longer or more thing like I want to find out what what you I want to watch otherwise I'm just kind of stopped saying whatever I want to talk about and while I think there is some reason that it's a little too nice to know that the stuff that I I'm saying is I'm making are actually people so if you do video please I would appreciate any constructive criticism but yeah if you know already and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " play friends Enrique commemoration Q&A series cuz that's what people seem to do when you are you too but you do a Q&A when people asking you questions so as usual in the video description around to whatever question interest you the most okay so questionable one comes from Indian ginger on Twitter and says hey how did you figure out what you wanted to do when you chew before you started half. Thank you very much before I started YouTube I didn't really know what I wanted to do I knew that I wanted to create educational content medical students to help Market my business which was for teaching courses for medical applicants and a new I want to add that then after that on your wanted to make logs but actually back in the day we like 2008 when I first decided I want to be YouTuber she wanted to do something like music production stuff I wanted to be the next coach Snyder restart realize that you start kind of missing down and realizing the bits that resonate with people the pits that don't I think it's a case of trying a lot of things seeing what's fun in stings and seeing what sticks and the stuff that was fun they actually also seem to state which is quite convenient the productivity study tips education side of things and so that's what I've thought about you so I think not my followers probably don't know that I have a stutter at the age of five ish and it used to be quite bad to the start of secondary school that's now a lot better and I find it it really is a lot better when I get a good amount of sleep Asotin would die unless it's that I also don't like these injuries and ends and soften what I have to do is when I'm when I'm speaking I'm sort of planning ahead in my head cuz I know that if one of these Bee Gees or and wood comes up. I'm going to have swapping out for different wood on the Fly and it's quite annoying when it comes to telling jokes because often if I'm in a group situation and I think of an amazing joke but the woods just won't come out talk about very much is from hamoed on who says any tips for someone just starting out on YouTube yeah if you think supposedly focus on quantity or quality videos but I got from my friend Simon who I followed for a long time and we became friends in real life reason a few months ago and he said this in a video like three years ago I watched that video and he said you'll first 50 videos going to be old. as soon as possible I would extend that I would tell you first a hundred videos going to be absolutely terrible to the sooner you can make those a hundred terrible videos the sooner you can get to actually, focusing on your channel actually things starting to work properly because I think the problem that we all have whenever giving you is that would too focused on trying to make it good and like we haven't had the idea of what makes a good YouTube video and I'll first few attempts I'll just nowhere near that the the wrong thing to do is to just not publish them or think I'll need to improve first bite running up quantity eventually the quality improves and you'll be so glad that you've turned out the quantity because it's so much of a better than experience than to just try and ready Kind of Perfect those one about that one video that will be the main thing I say is amazing it's absolutely change the lives of a lot of people I know who could have taken it seriously Anthony consistently over a very long. Of time but it does require a huge amount of consistency over very long. Of time and the fact that you can make money from it without people watching it having to pay anything at all it's completely next level like there are so few business models that work on that basis so yeah it videos and then who says what is the most important principle in your life and I think for me that really varies depending on what stage of Life at the moment the main thing on front optimized for is do the stuff that is fun in the short-term but that contributes to kind of momentum plans and plans to have long-term plans for keeping my options open for the down the line and physical Daniel Brook to have a great Friday to equals Randomness and optionality basically given that the world is so uncertain like 3 years ago I would have no idea that YouTube was going to be such a big part of my life and now it is having like a 5-10 year plan just because things change so so often I'm so a principal that I try and live by these days is I want to try and maximise the optionality and the kind of the run to miss I have in any ideas that you want to increase the surface area opportunity in life's about when interesting serendipitous opportunity to come along you can you can see them and so like right now the decision I'm making a do I want to stay in Cambridge brother for a long. Of time and applied to a training pathway in medicine in the UK travel around the world for a while after the whole bar situation gets voted I want to move to a different country to practice medicine and I think things like traveling the world and moving to a different country or both of those keep my options a lot more open and Max optionality into staying in the UK I'm staying in the same place and Nina being very comfortable so that's kind of think about these days what book is your favorite and I actually got a copy of the original the first one in series but I think Breaking Dawn the fourth one is program with probably my favorite just could have such a riveting read and it goes comes to a really nice like sort of action eBay at the end find the end of book one when via James kidnaps Bella with something and it becomes a little like action-packed I much prefer this will be robots I prefer then you can save them for longer and yeah I need to give a public thank you to Thomas Frank for changing my life cuz we have Skype call around like September 2019 and he introduced me to D2 standard which is the YouTube agency that I'm not positive such a great team to be part of an identity change my life so thank you tell me if you watching this video first thing I think of getting a Kindle like in 2008 and reading a lot has added an enormous amount of value to my life and there's a phrase from I think is it is it Charlie Munger who says every single successful person says that they read a lot and every single successful person also says that every successful person they know also reads a lot when you look at everyone in history that's excessive they can always so I'd like a ton of bricks that very much me like the single biggest Harbour is just now I read quite a lot of nonfiction stop before bed so that's been pretty useful second have it probably listening to podcast in the car at Double speed for the most part unless I need to send them down to Ford warranty on a single speed, because they say what's the point of rushing through life but you know when you're in the city of learning learning phase and you want to cut a circle with information and nothing listening to podcasts at Double speed makes perfect sense and at least it works for me Kodi capture have it which I came across and David Allen getting things done which is like a Cossack productivity Bible but they capture have is basically the idea that our brain is designed for having ideas for storing them until anytime I have I'm thinking of my friend right to down in some capacity somewhere usually in some kind of app and that means that my brain is actually free or two just like not worried about storing detail and storing things that I have to do installing conduit a calendar event actually I think unimportant habit it's very much a hobbit ingrained in me to ask myself is disowning Us in my control at if it's not in my control what if I just feel okay it's fine as it is I'm just let it go and just doing that over over the past like decade-plus has an hour like so call Melissa lavoie. So present in my mind that I almost never have negative emotions about anything at all because they immediately got you know this this treatment of is it in my control number 5 I'm going to say brushing my teeth most days probably decided body to my life because it means my teeth have survived. what is a micro efficiency that you do on a daily basis that saves you many minutes of time over a long. That is such a great question the biggest micro efficiency I'll do is that when I use a computer I try and avoid using the mouse I try not to keyboard shortcut on the app that makes a super easy to do on a map is gold Alfred and I cannot live without its saved me so much time over time and now when I see people picking with a mouse it's just so frustrating you can go so much faster on a computer by navigate some of the people using something like Alfredo and is also the windows if you wanted those heathens that uses windows and as, efficiencies those few seconds saved in each infraction really add up to I was over long. Of time so that would be a thing that I would recommend no rights next we have a question from Craig Davidson thank you Craig who says if you could put one thing on a billboard what would it be and I'm going to cheat here I'm going to use something announce it from one of the guests on the Tim Ferriss show black I'm blanking and who it was maybe we'll have to go to Navy without service but probably it would be it would make you happy and that's only because it's not something that I have to remind myself about like especially when it comes to buying stuff it's just I always have to remind myself buying this thing is not going to make you happy and I think that's a message that we could help from Will loves yellow William he says what are three things you enjoy by the medical field and what are three things you dislike about the medical field much love and support from California whole thank you very much so three things I like about the medical field friendly I like the fact that you got to talk to patients and touch the lives and hopefully positive way and I like the teamwork Emerald revive that goes with it an especially strong during this like coronavirus. It really feels like we're part of a baked family and it looks like a very nice feeling country things I dislike I dislike the the sense of martyrdom that allowed medical students in junior doctor seems to have that oh my God my life is so hard I'm working so hard like everyone's doing their bit I don't think is this is helpful thing this like a backward that is technologically losing at least in the UK the national service in the NHS is fantastic and so many ways but what is not fantastica is innovation because usually when there's no profit there's no real Dri-Fit Innovation so you know we still use systems that are that look like they were designed in the early 2000s or even my Windows 95 level of user interface big deal about it and sadly I don't really like how for a lot of Medics their job is all-consuming like that because of how kind of the world can be in the hours and stuff mostly when people get into medical school they're very well-rounded people with lots of hobbies and musical instruments these fun things in sports that they do but then most people I speak to them afterwards they say they end up not able to continue doing those things because of how demanding the job is what house are you I have never done the quiz on Pottermore but I have a Gryffindor scarf and a Gryffindor hat so I would call myself a Gryffindor for now another quick one from Costa Coffee for Life Is Good advertising who says what's your favorite takeaway # delivery for Life spelled wrong and start with an e maybe it's ironic I don't know these days my favorite takeaways roosters.. We used to go to that quite a lot when me and my family used to live in Southend-on-Sea in Essex they speak one near the Town Center so we do that very regular but now the ones recently opened up in Cambridge and they do delivery by delivery so I actually ordered from that for lunch and I'm going to order from that for dinner again all right now we are in this cupboard where I keep my wireless router allowed to open all the charges and all these would have accessories and stuff incomes from James Elliott Hughes who says what would you say is the most valuable thing you done outside of your academic / medical career that's very easy like about you to myself it's giving me a lot of opportunities in low-income a little nice things have happened to me as a result of it but hopefully also value to other people and if the messages of United emails and stuff anything to go by and it sounds like a little female these days people saying that the study techniques have changed a life for you know the f*** out that me and my brother on this particular helpful in Olduvai is a result of this YouTube channel in the associated activities we have a question from Jared cover who says on the Block I know that not many people will be interested in it and therefore it won't get many Rita's do you think there are still benefits to writing a Blog in this case but yes I was thinking article down below from a guy called to David perel who is another sort of it it's called The Ultimate Guide to writing online and the Katy makes it that writing online like basically having a Blog is the single fastest way to accelerate your career of no matter what you're doing so whatever you doing writing online is the way but yeah the starts when you publishing stuff no one's going to read it because you don't really have anything useful starting a blog is very much one of those flywheel things like a flywheel device that stores mechanical rotational energy very slow to get going but once you get over once it gets going it's Unstoppable and it's the same of the YouTube channel that the same with starting any sort of Adventure that's based around this stuff that had to start no one will care and you have to you'll feel as if you are shouting into the void but more you can do it the more consistent you can do it and the more kind of value you can try an ads with the stuff that you're writing overtime by publishing weekly or twice weekly blog post every single week for two years at that point you can start look even contraction if that's what a timer ryzen bothers you then it's probably not for you but I would say absolutely go for it doesn't matter if you don't have read is initially it's kind of a good thing actually because it means you can experiment a lot with the soda continue making without worrying about appeasing the audience which is something that people with bigger audiences have to worry about to get good luck for us who says oh you more towards time management or attention Management in terms of product some good Buzz with their so has been historically about time management like how do you figure out what to do with the time that you have how do you optimize you a time to do appropriate things but recently it's so to start moving towards attention management. that we will have limited it's it's not really that we have a limited amount of time but actually we have a limited amount of attention and so we should be focused on the things that we spending our attention on rather than necessary things we spending all time on for me give him that I have a full-time job I am still very much any time management comp because my time is physically limited by virtue of having a full-time job I also having to do two things to do with all the other stuff on the side that I do and so I I really care a lot about optimizing the time that I spent attention is not really limiting factor for me at the moment but I can see that if I if I didn't have a full-time job and I was a full-time Creator or something then it really would be a case of attention management much more time the moment time is limiting factor I thought I've never seen a video that's been sponsored by Apple what they do is they send out review units to reviewers sometimes if you're like legit enough and they sent me two homepods to review which I'm going to be in the house of the moment but no I've never got any other products from Apple so I have to just buy the stuff review it and then most of the time I returned it because there were tons of policies ready yet but yeah one day maybe I'll be able to join the review program or something so I'll be good if you could only keep one would you keep the airport so the Apple watch this easy airpods any day of the week the airports are life-changing piece of tech the Apple watch is absolutely no life-changing piece of Apple watches kind of nice to have but it's actually overall very useless need anything already use it for his Apple pay and I don't even wear to work because the infection control especially with a coronavirus stuff when you allowed to have anything yet we have to be bare below the elbows and so my watch basic the old am aweary on weekends and when I'm off work where are the airports are life-changing inventions because the airport to make it so much less friction to listen to things like audiobooks and podcast and through having at the airport cost on a 3 year since they came out listen to so much more audio content than I would have done otherwise and that overall has massively massively helped my life where the Apple watch is just a slight Flex that you can show up when you're using Apple pay with your watch so yeah airport any day of the week Robidoux Balaban Popa who says if the internet would be down for a month what would you do on 4 month I would do more exercise read more books. Take notes on multiple books I would I would learn how to dance and I would get much more into music theory and learning about music and stuff on the internet currently distract me from all of those things so that would be the stuff that I would do if the internet went down and are you planning on letting to cook more food to the best thing I can cook it's probably I make a pretty good spaghetti bolognese from scratch last time I made that was about two years ago though and yes I'm trying to learn how to cook these days in the hole isolation thing not so much I'm going to mow living off takeaways at the moment but I think it's a special time but I do want to prioritize kind of cooking and healthy eating and stuff in my life sooner rather than later so yeah productive healthy affections and reasonably priced meals that I can just kind of do without thinking about it too much or I text we have Aaron Taylor who says what's the best way to learn how to code / build website hacked how to code is buy electronic online course there are so many of them these days people sometimes email me asking me how do you learn to code and the question doesn't make sense anymore because I first learned to code in like 2007 and the market has changed the landscape of coding has changed so much in the last 13 years. It doesn't matter how you know you said w3schools and random Snippets of JavaScript online and stuff like that blond recommended on bring a dog to not even sponsoring this video being a brilliant to Whole Foods I can eat that go really good python course. That link will give you 20% off Lincoln of a description the North Pole from the video but what website is different though go to website for extended website you can just use something like Squarespace or Wix or probably the easiest ones if you want to build a website that has certain functionality like a web app at that point you start having to potentially learn how to code but even so there are so many NOCO to these days. The whole I need to learn how to code thing even though I've been peddling that narrative for a while it's no longer strictly true I think it still is helpful to learn how to code just because it gives you an idea of what's possible where is prior to learning how to code you might not know about that you don't actually need to kind of sit down and write code that affects the last few years I haven't really written much code because now that I know the very basics of coding I know what I can build with no code tools and I know I can just hire people who know how to cut properly to come to do what I need to do so codecademy code School bring into Ocala / I leave for letting the coast and then building website just he Squarespace or something simple 5.5 years want to see the thing that I would do more often as I would take more notes on the books that I was reading there is a good book by some PRN. His name is Claude how to take smart notes I'm reading that moment and it's blowing my mind so I would 5 years ago 10 years ago 15 years ago every single thing that I've ever read books articles podcast I would make it a point to take some notes on them and figure out my own thoughts on the thing and how it fits into my wider men's full president that kind of stuff that is one thing I wish I was I did more of another thing I wish I'd taken music a bit more seriously I wish I'd gotten better at music theory I've been playing the piano now for actually five years I first started when I was in my third year of medical school and I sort of just the basics and I can come to do the basics I can play chords and sing along but I've never really taken music music theory seriously I've never really learned how to read music that is something that would have been easy enough. and you know if I've been doing it consistently over the last five years I've been off duty pro at this point so taking those from books anyone could do that starting out from today I started doing that like now and music theory is again something I'm actively working on he says what's your goal for the next five years off that's a good question but it's hard to answer because I don't really believe in kind of setting goals as such I'm open to changing my mind on this but I for the last few years I've been easy with the idea of having goals like what is a goal like what's in it it's a goal of mine to be financially independent I am not replying from my job for my income and that's that's kind of true now I don't need to I don't need my job as a doctor in order to survive don't hit that goal but beyond that I don't really have any others really I'd like to keep having fun and doing what I'm doing but I don't feel that any deficiency my life. I need to go for I'd like to travel a bit more maybe like to keep my options open I'd like to explore the world that's one of a goal but again you can just use under B be happy with just like forever rather than thinking about goals at such Solomid on surf basic goals from Sofia to the Beet smoothie good name who says if you could is any other career what would it be I am assuming you mean instead of my medical career but you know I would say full-time camping crater in addition to full instead of full-time probably Us automotive business when I was in my second year med school so 2013 and that was really really really fun for the first few years what it was growing and what it was interesting and that's is like a really cool stuff and now. I'm trying to set up a few other businesses and I have always enjoyed that side of it and I've been trying to set up businesses every year since like I was 13 years old with my friend James and I just was being very exhilarating Android phone country if so where yes I'm actually contemplating but at the moment so I've been living in the UK since 2003 I'd quite like to check out America for a bit I quite like to check out Australia New Zealand for a bit I like the idea of Hong Kong I like the idea South Korea I like the audio Argentina a country would be cool to live in for some.

            "text": " this is it this is literally what I've been waiting for my entire life echo echo combat to the channel if you knew homonymous Orleans adults are working in the UK and on this channel tools that help us live happier more productive lives is not fun not the iPad Pro has been one of the key Tools in my productivity Arsenal since way back in 2017 and I actually do really like the old people photo it was bus when I first saw the ad for the new magic keyboard I nearly had a stroke is this thing just looked absolutely incredible for the first time this is the first impressions review and it has so far completely blown me away important thing and that is keyboard the question is how fast can I type on this thing this is the best words per minute I've ever go in my life privacy Morocco 154th on the old version of the Apple magic keyboard this is the first time I have ever typed on this matter keyboard the first half in just a few bits here and there 1562 accuracy 23% yeah the keyboard is always a fantastic like it feels exactly like the MacBook Air scissor kind of keyboard which is now what the what the keyboard mechanism is on a D16 in Roswell and this just just feels taking us to the Keys in space why is good Everything feels well proportioned uni-grip I would have with it slightly is that as I'm kind of typing in this configuration my Hondas occasionally hitting that if I do like a bit kind of motion instead of that kind of thing than my hand does occasionally brush against the bottom the iPad Pro in this ocean figuration I imagined in this position is no problem at all but in this one which is sort of the most horizontal you can get on this it is so annoying but yeah this is just so much better than the old one a bit of a bullock to actually change the backlighting anticon settings and then you have to go and like keyboard keyboard brightness so you can see how the brightness changes as I just thought but to be honest I finally just based on the ambient light sensor the iPad and for the life that is basically the keyboard with trackpad that that's always in the iPad Pro and one of the main reasons why I think you doing an iPad Pro is inherently less efficient than using a problem MacBook is because you have to reach up and touch stuff like if I want to open a safari window the most natural thing to do would be to take on Safari if I want to navigate YouTube the most natural thing to do would be kind of screw biscuit Boston types of self but now this is as good a trackpad as you go in the MacBooks it's a lot smaller or actually clicks rather than just being a. Trackpad but so far it feels really good and I can I can imagine that this is significant increase my productivity only iPad just because having this especially when it comes to adjusting text let's go on bear and if I were to write out drop it feels very natural to use the trackpad 2 I took me because I make money on the internet based off of kind of the stuff that I can produce mostly by writing which sentence into video script this is going to pay for itself it's an absolutely no brain of a purchase cuz even though there's a 350lb help me create one more video Ria. It would have paid for itself like a no-brainer if you'll someone who values productivity and if you can see the return on investment from buying something like this that's not talked about all you can do is you take it off and this thing is very rigid like this is as far as this part of the case goes but it's it's very very well-built it's very is very strong and then you gently place the iPad on and it magnetized it to the back of the thing and I can see that you can totally do this angle which is a bit pointless unless you go to the kind of lying in bed with my be useful and then you can go up to this angle but you can press it down any more than that because they just doesn't work and if you over press then is going to full of it so this is I think a pretty good angle to have keep it on I can't really imagine it having more having it more horizontal unless using apple pencil in with horizontal pencil so the time on notability which is my favorite note taking app for the iPad comparison between notability in goodnotes at some point so maybe if you if you're nauseous and your throat during your over-the-hills-and-far-away kind of painting on the iPad doesn't make sense but that someone is writing on it. We can do as you can put into this or configuration surprise me with writing but that is probably the configuration I would have it in if I was using the apple pencil extensively unfortunately the experience of writing on this is a bit crap the right now cuz I had to order a new one iPads new Paperwhite medical doctor colleagues about what they think about the flowers I really want to flex the phone people cuz I imagine not many people at work live seen this in real life and so people might be like who is that new iPad pro magic he but I'll be like yes thank you for noticing this is exactly why I have it speaking of flex space around it is very very very original don't like this as a whole package feels kind of heavy if you'll be feared than just having the photo case on it and in fact if you look at the comparisons online people have very Klein v Wade Justice keyboard case on the iPad and this way is about 7 supposedly when you have the iPad like this but with this you have to come and get your fingers underneath that job me to have jobs in a little bit Philly to get out but it looks pretty crazy if I say so myself lodging so now this USB port is free to do stuff to be honest I don't tend to plug things into here but now that I've go eat popcorn and I cannot do things like plug in my Samsung T5 potentially even try everything videos off of this essentially photo editing off of this I've got one of these one of these like SD card e-reader top things to be a state called in and I would still have possibly charging if I'm doing something scented like editing photos or videos with music production which is something that I want to get into other than that it feels really good closing it like you just kind of press it and then garish embossing yeah I mean this is absolutely sick a little bit in different places around the house so be right back so good I feel like a genuine Port City Grease Monkey on a popping on this okay ready to go to the phone like this what about like this a bit more wise if it were real laptop I guess you could put it over the edge a little bit more but this one is mine top heavy so it probably will fall over and now I am in bed flying colors work beautifully on the sofa and on the bed insert keyboard into keyboard case it probably protects the iPad of Fab it's it's going to be a bit weird getting used to opening it kind of the wrong way around I am huge excited by the the best keyboard is going to bring it to me just as a sort of First Impressions this is the single best product I've used in a very very long time there's really nothing about the second fold other than the price it's quite offensive it's 300 lb of 300 54.9 inch but like I said for me and for other people I know the return on investment for this is going to be it's going to make an absolute no-brainer if your student do you need it probably know if you're a student and you have loads of fat cash to burn then get it yet you won't be disappointed this fantastic if you like this and you want to see a comparison of the 11-inch was a 12.9 inch and he'll the reasons why I put the 12.9 inch now and why I was wrong about why I used to think 11 inches better than to take the video over there I don't know which one to get then click the video here which will be a long in-depth analysis exactly which iPad you should get thank you so much for watching and seeing the next video"

Company. They need to buy breakfast at work but I ended up having lunch at work and I'll go to very healthy tuna and cheese melt toastie with chips into such as ketchup the full-time 20 while I was eating my lunch peaceful one of my colleagues made some disparaging remarks about my healthy eating and so encouraged me to buy this book from Amazon which I bought there and then because I'm trying to eat healthier USB C charging cable for 1299 absolute report but had to be done very dry and so I messaged my brother asked and he recommended go to lb 99 Peach on the way home I stopped off at a grocery store to meet up with a fan from America and his friend and I bought all those coffees that was 1690 and then also playing badminton other local time in club I stopped off at the same grocery store Sainsbury's and bought 14036. groceries which included a female dog to have for dinner that evening and again there was about 80 miles of driving to buy 11 lb of fuel so overall on Tuesday I spent a total of 70 lb and 66p can I go a Starbucks small latte this time on the way to work and that was 3015-p I didn't even spend any money at all on breakfast or lunch because we had this special simulation Training Day the hospital and lunch was provided which is fantastic another Starbucks at 3:15 that evening I treated myself to a takeaway from gbk this with the Camembert and cranberry chicken burger for 11:20 and I both side of Looney bites which was full pounds in 2017 light and so overall the cost for me cuz I stay with my housemate was 12 lb so overwhelming Wednesday I spent 43 pounds of 87p which is $57.91 on Thursday for breakfast the day off work another take away for lunch I said this was another Camembert and Brie Bella get from gbk 411 Pain 27p what's next in total that day I drove around 14.6 miles to get to this college and back against that was 1 lb and not to pee with a field which brings us to a total for Thursday for 24 lb and 19p which is apparently $31.94 on Friday oat milk latte small 15 that's my mid-morning snack I got a croissant with Jam from the host of the restaurant for 110-90 at the Friday until I go fish and chips from the again what's the restaurant which is Fantastic Four 5 * 50 and then me and my brother were driving up to you quotes is app-like National Park in the UK to spend the weekend with some friends and so that evening I could a vegan burger from KFC for 5 lb in 89 be out in front of battery so that we could record a podcast in the car if you don't know me and my brother have a weekly podcast description anyway the batteries 435 my fuel cost of 18 lb. We got was about 24.50 per person per night at that on bringing us 63 lb of 97p which is $84.46 then we go the weekend so on Saturday morning we went out for breakfast in some nice light hipster looking Cafe in this like nearby this fancy coffees that we were living in breakfast with pretty good I got myself is Hash potato avocado Moto egg type thing along with an O grade T4 total of 10 lb we we had breakfast quite late afternoon tea in the same Cafe and I got myself a chai latte plus some toast and butter and jam and that was for cost of full-time 64 seafood stew calamari sauce has a lime and lemon drink thing and a chocolate brownie for 30 lb total Anaconda Airbnb with 24.50 bringing us to a total of 69 lb in Tempe or $91.24 on Sunday for breakfast Cafe Agora I got a veggie bank robber meal for 7 p.m. 9552 12 lb and 25p skip this song cuz I thought I was going to be healthy for dinner we had rice and other ghosts made by my mom which is right now 28p or $45.26 so that was what I spend on a day-to-day basis but I was want to talk about all my various other fixed costs like the mortgage bills Broadband council tax all that kind of stuff and also all the money they spend on apps the money to afford these like ridiculous coffees in lunches and lime trip to Nova. One of the main reasons that is that apart from my full-time job as a doctor I also have various different online businesses that I've been building since like 8:15 so when I was in secondary school 12 years old I taught myself how to code a building websites and try to make businesses sort of evidence and those towards late to have my life ended up getting more successful than I thought and that ended up making me lunch money and if you're interested in maybe letting that for yourself the code is a fantastic website called brilliant for sponsoring this video brilliant is an amazing math science and computer science learning education platform they've go online courses and also to topics and the nice thing about it is that it's not just videos that you is an interactive bits of an animation that was cool stuff that helps you the other Concepts easier and one branch of CO2 that I found very helpful at the computer science on so they will regard course on the fundamentals of computer science like how algorithms where I can help computers work and how coding like works from a first principle. fantastic codes on Python and python is the world's most popular programming language and by going through the particles in bringing you can actually learn Parts into a pretty good sand it and you can do the interactive problems to help you apply your knowledge apartments different scenarios you'll be able to use Python to do that and hopefully make money on the side if that's if that's what you want to do with your life so the challenge but you have to think about it a little and so often if I go 5 minutes like on the bus or the Train on the toilet or something I just go through the day challenges and I feel like it kind of helps exercise my mind so if any of that sound of fuel straight then you should definitely go to Shelly and the first 200 people to click on that link which will be in the description will get 20% off an annual premium subscription or life maintenance expenses. I've got so the mortgage that I pay is about 1250 pounds per month and then on top of that we've got about 200 pounds a month in tons and rent and maintenance fees which is what you pay when you live in an apartment building like this one actually besides I'm living with a housemate who pays me rent is really good because the rent that she pays covers the interest on the mortgage and it also covers the ground rent in maintenance cost can I pay each month is pure principal is going back into the body of the houses going back into repaying the mortgage and so in total living in this house cost me 850 lb month but actually paying off the principal of the mortgage that money does actually going down the drain on interest a grand right and maintenance 12 * 54 week next week Bishop with which I share with my housemate and we paid 90 pounds a month each for that is qualified to Jim is like a spa and stuff it's going to gym but I personally think it's totally worth it and I just find myself was why wouldn't you value your health being a member of a fancy Jimmy Carter's need to go to the gym more and I think that's going to be worth it in the long run by the gym cause nausea comes month which again 22 x 52 week for Broadband for high speed internet which is 300 megabits per second in megabits per second upload it cost 60 lb what's 15 times a week are Christian gaseous play evenly with my housemate and for me that's 25 pounds a month so that six-month 25 per week about 15 pounds a month so 3lb 75 per week my car insurance is unfortunately. 700 pounds a year which comes out to Townsend 46p a week and on average over the last like 5 years it's cost me about a thousand pounds a year to like various maintenance cost of the car like servicing and repairs and stuff so thousand pounds a year comes to 19020 people week 866 pa-315 pounds in 16 P if we're going to include mortgage / rent payments and funny let's talk about all of the different apps that I spend what I thought was a large amount of money on but actually on my preparing the video and adding it all up I realized it was so we got 15 app on this list you would want that I can remember I just searched my computer so first day one which is a journaling out that cost 22 * 49 a year or 43p a week ago Tinder gold which is 41099 people a year people are or 60 90 a week and go drops which is 18 and 49 a year old 35p a week to do it which is 35 lb in weight 35 people week let me go instapaper 2299 a year or 44 people week for goberno taking up 1399 a year or two bad 27p a week we've got hinge premium which is 27 pounds $49 every six months which comes out to 1 pound people week and we going to medium which is 4599 a year or 88p a week the ridiculously priced YouTube premium membership which is 1599 a month or four pounds away and of course Spotify for 9.99 a month or two a week it's not a month and that's one punch 25 awake out of grocery what notion which is one of my favorite productivity apps of all time which is full pounds a month old one pound a week the Adobe Creative Cloud stream in a few other services are ascribed to but I can feasibly get away with calling as business expenses so I'm not going to talk about them in this video and so the total cost of apps is 18 lb and 17p per week food takeaways all that kind of stuff comes out this week to 367 lb + 19 P answer the total amount of money that I spent in this pretty standard week and yeah I went on holiday to the Cotswolds for the weekend to spend just as much if not more money going to and from London and eating out a licetime anyway In This Very standard week of work and having the weekend off in total I spent 488 pound in 50p which comes to $645 and include the cost of mortgage or rent payments at Ulta. 701 lb week or $925 per week surprise me I was surprised at just how much it comes to in total like even if we exclude the mortgage thing 488 * 50 week that's basically 500 Avis 4 weeks in a month about 2,000 pounds a month I'm spending just just to survive with the soda quality of life that I have and the scary thing is that my post-tax income from being a doctor recently has been about 1,900 pounds a month until about an IPO slight deficit I was paying too much tax and so now that that's corrected I think I will just about Break Even or possibly be able to save maybe one or two hundred pounds cuz I think overall my post-tax salary from being a doctor will be 2300 2200 a month and I'm going to be spending like $1,900 a month just to expenses which is a little bit much I kind of wanted that number to be lower table of money by not buying coffee from Starbucks I could save about 23 pounds a week yeah I think I spent 23 lb of 30p this way combined tea and coffee out from work like Waypoint to get myself a small oatmeal. A is one of the things in life that I really enjoy I read a lot of books about special financing videos about it and I really like the god code for me settings approach to this idea is that you don't need to cut out your lattes to save money because if you make the big decisions good like if you reduce the interest rate on your mortgage or if you make more money or pay rise these are huge decisions that really contribute massively to your bottom line where is cussing out at 3 lb The 3lb Latte here and there really doesn't actually contribute much especially if that's the sort of thing that you enjoy it and I definitely do enjoy spending money on coffee I have literally as a result of making this video is that I spent a large amount of money on food at the hospital and there's really no need for this and that's partly why would this new cookbook I sold by so I wanted to see the doctor that was working with I really want to get into this whole like cooking stuff at home doing meal prep all that kind of stuff but the way that I Justified it in the past has been that I'm working at 9 p.m. today 7 in the morning I got home at like 9:30 p.m. and in the evening I am feeling the video because of this video needs to come out next week so I feel like in that context I don't have time to cook for myself and clean up and stuff and therefore I'm totally okay with spending 10 pounds 12:15 total value that I'm getting in my life by the fact that I can make YouTube videos in the evenings while not having to worry about food completely outweighs the 10-15 pounds on us spending take away so that's Justified it to myself so I don't think the economic argument from me personally walks and turns up you could say so much money if you just didn't if you just ate out less I probably could but I think what is telling me is supposedly healthy recipes and stuff and I know eating healthily is like obviously a good thing I'm cooking for myself with always a good thing is like an absolute no-brainer but I just need to actually find a system by which I can do it in a very efficient way and then once I start cooking for myself productive maybe I'll make some more videos about that which might be fun surprising inside if I'm making 8200 like 11 about houses going away on the fact that I have to get to work and then while I'm at work I spend about 15 pounds of food and coffee that goes and then once you could text and things it's just live closer to work but I like you I live in Cambridge place I'm going to set up and everything so overall I think it is worth it for me personally to spend that 11 pounds a day and that those two hours in the car and I'm driving to and from work but as far as like a long-term lifetime goes I definitely much rather be a little closer to work but I want to make more videos about personal finance and I think it's really important or fake I've read a lot about it being on videos about things like investing and compound interest and how mortgages work and how you get a mortgage and how to save a budget even though I don't do that very well I know that you know if you care about personal finance then it's a lot easier easier it's a lot more effective I think to just earn more money by doing other things rather than to cut down expenses but maybe wherever you are if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you block this video you might like to check out some other videos that's a video over there that are linked there somewhere about I'll drink some assumptions were talking a lot more about money and how I made money in her feel about money if you're into that. tablet"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel on to another video Envy monthly favorite series what every month I talked about some of the interesting / cool / maybe interesting things I've discovered that month today we're going to be talking about a physical product a book a podcast and a blog post and as usual time stamps weather going to be like in the video description as the pins, so feel free to skip around you feel like it but now that's just get salted the first thing I want to talk about is disloyal 1917 a V shaped notebook and yeah it's a physical physical Netflix but I found the dotted version by started this on the 24th of May 2019 so in the Lost, 5 weeks for 4400 weeks are filled 80 pages of already hand I found that but if I just have this sitting there with my iPad in front of me or even without my iPad like I went to a coffee shop on just having my my chilate and and this book in front of me sides and ideas for new things I can do on the website and you think I can do this YouTube channel is having like Pages free pages is right whatever in like 4 hours and do diagrams and stuff cuz it's actually been very helpful and I think partly there is a fact that I feel like a bit more about us cuz I mean everyone uses Tech these days but there's something that's something romantic and nice about getting out your physical notebook getting out your pain sipping your latte like a pretentious brighten the thing that it actually encourages me to do more I think at this point because I've been doing it for like the last two years it just feels very normal like that is the sort of writing that I have not used to as the default so when I get my pain out and leuchtturm 1917 notebook if you like it so far hasn't yet letting you make 1% Commission on the sale price of this I think I do this for like 15 pounds of something expensive for Notebook 17 of the other ones that Neil Gaiman uses and he knows what he's doing I talked about this book and last month's video congratulations to the real Jason KO who says an aspiring physician from Canada hey thanks for the inspiring videos would love to receive a copy of the book the real Jason Cote this book is yours all right I'll message if you message me on Instagram will send me an email ICS send me an email and like in the subject line tell me that you love your the winner of this book and include your address and I will mail out a copy of this book to you. Said let's talk about this month book and that is shoe dog by Phil Knight I never thought I'd be wonderful nonfiction incredible it was and how surprised I was that this was like a like an actually good non-fiction known self-help known business econ book I'm going to give other nonfiction books a try one original topography and around the same time someone recommended this book she dope iPhone I don't like the founder of Nike a memoir by the creator of Nike Warren Buffett probably said the best book I read last year Phil isn't Storyteller I'll have to agree with this pretty good it's not it's not like a standard business book which is full of like advice and stuff the story of how Nike is the brand started and how this guy fills his love of running mate him and he liked it here. communicate about running shoes and then he thought he could and then fill so he could go to Japan and manufacture certain type of shook will tigers and how they made the company called blue blue apron add to Nike the brand and I just thought you supposed to eat like a well-written book like it really makes you want to turn the page it really kept me hooked and entertained and on the way he talks about his story is no Turtle dragging it just as a very inspiring Memoir of how much hard work and how much can a grind goes into building something like Nike and a low-end does love interesting have inside long the way about the athlete deals that he's done and I liked it I wouldn't spoil it but I was actually probably in tears like I never thought I'd cry the end of like a nonfiction book but like I was like Jenny crying at the ending and Powerful about what it's like to be rich and I was thing as a very interesting things we'll talk about it because it's an aspect of the human experience that we took to some extent or another with like we all want to be rich and so getting an insight into what it's actually like to be rich from one of the world's richest man is very very interesting jokes about the Nike Sweatshop Scandal and how that kind of evolved and spread through other company like 10 years ago I think this was but it's it just overall like really really good oh Quicken Bill Gates a refreshingly honest reminder of what how to business success really looks like it's an amazing Tale enjoy and that is cool to DVI to buy Rolf Potts and in 2002 ages ago he wrote a book called vagabonding The Uncommon guide to long-term World Travel and in this book he talked about his journey of traveling the world and shows that actually this dream of World Travel is not as ridiculous and not as expensive and not as difficult as people by default would make it up to date so I read several years ago for example like long time will travel wasn't ready on the card but now now that in about a year's time I'm going to be free from the shackles of full-time employment and then I can come and do whatever I want I really like the idea of doing like a long-term World Travel trip alongside the medical stuff in various different countries so anyway where you get long phone conversation but the episode that I enjoyed other ones while he's interviewing other people who are listen to this travel thing so he did want episode where he interviewed some guy who travels around the world with absolutely nothing like a friend like his possible in his pocket and like his wallet he doesn't carry a bag or anything like that interviewed some woman who travels the world just with one back travel journalist travel writers Calistoga Fest it's it's so inspiring like it really gave me the bug for travel and everything. So I started listening to that I started actually trying to make concrete plans for my send me long time warp everything and listen to this podcast it seems a lot less daunting than it once did to me so if you run to the store traveling thing then deviate by Rolf Potts would highly recommend it's not just about travel deals to go off-topic and it was very interesting special hearing people who've done these cool things with allies then talking about you know any any old topic is this is going to be interesting to listen to it if you haven't already block quote get rich slowly and I'll crap name but it's actually one of my favorite personal finance blogs and there's a ton of really really good advice on get rich slowly about how to build your wealth about things like saving things like investing on a breaking these common myths about how investing in are in such a big deal and talkin about kind of low cost low effort ways to go about that but the blood pressure I want to talk about is called the psychology of passive barriers guest post so it was written by someone else on the blog and the person was written by I only found out like right at the Adolfo read this because I didn't realize I'm is it got cold Meat Safety SAT and ACT is quite famous among the community because he wrote a book called I will teach you to be rich ready ready ready terrible like clickbaity spanish-sounding title but it's actually a really good book kind of like 10 purses the 4-Hour workweek it sounds like an absolutely terrible title. Title but the continent is is really good anyway so this is a guest blog post back from like 2009 anyway after the old old is Link in the description below the whole block cuz basically about this idea of passive barriers and I like to refer to as friction I didn't come up with that idea. It's not anything particularly big or insurmountable that stops us from achieving our goals or from going to getting good habits of doing the things we want to do passive barriers that are in place so useful when it comes to the realm of personal finance it's about reducing used Arias like he talks about a story of some guy who they knew who had a check for like $3,000 and just never got around to cashing it and female the company sending the check went bankrupt so he lost $3,000 and it's just like such a such a pointless what's toys in this Papas and I found myself reflecting on my own life about all the various passive barriers that happened to be there in my life that stop me from doing the things that I want to do this when I leave YouTube videos and the process of oldest appointment we go to mark from their massive light their camera screen like the prices of setting this up at the store it took so long that this was like a big passive barrier to me actually being sitting down in forming a video where as I realize that if I can streamline if I can reduce the friction then it makes it a lot easier and more pleasant for me to sit down and turn a video and that just has good things in general by James Clear he talks about how if we want to build good habits we should make those habits so for example if you want to floss in about teeth thing and he was sick your flaws in front of the counter on your on your on your bathroom rather than inside the cabinet if you want to stop playing PlayStation so often we have to do is put the PlayStation the barrier it becomes some sort of friction that you have to overcome in order to then take it out again so this Blockbuster psychology of passing by us going to break this down a lot better detail that I'm currently doing and it was the main blog post that ready next with me in the month of June when I read it so you should get Elsa I'm going to give this away so if you want to if you want the book and you come this far in the video I'll come around bling and please comment anything down below and put your Instagram username thing but also would like some kind because then I'll know that you've actually watch the end of this video and I will take comments that have emojis on them cuz I'm curious like that YouTube retention girls show their only about like 10 15% of people watch the end of my videos what I will message one lucky winner and I'll spare your address on Instagram and you can get this copy of this book with little message Brandon the front from me like before my best I will pull up playlist over there that has all of my monthly favorites on them so you can just pick any of them are usually talk about a book a blockbuster podcast and physical product to buy"

            "text": " play friends welcome back to the channel if you need to hit my name is Ali I'm a doctor working in Cambridge and today we're going to be going to 35 my favorite iPad Pro apps and just your convenience of split them up into five categories and those are create consumed coordinate connects and syrup lost ones we had but I had to be 5 C's I'm a x x in the video description out of the pin come in so you can skip around as a feel like it but yeah let him get into it so we've got nine apps in the correct category and the create categories for kind of creation so for me that's mostly writing and photo related things in the first type on this list isn't Ross and Ross the Fantastic because he really great tool for quick capture so anytime I have a thoughts wherever I am I can open up the draft album any platforms iPad iPhone app immediately start writing it down but only when you open up draft to open up to a new note so you can just kind of stopped typing straight away and so for example of here I was taking some notes in the car this one into my Apple watch because I was I was driving and I can't type anything out or for example if I'm if I'm planning out like a a study with me video then I'll use dropped to type out all the things I'm doing throughout the day for the default Apple notes app doesn't have vacations Apple built-in next on the create list we have notion and I've made three videos about notion already told me about how I use it as my favorite productivity app how are use as a residence calendar and how I do my annual reviews using notion and I pretty much use notion to organize absolutely ever my life so like for example the video ideas that I've got I also use it to track my workouts at the gym so since the 23rd of September open tracking a look at the notion of going 19 times since then Gemini today I'm sorry I thought I was absolutely loads of otherwise I use notion for like studying for productivity and not so the stuff and I'm actually go a new series video could workflow where I take a deep dive into some of the ways that I used some of my favorite apps including notion an old videos in this world movies are available on nebula which is a new streaming platform that's built by a team of creators that I happen to be a part of it sort of like a playground wake races can experiment with different types of content without worrying about the YouTube algorithm so I've got like tons of apps on my iPad iPhone Mac and I want to deep-diving to oldie Niche nutty specifics of how I use them to maximize my productivity but that's sort of a kind of granular level of detail doesn't really work well on YouTube and so I put those videos in his work the series of nebula answer father a full videos on that and I'm going to be adding loads more of a Time so if your subscribers and if you like you can access them on my nebula profile but very few teamed up with curiositystream for sponsoring this video. His dream as you probably know is the ultimate documentary streaming subscription platform and because they support independent races what they've done is that you have a corrupted free membership for a free trial you automatically get free access to nebula so accuracy stream subscription is less than $3 a month and so for $3 a month you get access to this like huge library of eight documentaries on curiositystream which were amazing but also oldest independent stuff Black Friday to the nebula including some of the nice videos that I wouldn't necessarily put on YouTube the old Boomer of the app kind of ecosystem and that is Evan Evan has been around for years I've been using Evernote since like 2011 or something online ocean video saying the oh you know why haven't you replaced Evernote with notion I don't really see them as you no notion replacing Eva. departments like notebooks for everything I can think of and the way I think of ever know is that it's sort of like my long-term memory so what is nursing for us to things like product management and to do less than full project that are important but not urgent what Avenue is where I store a lot of the archives or highlights from books and articles that I've read all kind of random bits of writing that I've done because the writing about ever know is that you can just search for whatever you want protiviti for example I can just search my notes for the word productivity and now it immediately I will get all of the notes that I've ever saved since 2011 that have the word productivity in them or I can search more specific things or whatever what is the face traffic Bank of stuff like to act as a long-term memory that you can search through and the other apps like notion don't quite have those peaches yet who knows one day I might replace Evernote with one of these haunting you know taking apps but so far I haven't managed to do that just yet and I'm going to be like room research and stuff by suspect Emma is going to be a big part of my kind of second brain for quite a long time just I got so much stuff in their eyes really good and he's just such a very specific writing app that's available it's probably the most pleasurable experience before about this apple smart keyboard thing and how it's the nicest typing experience I've ever experienced writing Anubis easy nicest writing experience I've ever experienced and so sun rising like a long-form things like my weekly email newsletter then I usually open up USA's create a new thing I try to let using walk down so I can use #email issue 95 my weekly email newsletter if you like but you know I would I would use you to save them you know I'll be able to come by whenever I want in life quotes this is a quote and it's just like a really nice pleasurable mactan writings. So this is why I use for long-form writing which is still grey category started to use a bit less by still you sometimes and that is bear bear is sort of like a cross between draft and Ulysses and that is very good as like a general casual note taking app but it's also really writing experience so you know you can make a new note in Bear and just like with you to see if you can write and walk down and from there you can do things like publish to PDF for text documents or what documents are even published you would present ghost in them things I got and the times when I use bad mostly if I've got my phone or iPad handy and I want to take out of medium full notes on something that I'm listening to a podcast at the gym I might just open up there and laugh and then be like you know Tim Ferriss episode with Jim Rollins and then I will take a few notes on that I like how I've come across stuff and I would normally kind of reference a timestamp that I've heard that bit in the podcast I want to come back to Atlanta day I'll be able to see it but yeah amazing dictation feature so I feel like I might as well use dropped Optimus X is notability and notability is what I use for handwritten notes or the other note taking apps that I've been told me about are absolutely terrible like in that they don't have very good apple pencil support so if I'm in a lecture for gum like Alexa and has lots of evidence that can writing notes by hand is better for our attention and understanding of this of the subject than typing them out while we listen to like that then I will open up notability and I will do handwritten note so for example a senior exam so this was handwritten notes that I've made throughout medical school including kind of berries pasted this with the course I went over that was teaching us about neurology and how to do in Urological examination so it kind of photos of the course book put them into notability how to take them this you just caught me doing any other apps. Found I've tried using goodnotes I do have to have goodnotes installed but off of doing like extensive testing of both of them I decided that notability was better and I'm going to be making a more dedicated review about goodnotes vs notability so far I much prefer notability and I just I use it for all my handwriting needs 7th leave day 1 and day when is the best journaling app for iPad iOS and Mac I just like a journal so I have I have different units within they want to cut my actual Journal show you because that's private of mine I have like a journal of nice comments where I screenshot and you know copy and paste this was one of the videos I'm saying you cuz it was 421 of them so if I'm feeling sad I just kind of have a flick through my nice comments and then just kind of read some of them quite nice when you make videos you just kind of interacting with strangers across the internet mostly it's nice having like a place to put a nice thing nothing to have a memorabilia memorabilia Journal where I usually take photos of like birthday cards or letters or you know things things like that that I kind of want to throw away because I don't like eating paper around I picked up while watching like minimalism related videos because we all say that oh this this thing as a memory therefore they want to get rid of it but you kind of take a photo of it and then get rid of it saying that my photos photo album fungicidal in one place next we have Lightroom in Lightroom is the app that I use for all my photo editing needs when I'm posting photos to the gram so for example of what I was about to the other day but my iPad. This is a photo that I took on the ground but this is the edited version and this is the so I just applied like a preset to a did some Hue saturation adjustment. And Lightroom transforms standard photos into slightly nicer photo so this is before editing and this is editing it just kind of makes it pop a little bit more as do another example is when something like that a random selfie not tooken bed that look like this normally but my iPhone then I applied if you edit in Lightroom to it looks like this I think it's a little bit nicer on the ground and finally we have a really good app called sparkpost in this category and this is the app that I used to make all of my thumbnails so the great thing about this is that you can just add a photo and then you can just like new stuff around so if I wanted to change things with this thumbnail like I said eyeglass I could move this around like him cuz I can go sit up in the middle I might think the background is not dark enough so I can adjust the darkness of the background so it like this and this is just like a nice uniform way of making these thumbnails so those would be absolutely correct let's not talk about 7-Up Cindy consumed category so in the consumed category and that's for things like watching listening to and reading stuff to the first time in this great instapaper and instapaper is what I used to store articles want to read later so you know instapaper has like share extension to everything on iOS so if I'm what if I get link and I don't have time to read it there then I share it into paper to Tacony male Dratini most of his little ways of getting stuff into instapaper and is basically alive article that I'm going to read so that when I have a spare moment of time in the toilet or on the train or bus or whatever I usually like the first time but I go to usually instapaper and then I find nautical that I want to read and then I can read it and I don't see any kind of when does website stop I just see the article in this nice typography and the great thing about instapaper that you can highlight stuff antifragile planning and highlights the really cool thing is that when I highlight stuff it automatically gets things to ever notify a service code read wise and actually one of the episodes of workflow that Siri for the nebula talks about exactly how this whole thing works behind the scenes and the benefits that I found with exposing my all my info I like to Evernote and the various ways in which I use them so just remind if you want to hear more about this process and Wi-Fi useful you can check that video on nebula will tentatively if you could have curiositystream membership which you should because it's amazing and pretty cheap and just give you the documentary's if you have a curiosity when should you get free access to nebula as well so you can just find my Niche videos about this work. Well I'll explain all the stuff in much more detail but yeah instapaper is what I used to read self next we have the Kindle app is amazing because hot but for example if I'm reading a non-fiction book and want to take note so that I would usually open up in Kendall and then I'll have a split screen with dross you to seize or bear and so what I can do is that while reading and Kindle I can kind of take notes on the side the other great thing about the Kindle app is against go to highlight feature and I've been highlighting stuff on Kindle since like 2010 or 2008 when I first got a candle and another great thing about another video about how the Kindle read wise Evernote integration works with some examples of how I've used this export features can do highlights and wife out it immensely valuable to save all of my Kindle highlights Evernote so again get free access to nebula Link in the description when you can see these videos if you're interested in seeing me talk about the stuff in like really anal detail I have tried Apple music I Still subscribe to Apple music I think but you know I really tried hard I tried for about 6 months to switch exclusive Apple music I just couldn't do it and I went back to Spotify and it's just so nice glad beyond my most famous playlist at the study with me playlist with carne has 23700 followers and this is full of like a thousand instrumental tracks from like various sources classical music film music TV shows in a planet Earth all the stuff from Game of Thrones so when I'm studying then I put this on and none of these songs have any woods in them so they don't interfere with the word processing which can sometimes some some of the evidence says is not good when you trying to learn stuff but there was make stunning much more fun because I was liking it part of the Caribbean banging I found what I'm trying to say that about restricted geology music that we have an RSS feed reader app and that is cooled unread amazing and also I'm going to do a video about this on nebula just about how to set up a Sesame done like how to set up with Feedly and how to get into a nap and various use cases for RSS feeds but essentially RSS feeds on a how I keep up with all the blocks that I follow up and I sometimes get comments from people who read my weekly money's lesson Sunday Snippets do you know you've shed these three really good articles this week how did you come across this stuff like how do you keep up with the stuff I don't have time for a couple of days but now I'm saying it now it's all based on RSS feeds so you could have subscribed to different blogs and then ipsita more than one place 156 on read articles and so let's I want to read this article in the Journal of medical ethics but that's I don't quite have time so I can save it in the paper and So then whenever I want I can see we'll all the bugs Publix to pay out more on that in the workforce series of nebula which is going to be appearing later this month next we have curiositystream itself was sponsoring the world's best documentary streaming subscription platform Discovery Channel 1000 the documentary The Crossover genres some of the ones that I personally enjoy our about nutrition from get better at cooking and healthy eating themselves with a really good series of about nutrition that I've been watching recently independent creators that partnering up with us at nebula so if you subscribe to curiositystream you get free access to nebula so go to curiositystream.com Dalia check out and that will give you a free trial. You can sample the documentary to your heart's content and then scriptures light less than $3 a month which is totally worth it for these amazing documentaries on this amazing like independent content on nebula YouTube BF expert using recently previously I used to only read PDFs on notability because I'll be able to entertain them using the apple pencil but PDF works out like this structure of of the PDF so you can kind of skip around so for example in this Oxford Handbook of emergency medicine this like different bits of this and I can actually skip around to the different sections using sidebar where is if I was reading this PDF I would have to like scroll absolutely tons or use the search feature with things like that but yeah if I'm reading this truck to PDF like an ebook then I'll use PDF expert to that so in the coordinate series it's sort of like protiviti General utilities but it has top of the sea which is why is called coordinates what's up by about 2x so given that I spend so much time to email I'm more than happy to pay $30 a month to cut that time down by significant chunk and so these emails for example I can immediately just like get rid of them what makes it a bit more of a pleasure to get through email and so it just got to make sense out of a 2 is Fantastical calendar app of choice and then I think about fantastically natural language processing and that's the main reason why I use it so if I wanted to create an event I can say jam session with to Helen Catherine 18th July at 10 a.m. that sells house and what it's going to do is it going to recognize all the metadata and that I have created this event at 10 a.m. just make it so easy to put a vent into my calendar which means that I actually know you would come next in the coordinate category we have to do it to do it is what I used to manage my to-do list I used to use things in the video this time last year I was using things 3 but then I thought I'd try to do it the bitmo cross-platform it is available on Windows and like things are just kind of thought that you know why don't give this to go to be honest the apps but can't do the job for Phil's fulfill that purpose in todoist I keep track of everything I need to do but it's all of the usually kind of time-sensitive stuff that normally has some kind of a dead leprechaun paper to shopping list over the reminder to water the plants to call my grandma or that kind of cement coming to the bmj add stuff to my medicine e-portfolio and little things like that then I would put those into do it why is it Mega projects like an online course I like the video series and stuff that would go notion so use notion for big product management and I used to do is for little things and remind us to call my grandma and to water the plants and to publish the podcast an email newsletter on Sunday how to get water the plants I should have done it yesterday so it's a reminder for me to water the plants next we have YT studio and then I think about this is. It shows all the comments across all my videos in chronological order so one thing I like to do is reply to any specific questions if I can you come and see if I go sometime and so I'm on the toilet whatever I do have time to reply to stuff instead of using you to be actually I use the YouTube studio app that's me to reply to people and stuff it also lets me kind of changed like descriptions of videos update thumbnails stop answers General Quinault to have the YouTube creator for more apps on this tablet through first Google Drive that I used to basically my my entire life is stored on Google Drive to everything is in that frame to oil which is a good video collaboration platform sofa if my other question everything video he uploaded to frame to ir and then I can like comment on the different time stamps in the video and so we can kind of collaborate and will be at it should look like ultimately the app zero that are used for accounting business Dashlane which is my password manager of choice again. Going to show you any of my parts within that but yeah GIF app Cindy coordinate has agreed to help me coordinate my life keep my life together be organized be productive all that good stuff all right we have for apps in the Connex category that allows me to connect to other people in the most important one that I use everyday is slack and I'm I'm I'm probably few different slack groups this one is cold to ride with a blow dryer that I follow called kehe I think that's how you pronounce his name this is really nice like slack group where everyone he kind of follows him as part of this group you know entrepreneurship money productivity books Financial Independence TWP stuff like that and people just very friendly and recommendations Forte Labs like group is another blog that I follow and has the courts building a second brain that I took a few months ago I also standard which of the agencies and then there's the team of people that help me out with my stuff so nobody used to chat with Christian my editor but it does other people helping out with writing content and doing other stuff that's helped me out when they go into the A-Team slack channels he has a team have already figured out proper name for it that's what I smell next p.m. Discord a few weeks ago I setup a Discord server and so far we've got 259 people online and I think like five turn this over in total loss to help with the homework and studying is reactive group of podcast books protiviti Tech what we discussed all this kind of stuff again description if you want to join the Discord it's free and now I just hang out there sometimes if I'm pretty bored and like you know what I don't want to make a video today I'm just going to school and reply to some people so this is how I like to hear chat with people so into a real-time on Discord I want to make more use of it when I go actual time off work so maybe kind of use it and gaming haven't quite decided yet but yeah I told her I know Ice is very wholesome definitely join the community on Discord next just quickly the app that use for Twitter is tweakbox nothing exciting here at the Twitter app the app that I use for messages is Apple iMessages I'm over three messages synced across iPhone Apple watch Mac iPad Etc and it's probably one of the main reasons why I don't use any pan on Apple products just because it's so convenient when you can reply to text on your laptop or your iPad or your phone depending on what device you have brother having to always type out stuff on your phone which is what I would have to do if I was using Android phone and finally at the end of the video sex apps that I use for studying and learning stuff and I have to call this Thoroughbred because that's what thinking and it's also the sea so now we going 5 c's for this video I hope you guys appreciate the effort that takes to make up stuff like this when I'm feeling like I want to come and get an injection of knowledge into my head skillshare which is a platform for online classes again baseball videos 3 hours and 15 minutes long so if you want to become a YouTuber and edit videos like this one you can check out my course on skillshare if you like next we have Anki which is my flashcard app of choice thank you is what I used books read medical school to learn drugs and an ass man also the stuff what are using Anki to help prepare for my postgraduate medical exams I'll be doing much more videos about that in-depth probably on workflow first that's reasonably well-to-do well all kind of distilled limited YouTube videos in a few months time that's the plan basically like let you get chords for any song in the world so let's say I want to play on The Fearless by Taylor Swift quotes for it so it would it would give me the lyrics to me too chords if I'm playing a piano or guitar I can be like the street looks when it's just right there's a glow about the pay whatever ultimately it's great and yeah you can't play anything in the world if you just have the codes for it and you can sing along its fantastic I'll show you some of my notes in ocean wave God's let's see where we humming physiology of homeostasis example essays within the database that are related to the topic of nerves I've got active recall questions that I began go in the ocean and I bet Adidas have all the notes listen for the topic

more about the stuff I actually talked about it in a livestream that I didn't the official notion office hours and actually wings from that are available as part of the workflow series on nebula so

            "text": " talking about this whole desk setup situation here that I'm going to be using for youtubing studying General productivity stuff so I'm going to be talking about how I put it all together the rationale behind choosing the various things are Link in the description below to all of the various products along with timestamps didn't like the trio lamp or whatever then you can just skip ahead in the description from Ikea but on the other side we've got the Alex drawer unit the Avanti countertop means that you can pretty much get a desk as long as you want difficulties in different sizes you can cut them down to size how many Alex drawer unit one side or both sides like some people have memes looks like it got this like custom built desk so that was the desk let's not talk about the chair and this is a random mugging to make office chair that belongs to my housemate already wanted to get the heavy metal and body because it looks absolutely sick but when I mentioned the price tag to my mom she completely vetoed the idea of me even though I know I'll get it with my own money and that it was good for the back and all this other stuff but she just was not having assholes all right now that's about the tech power in this whole setup is the 15 inch MacBook Pro I went to the 1 terabyte hard drive upgrade is connected to be so touchy USB aluminium Hub thing to this LG 34in ultrawide monitor this is a pretty budget ultrawide monitor as far as they go I think it was in the region of about 300 lb how to over a thousand pounds fast if you want a 4K display or a 5k display or 38-inch ultra-wide what you currently have feels like like you feel genuine pain when you when you use it on dead load research that shows actually if you want to increase your happiness by sending money then the only way to do that ready is by removing Stadium negatives pipe thing is covering up a power cable in the HDMI cable and I think it looks it looks quite cool you can't really see it from a distance and if you do it so it looks like it's kind of the monetarist closing the other side I've got the Logitech MX Master this is the standard Tech YouTuber Mouse and I actually. Combining the mouse with the trackpad editing in Final Cut I use the swipe through the timeline how cool I can feel my love come on Central in back of my chair for the mouth and one has attracted to the other I just feels it feels like a nice experience to edit videos on using the original Apple wireless Bluetooth keyboard which I bought in like 2009 from friend of mine I literally been using it these last nine years mother's back is absolutely incredible on the desk I would like to have my old 2015 retina MacBook Pro this thing is still great I take it to work these days cuz I'm not overly worried if something bad happens to it but it still works amazingly. anything I want to do the computer other than hardcore video editing that sounds weird it's because I'm using at the moment and have been for the last three years of these basic Kubota Tech 25 lb once I go if I let you go to write and you do the subwoofer underneath I kind of do want to upgrade to Addison 300 speakers YouTubers use the atom alter speakers or like some Audio Technica ones those look really cool and like the glossy white looks pretty nice but again I see no reason to upgrade these I'm not an audio file when it comes to my speakers and these are cheap and work very well on let me down right so intensive lamps I'll go to at the moment one of them on that side is the Cossack anglepoise lamp and then on this side we got this new common Scandinavian Eastover design Pixar lamp looking thing fuses in his videos about the double lamp but I do quite like the Warm Glow that it gets to the whole room especially if I'm editing at night it just makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside these two Japanese from Japan when I went there about 6 is it go now I have to update my Spotify to a desk underneath the desk one of those headphone stand things that you just stick to the underside of the desk I don't want side of those I've got my Audio Technica m50x used for audio editing telescope and like NHS lanyard and like Bluetooth headphones are take to work let's not talk about fake Ikea record purchasing for anyone who wants to be a tech YouTuber literally everyone has these this is great recently I decided to add a treat the desk setup this is the pachira tree which is like an indoor tree that's apparently quite used to the cops are so if you're interested in adding little bit of flat to your desk setup or to your house in general you might want to consider become almost the centerpiece of of the whole room because she's so nice somewhere on my desk so I've been practicing class at Magic now for about eight years wow that's a long time so if I'm kind of doing something that doesn't require these my hands are like just kind of grabbed the Deccan Rock things that you just drill into the underside of the desk and that stores all the cables and then for the most part when you wherever you're in the room you can't really see any cables I still think there's room for improvement but this does the job for now thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribe to the Channel please consider doing so I've now started working as a doctor so I make blocks about what life is a doctorate like but I'm also kind of making a few Tech videos about apps that I use for activity . I'll put some moldings in the description below"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him on his belly and the final year medical student at Cambridge University for the two people got might not know who you are can you give us a quick my time had being I just was every one of them think I'm blowing here and everywhere else if you check them out if you are one of the two or three people maybe studied psychology I Did It For My 30-year you're doing famous whole degree in the field of psychology about effective study techniques and all that so I'm going to be doing a series on this channel in-depth in a few weeks time but this is going to be like a broad brush PBS has like Signs and autism Humanity side on the side side side anyone this on this way I don't even have like that read it for a ticket that's why I did text book that's like read this text and the Texas school I text a chimera text me 6060 because you get to be like on two calls I like abstract I always leave something like this topic is so important because the future cyclone I think this applies to GCC and it'll exams as well when I was doing it we'd like to the most games and it would say that you got the highest mark supposed to stain document I eat where you say what you're going to say any deduction and then you sustained Leon Hewitt throughout as opposed to the sound a thing of introduction and then four against four against and then in your conclusion you like wait for the conclusion before telling the reader what what your thesis is what you look like I think it's really good to stay too in advance and I'll just cover this and like 2nd in this essay I will argue about adding spider diagrams where you have your beautiful pic in the middle and then he just give you a broad broad brushstrokes overview I just got to do it sometime essays like how do you remember how do you memorize the ice off right so how do you have eyes for exam essays are exams what we had to do each essay in an hour am I talk to this Witch of ensuring that everyone talks to me how do I how to get festive in Psychology Quizlet Medical why did was I made about 50 at a time and I predicted what possible essay titles they could feasibly off based on the lecture notes on the subject and I committed or $50 I said time to memory by just doing spotted background over and over again and each has a plan had like seven references references I just write a review paper that reference reference in the night in a memorized 1942 did a study where blah blah blah in my head and then hope the 12s as we have to do eight of them will already prepared and the other fool because I already because I had all these other attic fans of my head is going to drag and drop them in like a spider to spider diagram in just like this. In the time of what was going to be in there tactic of doing spotted diagram of the space reputation that's not absolutely magical technique that is the secret weapon of all everyone to reply all these efficient study techniques and then you come back to it like a week later you realize you forgot next week I would just kind of planned Brute Forces by repeating repeating repeating but what they've done and it's like you forget to write like if you are coming today you'll probably forget it mostly about tomorrow but if you revisit it tomorrow then you get back up again and then it takes you longer to forget it if you do it again a week later it takes you maybe a month to forget it I made a spreadsheet of like my topics and then I'll be like I'm doing this one of these ones and a one and then the next day I would repeat those and then I would say a week late from their repeat that is another month later I'm going to get those am I doing this I had about three months left until the exams which is kind of what we have now until edibles this kind of timetable where you activities fate your reputation out I think that's that's like the main the main reason psychology where I think I was I was able to be like whatever question you gave me this year but you saw some more than 10 to 15 and that covered the bases of at least three questions show me what the what the hell and I have like contraction conclusion in the next little while it's in between I feel like the reason why she wasn't because the other magic weapon of all these official study basically it means testing yourself in a low stakes fashion like Jesus I just tried to bring it in Ivory to contacts everyday discussion with with medicine stuff with my friends live while we're eating lunch or something we one of us would just throw Cashin Out There and usually depending on the crowd like some people like a whole lot Madison active recall rain percent certain things you can do from some guy whose name I used to know for my for my exam Fox from within the brain is far more important than the putting of that fact into the brain when you try and recall facts from your brain that is a lot more efficient than 20 for the back in and I think a long time ago we do when we were writing programs that we read and then we re-read re-read Again by University students to read this passage of text and answer questions about it that's the one group of them to read it once and then answer the questions for another group and then also questions and for the final group they go them to read it once and then just fine think of answers to questions does active recall it obviously the read once group did the West the read four times did II was the Mind map proved it a bit better the four times reading but the final group that just read it once and try to recall this fact they did the best sir this study kind of showed that just trying to test yourself in a little State fashion is 4 times more efficient than just then just be repeating the same thing over and over again that I do with my friends who Alexis inspecting the school days he used to say stuff like I would take me 3 hours to get through a scientific it's cuz all they're doing is repeating I think it's all about like making question for yourself and testing yourself I've never once by to study now I agree because I feel like active recall thank you very much I've been ready tips on stick to what you know is good for you and use that I like the evidence-based behind all these things for me I study this in 2nd and 3rd gear and I found that when I understood what the evidence was behind it and stuff like you nobody should listen to music while studying and whether it is good to highlight in notes commensals rok-us music with lyrics is is what otherwise I should hopefully have given you Authority for Aviv station active Rico lesson plans thanks so much city jobs without a degree"

            "text": " set the most important thing that I do every year is my annual review video I'm going to take you through the three important steps of that reflect step to plan and step 3 execute I'm going to introduce you to my famous patented pantywaist man set the three main reasons why I think doing an annual review is to me best thing ever and why are recommended for everyone it's really useful for setting goals will want to set these New Year's resolutions will 12021 to be better than 20/20 for various reasons I think doing an annual review first step to setting effective goals for the new year annual review time just go slower like a so much stuff that's happened in 2020 this year that I just completely forgot to send through during my annual review process over a few hours it actually reminds me of a I've done this year and that I'm experiencing that I'm grateful for which I think most of us we were so focused on like the day today and like the urgent things that we have to do it a life that I think having an annual review having that one time of year where may I take a step back and take stock of My Life as a whole and ask myself important big question it's nice having that space to do that and those other three reasons why I love being an annual review let's talk about my annual review system now and Stefan reflect step to plan and step 3 execute and I'm going to give you a quick review of all these different steps so unsurprisingly I'm using notion for my annual review you don't have to use notion if you don't want to but it's free and it's great under the very cloudy sponsoring the video which is all some of the oldest wanted my 2019 annual review video so this is a nice like full circle thing and if I speak list template my annual review template with some of my own says LinkedIn the video description so if you like this and you want to copy it for your own ending review then hit the link in the description you can download the template you can duplicate it into your own work space or if you just don't want to questions into what app or pen and paper or whatever you want to use full here on annual review through the process. One is reflect and we got four sections and reflect we've got the stuff I'm grateful for cool stuff I discovered this year and then various reflective questions know the stuff that I'm grateful for I like to spit up into five parts as people experience his accomplishments things and game-changers this is Betty auditory categorisation but helpful Honda people this year I've separated out into three different categories work-life and Associates anomia write the name of the president and then write a few what about why I'm grateful for that present in my life then actually usually when I do this it reminds me to send that person of Elsa email or thank you text message was just something like that to let them know that I'm thinking of them and I'm grateful for them and that always makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside next we have experiences that I'm grateful for your experiences in 2020 these are some of the experiences that I've been particularly grateful for then we have accomplishments and I'm grateful for and here are some of mine usually I'm not a fan of thinking too much about accomplishments but I feel like once a year I give myself license to just actually think about it a little bit electrolyte usually in my life when I going to do something I just don't really appreciate it and don't think about it and it was like on to the next thing so once a year I give myself permission next we have things usually like physical products and stuff that I'm grateful for. in my life so my awesome desk setup video about that coming soon will the Apple product to use on the regular and I should play nice having a PS5 a little while of course my airport Pros usually I have a long list of things I'm grateful for here and then the final thing is game changes so things that really move the needle to me and so the three that I've got here are listening to audiobooks at speed multiples I discovered that in 2020 coaches of a lot of coaches for little different thing than actually today I started my amazing team of people who work with me on this YouTube channel in on the business that's having a team has been an absolute game-changer in terms of me know who is kind of making these videos and helping build a business that doesn't think about what happened this year like January and June of 2020 I forgot most of it and so what I do is that I kind of right off the top of my head like a big picture of what's going on in my life but then I was like to have this timeline view I'll just go through my calendar every month and then just talk about ended and just write down interesting or noteworthy or highlight what it's like anyting any experience that happened that I maybe want to remember and so you know this stuff on here so yeah it's a way of spaced repetition reminding myself when I've done that year next we have cool stuff that I discovered this year so I'm at a discount to be working with people because I've worked with lots of coaches this was the year when I realize even more people makes everything more fun oldies various teacher at tennis lessons as well we're going to add to the list we have physical stuff which is a bit of an overlap with a grateful thing but using new stuff that I discovered this year was the first day the power of using face towels previously I used to Facebook my boss Howell which I've heard is now a bad thing to do so face towels having a water bottle with a straw powering this whole desktop like a pretty much never unplug it because it would require too much effort but now I have an actual laptop and I use the Mac Mini on my desk enough in a real game-changer Flex their list of articles podcast books and YouTube channel that I discovered this year than I find Sticky memorable this is very easy because every week I send an email cold Sunday Snippets wear on Sundays I send an email to my Lincoln figure description and every Sunday I send an email with a few thoughts about just stuff I've been thinking about that week but then I also have links to interesting articles or f*** off or books or YouTube videos or anything like that that I've discovered that week and so when I do my own you think about what were the interesting things I discovered I just look through my email newsletter Sunday Snippets archive and then I had to pick a few because that gives me an interesting mental model or a change the way that I think then often I actually forget where it came from and I forget that I didn't know about the thing until I read a blog post and then the following day someone will say something and I'll be like about about this thing and I just wouldn't appreciate the position I was in before the idea and do I find that when I go through this list every year of the Articles and the videos everyday remind me to oh yeah I didn't know about this thing until I read this blog post from Ryan holiday with his blood pressure Morgan house with this business review naked people who are driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to under invest in their families and over invest in their careers even though intimate and loving relationship to the families of the most powerful and injuring source of happiness. all the stuff in the notion Tempe Diablos if you want to check out these articles to find them there as well we got like a handful of thing like 10 of them that I picked enjoy this year those books Elsa have a video about the 15 favorite books of 2017 that will be linked up there somewhere right now and a few different I really enjoyed this year so binging with babish yes yes. If you've all videos Tom Scott then we have the reflective questions that this is something that I've newly done this year as I see my assistant who can I send me the list of questions saying that you should also these for your review Sentara feel free to do some of them feel free to order them if you like I sent a lot of these out to my music and a little people replied saying that these were just very helpful and helping them get more clarity about where they want to go this year and also in life so you know one of these if you had to teach one thing you love the Sierra what would it be and I talked about power accountability and other one is what keeps you up at night with excitement this year and I talked about my court-appointed Major Academy and also kind of this old building a team stuff that I've been I've been ready mix how do you have fun differently in 2029 talked about kind of how video gaming has been a source of joy in my life especially listening to audiobooks while playing video games that is like absolute pure pleasure you do want to have a little bit more of a gander in a bit more detail but now let's move on to step two with his plan now this is where we make a plan for the new year and there's a few visualization exercises that you can do I'm not very good at I know it's something that I need to make time for and I'm planning to do it at some point but one is called the ideal ordinary week which is that five years from now you write you write down in great detail what your ideal ordinary week looks like so ideal this is like a good week for you and ordinary and that it's a week where you're just doing normal stuff you're not like on vacation or something I need to take the time to do this 5 years from now audio ordinary week. Give us a way of figuring out okay what do I need to be doing for the next few years to get to this 5-year vision and then we come to audio ordinary week for this time next year for example like I said I'm not very good with these visualizations because nothing very far ahead and be maybe in the future but what you doing what you working on something that might help me is that you really want to be really really really specifically describing these things and a lot of us have this idea of I want to do the same but more of it until we meet examples oh well we're doing this year right left YouTube videos a week next year and that's a very easy truck to pull into and so when we find yourself thinking in that kind of way of the same but more the ready one question. I also like the most important thing to come out of this is actually what are you doing what are you doing in this Vision what is longer priority and then why you still doing nothing right now then off of the visualization exercises we have a few different areas so the ones that I have our life medicine and business because I like the three aspects of my life I was in life we go help relationships happiness what's up I just write some general thoughts about what I might want to do about all of these things next year and then I'll come to setting for both of them later on so funny you know I kind of want to do workouts three times a week I want to have regular tennis sessions I want to join but I would have some kind of daily mobility and stretching routine because I know that will probably be good for my life and good for my posture on the relationships front I want to take dating more seriously post-op down and be more intentional keeping in touch with friends and then under happiness refusal to let me come to my favorite part of the annual review and that is writing out the bucket list of the last year but usually arrive from scratch and then I look at the 2020 list or the day before and see is there anything here that I forgot it but usually if I forgot to write it down if usually because that thing is no longer necessarily a priority for me and so I've got this like bucket list of 20 items of which seven I have put on the this is the stuff that I want to do in 2021 and the rest of it is like Sunday made maybe kind of long-term but it's stuff that I don't want in this Saturday activity focus on in 2021 so on my list then control busking singing underground at some point next year and then snowboard the few items on my 2021 bucket list just like a useful exercise to do because anytime I want a bit of inspiration or I'm thinking of you know I don't know what to do in my life okay yeah I can make some Headway towards kind of working to adolescence fun and this is where I talk about my auntie Wasteland system now this is a little bit involved but all the questions in the stable again LinkedIn the video description template questions to and the reason we have step 3 execute is because it's very easy like an annual review to just Joy have it as an exercise in introspection and reflection which is fine but I am also a big fan of execution rather than just reflection and so this section is here to make me stop being a waste Man actually making progress to what stuff and some questions to the first one is dreamlike what is the dream and likes me the difference between a dream and a goal is that a dream is like emotionally resonant and my mate with radicals that's a valuable which is something like learn to draw would be a dream but if I kind of make make that even more specific learn to draw like a concept artist cuz I'm really into concept house why do I want to do the thing and it's really important to have a very strong why behind the things that we going to do because if we don't the idea of illustrating scenes from my favorite fantasy books it's good content left learning new skills is always fun thing is that we are going to convert this into a smart goal smart stands for specific measurable achievable realistic and time-bound and so how do we make this more specifics. end up in 21 I'll have Illustrated a scene from Wheel of Time or mistborn or Stormlight Archive which out three of my favorite fantasy series upload a speed painting of it to YouTube maybe as a short to YouTube and Instagram so that is like a very specific smart Goldust at myself that is very easy for me to know how the skull is a bit vague but it's important to have that because that's like you know the emotionally resonant dream or if this is the more like specific goal this is a good question then and this question is how surprised would I be if I failed and I'm the number on a scale of 1 to 10 scale of 1 to 10 how surprised would I be if I actually didn't end up doing this thing but this time next year so I can actually think about it would I be surprised if I did not speed painting inspiration type thing I wouldn't be surprised realistically I know myself and this feels like you know I've wanted to learn to draw for a while but I've never done it and so my surprise that they would be a 2 out of 10 that I E not very surprised if I did next question is what it what are your top three reasons why you might fail at doing the thing on this take something about this take some introspection some actually let self-awareness to figure out why you're going to be a voicemail about thing so for me my top three reasons for that I don't practice enough that's not an easy number two that's too technically difficult number 3. What are not knowing how to actually that's what the roadmap towards becoming a concept off. So this is probably the main one on the list what's up two questions which is spicy food can help me achieve this goal and secondly How Can I stack the deck in my favor to succeed from the same question but I think who comes first because often when it comes to achieving our goals it's about who knows I thought you were a good book I read recently by Geico been horny and then Sullivan about how well how would like actual success from high performance is always based around who can you enlist to join your team to help you with this thing rather than How can I nothing to it myself and sometimes of who can help actually even like having our teacher maybe remote resume our lessons and to find online courses where someone speaking in think I think funny naughty with Mike McLaughlin I think also potentially for the Arts thing having an accountability buddy and unaccountability is everybody is like usually a friend who hold you accountable for doing the thing so for example my brother is my accountability buddy make a pledge to each other that every day he's going to spend 15 minutes doing improvisational practice on the piano and I'm going to spend 15 minutes doing drawing and if we don't on any day we have to give the other person a hundred pounds when we do a weekly podcast Lincoln video description if you know if you don't subscribe to know everything and then how can I stack the deck in my favor so one of my favorite techniques of this is time looking making space on my calendar for our practice so for example what I should want to do is I should create a recurring calendar event on my calendar we're at at around 5 maybe like 11:45 a.m. for 15 minutes I have on my calendar Duarte remind me to do the thing or 6 or something because I recognize that not knowing what the roadmap would be in becoming a good artist is going to stop me from doing it and therefore then that will give me the road map and that would make sense and I've also identified that was like my second reason for failing at this would be that this concept nothing is too technically difficult but really that's not a valid reason because all I have to do is reduce my I'm supposed to be a video of me doing the concept art painting anyway like at the very least I will know that I have made progress but this time next year if I just do it and not worry about whether it's good or not so another that is the way I can stack the deck in my favor and now this is the most important one on the list which is that take action right now so what is the action step that you're going to do right now when you're doing annual review that will help you go on that pump and I did a couple of days ago and so what I did was I signed up to an online art course and figure drawing on proko.com I think and I posted it on Instagram to kind of have some accountability and could have just fun to see how cracked my drawings were but then some baby shots Me by Instagram DM who is himself a concept artist and said that he would he would love to Mentor me in and Bambi my art teacher that was six we have chat on Instagram that day and he's not my teacher in this morning at 8 in the morning I had my very first online his profile his name is Alessandra is right and what time to do our lessons three times a week and 7n. Mentor teacher would have happened if I hadn't just taken do my auntie wipe my system and take action right now and it's actively think about why might I fail at doing this thing but I claim to want one of the reasons I might come back that and then you can help me do it and do it right now in fact tempat doing jest Jester sketching this was of a reference image of the reference image here if you want to have a look and see how bad this is this was my second attempt this was my third attempt how about you got to leave this is my holding a gun this was my attempt to do another kind of gesture and so now this is like Dave three of my art Journey Only happened because I took the time to do this execution step in the annual review pencils is I actually didn't have any pencils in the house and a DLC over here I started doing the scheduling I started going through the gesture sketching course just using a fineliner pen because I didn't have any pencils Bible defensive Amazon Prime but instead of waiting for them to arrive once I have the equipment then I can get started I realize that no I did a dangerous way to think and it's never true tell you can just take out your phone and fill the video like I did rather than a way to get the best camera equipment because we all struggle with this thing where we feel like we need equipment to get stocked with doing stuff which is almost never the case anyway let me check out this very short playlist I've made specially for you over here with just three of my videos themed around reflecting on the year so that's my favorite books it is my 20 Life Lessons by Legends and it's also my New Year's resolutions goals for 2021 happy New Year I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " friends welcome back to the channel in about nine different ways that you can make passive income if each of those I'm going to talk about how hard it is to get started how hot is to make $100 a month from it and how hard it is to maintain once you've created the thing in the first place for me and my business different sources generate around $27,000 per week these days with varying degrees of passiveness and obviously this is taking me like eight years to build up so don't expect to be hitting those with the numbers when he first started I would have had when I started my Jenny many many years ago let's go for a passive income I always act quote it because there was really no such thing as passive income there is no way to make money without doing anything at all but what I say passive income what I mean is that it's money that is not directly tied to what time let's say you were to write a book if you write a book you publish a book that book is now and bookshelves you've done the work kind of wants to write and publish the book but now anytime the book sells you make money from royalties that is passive income you can literally be making money while you sleep because this thing which is out in the world which is generating income for you always takes a very long time to get going so if you see any ads before this video talking about how you can get rich quick by whatever scheme or if you see people in the comments pretending to be me saying you're so you can get rich quick with crypto WhatsApp this number that is all this, it's not going to work there is no way to get rich quick it is not a thing so if you're looking for a get-rich-quick scheme of things that don't exist so you might as well not even try and do I think of this is that ultimately money is just a medium exchanging value the only way to make money is to provide value and the only way to make passive income passive money is to provide value in a way that is not directly tied to your time so please please do not try and get rich quick scheme they don't exist I've had lots of messages over the years from people who have try setting up to a get-rich-quick crypto scheme or a gambling scheme or a hey here is how you going to play poker online none of these things ever work people always end up losing money the only way to make money is by providing value on so let's talk about the nine different ways that you could provide. I want to tell you that I've just launched my brand new still check laws about productivity for Creative how to start a successful side hustle that's Link in the description skills for a sponsoring this video will tell you more about it later on but I want to plug my own class because and it will help you get tips on how you can start side hustle in your spare time let's get into the video and is an Awakening a form of value and so when we give our money to a company in the form of buying the stocks it makes sense that we would get some kind of return for that investment and was telling me this because investing in stock is the easiest way to make any kind of passive income if you have the savings and they're sitting in a savings account earning 0.01% interest then already doing very much for you if you had this day savings and put them in stocks you could potentially be running passive income from the money that's otherwise just sitting there going to be late other there somewhere so that is a solid half an hour. Option to stop exactly how they work but the thing that I recommend for most to get us as a non financial advisor steal my money that's in stocks and shares is invested in index funds not Index Fund is something like the S&P 500 and when you invest $1,000 in the S&P 500 u.s. so you waited by how big they are so like you know 2% of it would be an apple 2% in Facebook 2% in Google to Poseidon Microsoft and then you probably want to go to the 500 company on the list but basically all the big us companies you end up investing in a little bit of time so if you want you can use webull I think of gold link in the description if you're in the UK you can use free trade or Vanguard country ranges Google the phrase best stock broker platform fuel pump relay manual fi what's the UN is very easy to be able to invest in an index fund so it wouldn't all famous side hustle assessment Matrix we going to give the difficulty of starting a 1-star rating 1 out of 5 is very very easy to get started with stock how hard is it to make $100 a month investing in stocks do this kind of depends because it depends on the performance of the stock market over also in the last 12 months from 2020 to 2021 the S&P 500 actually increased by about 50% that is a 50% everything going on so if in April 2020 you had invested $2,400 in the S&P 500 by 50% means you would have made $100 a month. what time. You looking at but if we average on the Loft study 250 years the S&P 500 has had a roughly ten point something percent return with mean every year on average over the long-term and goes up by around 10% this is no inflation adjusted for any equipment back-of-the-envelope calculations if we want to add a hundred dollars a month passively through stocks and shares we would need around about $12,000 invested in the S&P 500 to make that 10% 1200 if you put in $7,500 in the S&P 500 and you left it there for five years and five years later you would be making roughly $100 a month if we go by this very average figure of 10% a year if you invested $5,000 making $100 a month in purely passive income again assuming the 10% average so overall how hot is it really to make $100 a month in passive income from stocks depends on how hard is it for you to make 5000 7500 $12,000 in savings and put them into a Index Fund this is money that you shouldn't need to touch in the next 5 to 10 years at least so basically how easy is it for you to The Miz make money comedian average salaries run about $50,000 something like that but give this roughly a 3 out of 5 star rating for difficulty of getting $100 a month if you live in a country where the average salary is $3,600 a year and very very difficult to make $10,000 in savings overall once you set up in the first place I'm going to give this a one-star out of five because once you got the money and you just like set it and forget it and it's not that hard to maintain there are other sources of passive income that require High degrees of Maintenance of a time but stocks and shares is a very very easy make passive income example these days my stocks and shares portfolio which I've been investing in since 2015 is now worth around about $350,000 and the majority of that is in the S&P 500 Index Fund a very very rough average of 10% a year then that averages out to around $682 per week in purely passive income Academy Bank in the video description where I teach people how to do this whole thing so let's use of side hustle assessment Matrix and we'll talk about this how hard is it to start a YouTube channel well I'm going to get this one out of five stars because it's actually very very easy to youtube.com you could create a channel you going to play videos for this building with your phone and uploading it harder to make good videos and making good videos of how you grow on YouTube but getting started on YouTube is very very very sprinkle with the real question is how hard is it to actually make real money from YouTube again let's say we want $100 a month in passive income to be eligible for monetization on YouTube you need a thousand subscribers and 4000 hours what time it took me six months and 52 videos to get my first 1000 subscribers on average 90 something videos to get to a thousand subscribers so that's quite hard if you're thinking you're going to get there to be able to do this for a very long. Of time at least once a week I say for at least two years before you can expect anything in return but that's how you hit your time how hard is it to actually make $100 a month thousand views on YouTube is running about $2 so this very massively but let's say on average about $2 per thousand views before if you want $100 a month you need 50,000 views on YouTube to make $100 a month I mean every video you make needs to get around about 12,500 views on very roughly the average YouTube channel can expect around about 20% of that subscribers to equal the average view count for each video on YouTube if you had 62,000 subscribers averagely you can expect 20% of 12500 views on each video and it's evening you have no Evergreen content of the longtime you need a ride about 60,000 subscribers to be making $100 a month 10000 something subscribers like it was it was very early on but when it comes to assessing how hard it is to do I'm going to give this a 4 out of 5 Stars it's actually very hard to make a compelling YouTube videos and it's very easy to get started but it's hard to do well the great skill sets refund you get to meet people across the internet you got to learn how to talk to a camera and how to film and video editor but it's very hard to actually make money from YouTube go to thousand subscribers and what's your channel is growing it means you've landed on a formula that works and so maintaining it then becomes easier than starting from scratch and maintenance of a YouTube channel passive income stream to be right about 2 out of 5 stars sample I made 70 videos before I started making any money from YouTube AdSense these days the YouTube channel makes around about $12,000 a month in passive income from YouTube AdSense now again this is because I keep on uploading videos but actually the bulk of the amount of generate from ads is from older videos rather than videos that are open that were updated this month so with that caveat $12,000 a month passive income $3,000 a week stop but it doesn't really count as passive income through YouTube which is why I know including this in this cost of cells don't really have a algorithm that's helping them grow and find a little podcast grow by having a YouTube channel which is kind of how hot is it you can park your phone around between you and your friends and you can start a podcast you can use web cycle Riverside do I found that I recently invested in as an angel investor Riverside makes it very easy to record remote podcast interviews is very very easy $100 a month in passive income from the podcast this is not quite passive income because the way podcast is make money is by relying on brand deals there is no YouTube AdSense for podcast and so you need a sponsorship for a brand deal to make any money for your podcast and apparently you can expect to make around $18 for a 30-second and $25 per thousand a thousand reasons for a 60-second at that level of sponsorship deal you would need around a thousand downloads per episode if you have a weekly podcast so you have $4,000 a month and if you're putting a 60-second ad in there for $25 per thousand views that would make you run about $100 a month four episodes, how hard is it to get a thousand downloads per month it's a lot harder to get a thousand podcast downloads per month then it has to get a thousand YouTube views per month because it's different soul solo on YouTube but if it starts then it's the top 20% of podcast in the world that get on average more than $1,000 per episode please A friend of mine as an example my house magazine started her own podcast around 5 months ago there will be a link to that in the description and on average baskets round about 400 to 500 downloads per episode this is not bad at all especially considering she started 5 months ago and had a zero audience when she started so she didn't have the unfair advantage that I did when starting my own podcast for example news about it on YouTube that will really help the podcast bro and I'm pretty sure that in the next six months she'll be silly getting to a point where she can quite easily make $100 a month from her podcast 3 out of 5 stars because it's hard but not as hard as Maybe monetizing on YouTube or you have this minimum threshold and funding maintenance well it's not really passive income because you do have to keep on making podcast episodes because the brain deals were associated with that but again once you stop once you know how to be a podcaster it's easier to continue going once you've already consulted as is the case with most things and sometimes of Maintenance of the podcast I'm going to give that to stawski me and my brother have a podcast about $625 per week from the podcast overall from brandiland from a membership to become an affiliate marketer means that you are selling other people's products but you're getting a percentage of sales from 48% of affiliate marketers globally on $20,000 a year which is $1,660 a month. At all like people doing very well with affiliate marketing a role so how hard is it to get started with affiliate marketing basically you can just sign up to an affiliate program like Amazon Associates so Amazon have their own affiliate program which I think is probably the biggest in the world and then once you have your little special links you can post those on your website or Twitter or and social media or whatever and if people buy the product through your on sight by any product on Amazon floor-length you'll get like some tiny percentage of the sales so pretty easy to get stuff but how hard is it to make $100 a month I'll be pretty good I wasn't nearly as much as 5% off is like two or three percent conversion rates are a people visiting the Thing versus people actually buying the product of a physical thing that's a that's a 1% you would need 8000 Google website or whatever to make $100 a month Authority and whatever space you're in got your serve organic taking in traffic a few other affiliate programs that I'm part of that one of them is skillshare who you can get $7 in affiliate commission just but I think so if you wanted to make $100 a month or Affiliates you need 15 people every month to sign up for skill share with your affiliate link saying how hard is it to get 15 people a month to sign up with your audience if you have your own puzzle still try like I do have like nine of them and so if I want to make money through skillshare affiliates play so somebody will say that description and then that will be needing some affiliate income from skillshare for this video five star we will talk about on this channel the way you build an audience is bike racing useful content putting it for free on the internet once a week I'm doing this for at least 2 years if you just follow the three steps I guarantee Freddy's 2 years so we'll give that a 3.5 Star Racing but once you start making money from Affiliates and I should quite easy to maintain because especially if you have Evergreen content the sword that isn't reliable at current affairs of the latest news that people might search for over long. this becomes like River has to be reasonable passive income. If we look at me and my business these days from skillshare we make run about $11,000 per month in affiliate income which approximates around $2,750 per week about $450 a month from the Amazon UK store and a little bit more from the US and Canada or a download or an app I got you crazy at once and then you can send it multiple times because selling digital products doesn't usually have any cost associated with it a few months ago and ended up making I think like $300,000 in the course of like a few weeks just because of the people around the world wanted to buy his icon pack so he put the work into creating the pack and now he's sending it. Who has made he says $700,000 from selling his website Tumblr themes since 2014 so you made the website themes for Tumblr sells them they make $700,000 on average over Olson since 2014 that's pretty cool I mean anyone can write an e-book what counts as a digital product so I'm going to give this a to start writing 2 out of 5 stars but I will say again money is an exchange of value so the thing that you're setting you have to be providing enough value to compensate it to make up for the price and that's often quite hard especially if you don't have any experience in this sort of failed to how hard is it to make $100 a month but it's a whole different ballgame trying to get people to actually go by your icon settle by your Apple buy a website because the market around this stuff is so competitive like you have to be genuinely really good to get people to buy your stuff and the way you get people to pay you money for something is that you identify a problem that they have you solved that problem in any charge money for it and if you can do those three things then you know I would say that easy to make $100 a month but it's very doable to make $100 a month just genuinely have to have something that solves a pain point the other people willing to pay for so we're going to give this a 3 out of 5 stars to make $100 a month selling digital products and finally take two out of five stars because usually you do have to maintain your product a little bit but it's often easier to do like it's much easier to maintain a productive than creating a product online course online courses are in video format in fact this whole video so long it could basically been entire online course I need to know how to do video so you could fill it online course on your iPhone or Android phone on the side Pope to the phone case something again and don't get a reason people pay for it is it the course is actually good you can avoid having to charge for your online courses by using a website like skillshare Emma 2019 just released my new Online files called productivity for creators how to start a successful side hustle where I teach you the ins and outs of how you can create your own side Hustle Lincoln's video description will get 30% off the annual skillshare premium membership does I should really good deal I pay Pesco Sarah I've been paying for it for years even after I start teaching on it because it's genuinely a fantastic place I'd like the nine that I've got there are three around productivity now like the fundamentals of productivity that should have plenty of equation which is how I think of productivity and productivity I have to and how you can study for exams if you're in school if you got any good play people really had a free trial if you'll share then you can still use that offer that if you wanted the first a thousand people to hit the bank and video description you'll get 30% of the premium membership you can check out my costume is pretty good because you can teach things on skillshare without directly having to charge for them which is why I love putting my clothes and it's kind of like having something on Netflix and not have to pay directly for the product anyone can upload a coffee filter provided it needs certain quality requirements and so it's a lot easier than having to make your own website and create your own courses platform and all that kind of stuff so pretty easy to make $100 a month from teaching online courses depends if you're going down the skill share rooms then to make $100 a month on skillshare you need to run about 1700 minutes of watch time which is 28 hours of watchtime so if you have a 1 hour coffin skillshare you need 28 students to take that cloth every month and watch it roughly very broadly speaking and that will give you round about $100 a month at least at the base of my fingers over the last like 2 years of being on skillshare is very easy to get 28 people watching it because people already know like and trust you hopefully and so they'll wash yourself and give you a short because you've already built at Goodwill with them for the night again that I think about Coach are the top form is that they have like their own algorithm so the goods Risin to the top if you genuinely have a really really really good clothes and you put it on skillshare then even if you don't have an audience there is still a high chance of it because it actually good and people watch a lot of people recommend and give a high ratings able to rise to the top and it will start getting recommended to people skillshare homepage / search for a specific charge $100 for a course and then if you do that you just need one sale every month so how hard is it to get one person a month to buy a course well again if it's good more and more money is being spent on online education specially with all pandemic stuff but if you have a valuable skill that you can teach I think horses are one of the best and easiest easiest one of the best ways of making passive income because it's fun to create course you can teach stuff you don't need that many technical it's like making a website or anything like that just shoveling snow share and then people can take your course and then on the internet and like you know it's just cool overall and the nice thing is that once you made the course and once you're making $100 a month permit maintaining that level is actually quite easy to out of 5 stars because generally you don't need to update Aquos that often and you can do that once in a while and you just need to make sure you're getting a reasonable amount of traffic to it and hopefully that traffic will grow over time these days round about 60,000 to $65,000 per month in purely passive income like I literally do nothing for myself eyeglasses on that made them other than replace comments and that's like $60,000 a month in passive income dollars per week and this makes up the bulk of the $27,000 a week that this business card degenerates in purely passive income or Community model again this is generally a bad idea unless you have it audience like everything becomes easier when you have an existing Audience by creating content that has been valuable over a long. Of time very consistent. Williams nose likes trust you and so when you say hi to my patreon then some people are likely to do that thing the other way of doing it's like raising a value proposition that is so compelling that people would be willing to pay for a community like service fullest if we use patreon as an example my friend Hannah witton who's the YouTuber she's got round about 600,000 subscribers in YouTube I think she has around 600 626 last time I check which means she's making somewhere between 2000 and 5000 lb or like 3,000 $7,000 per month in passive income from this audience but it's like 600 people out notice of 600 the one in a thousand of us subscribers have signed up to a patreon so pretty you know if those dots are true across the board and they kind of or if you look at my develop picture on as well you need a big audience to make a significant amount of money for patreon again to sort of depend on how much exactly what value of a paid membership is my friend and Lord who runs a website called Nest labs and they have a paid membership Community which is $5 a month and she started this and he just wrote a hundred blog post over a hundred working days and built up an audience that's that in March 2020 when she launched a membership she had some paying members for initially and I think last month she just passed $100,000 a year in annual recurring Revenue which is pretty from something that started less than 2 years ago so how easy is it to start a membership program that you very easy with this a one-star because on some kind of membership what about you to do that for me know once you're making $100 a month and that's a lot easier to maintain it because the way the membership communities work is provided you keep showing up and providing value you know people have already signed up for the thing so it's not too hard to maintain that level of support that you're referring them to this business we have a membership Community for a part-time YouTuber Academy for the alumni we make roughly 2,800. from the membership Community if we run like three or four events per week along with like twice a day co-working events of zoom and we have lots of stuff going on so about $2,800 a week is pretty good for a membership Lancome is creating a business that sells goods or services and then automating or delegating aspects of that business so that the income that you generate from it is reasonably cuz if this is about in the 4-Hour Work week weather a little businesses that you can make Goodwill selling a service and then you can delegate out so it was made and intelligent ways to make income passive so again using my friend all your as an example on his YouTube channel he talks about his $1000000 Shopify store he designs manufactures and sells these really cool vegan leather clip desk accessories and bags and mouse pads and that kind of stuff and this was loaded work in setting up but now he's got a team of three other people that manage the business and so he spends proportionately less of his time running that business and so it's sort of passive income for him even though these days he still does spend around the week maintaining things equal if you're going down the service road to I'm a better friend who runs Instagram and Facebook ads marketing agency where he has clients who pay him some of that I think a few hundred dollars per month to manage that Facebook and Instagram but then it's sort of automated and he's got a Miranda and he's using things like that. To automate aspect of that business so that each month he has to do a very small amount of actual work to keep it ticking along to be the different ways of generating passive income from a kind of goods service-based business starts with the stuff to get started we going to give this a 4 to 5 star rating because the guy you need to create a business and it quite hard to make a business that genuinely provide value you have to be able to provide body and he was hot like it's not as easy as making an account of stuff platform two things money and you actually have to give out he's people with it than anything maintenance annoying for generating passive income is to build an app or website was some kind of software product that you can offer either as a one-off or more likely these days as a subscription service and there's a whole category this costs a software-as-a-service website packers.com Dairy like literally hundreds of examples of people who have built software businesses that are making passive income and they share the revenue numbers and they tell you how they go Startin to give you the tips in fact I was recently interviewed on an episode of the Indie hackers podcast which is really cool cuz I've been listening to and I was interviewed around the concept of something online course like the part-time user experience when I was at University I made a website called B Master ninja and you Cape Cod ninja so it was a question bank for medical applicants applying to medical school to help them do well in the admissions test and this was something that me and my brother coated completely from scratch and I both know how to code we were young and so he works over the summer of 2015 to make these things happen ending in year one we met $10,000 in India five last year it was around $25,000 from FEMA and dresser it's pretty good money but it was a lot of work to set these things up I have to actually build it takes a lot of work and it's very hot but it's a little different kettle of fish so we're going to give that. As for the nice thing is like with everything maintenance is little bit easier so we're going to give that a 3-star rating videos that I've made around tips for entrepreneurs how I go started creating my business is with the code for the stuff that's only play thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in this video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to channel 18 you hear my name is Ali Ahmed final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is the second installment in the monthly favorite series where each month I talked about like books articles podcast interesting things I've discovered for that month that I want to share with you guys to the response to lost one favorite video it was pretty crazy people syntaxity nice for me to see that even when it's just me talking about random stuff that has nothing to do with medicine the people still watching cuz I sometimes get out of the boat Advance into other things I'm interested in other than just fixing a medicine my same old boring scrubs anyway talking about my favorite new music thing which is the soundtrack from the greatest showman incredible film that would highly recommend fact that I like using involving Google drive but it's kind of can generally be applied to the life so I think you might find that useful and finally having to be told me about a book called crushing it by Gary vaynerchuk lessons for entrepreneurs people for like YouTubers and stuff in that that I want to share with you guys I think those lessons can be applied to life generally as well so yeah and now let's talk about which is my favorite new soundtrack so yeah if you haven't heard of the greatest showman it's a film starring Hugh Jack and Zac Efron as basically about this guy called PT Barnum who I think created the original circuses that he brings into the people that were shunned by Society freaks they were labeled and showcases our amazing telling his story and how this is going to come into being Listen to I link them on my Spotify download my favorite songs off Wesley this is me which is like the main song of the whole thing I really like rewrite the Stars which is like one of those classic love songs how much is cold from now on and asking about the climax of a Million Dreams. So those full songs the songs that I've been kind of listening to on repeat in the car at the gym wherever I go in my house has been really annoying people I live with Torrance often singing along enough to do video some point we're supposed to cover up those if you'd like to see that or if you don't like it covers of popular songs into this side of helping people Bad Medicine thing but I still really like the whole thing a music thing and that's a big part of my life so I'm kind of at the moment unsure as to whether it's in a sensible to share on the YouTube channel who would be probably a bit too much specialist Outlook and Delta would you still maybe watch the videos if it's me and my friends actually singing I'm concerned that people would install unsubscribing Casino what they signed up for full was the medicine content and what sometimes getting is random covers of Justin Bieber's hot film is very good as well it wasn't that critically appraised I think I got like six points on the line TV and that's what makes it is so predictable. Like amazing but as far as okay number to I want to talk about when you find Stacy reason I discovered cool to the kingkiller chronicle so in the last video talked about how I love the mistborn trilogy The kingkiller Chronicles are hard to tell how long a book is a lot longer to get through the book and listen to the audiobook of the second one while I'm taking placement that's cool to the Name of the Wind and then I started the second one but then decided to exclusively listen to an audiobook duration of this particular audiobook The kingkiller Chronicles it's done very well the guy does very good voice as well as like II audiobook lost about like 40 hours something and I'm 6 hours into it so like each time I go to the gym I kind of look forward to going to the gym because it means I can listen to me how to convince myself note to just blister on Kindle like reading it only because I like I like having this this crutch that gets me to the gym because otherwise I motivational technique that I found where I can make myself at the gym which encouraged me to go to the gym more stop with the mistborn series Foster paste Sophia kingkiller Chronicles would recommend Link in the description for this month is a little productivity the backup in storage off on the Mac recently-released update where you can if you if you have filed within Google Drive and you want to share them with someone you can right-click them from within finder and I'm mentioning this because this is part of a wider productivity hack that I use that I think is one of the reasons why people think I can do a lot of things in a small amount of time because most of those things involve using a computer is that I really do everything to minimize the time between me thinking that I want to do something to come over and get that and that thing being done so good about this on my personal blog, yeah I know it's not having your own personal website you can read more about it if you if you're into this little thing would you do Q hit come on spacebar and you talking about I opened up or if you want to search something on Google you think someone's baseball and just type whatever you want or if you want to open it while you come on spacebar had an extra space and then type in the name of the file to open a file 60 are I'd go on projects I go on roller College of Obstetrics and Gynecology is post another one I picked on the PowerPoint I double take Ativan it'll take about 10 to 15 seconds to do with using Alfred keyboard search function I can just come on spacebar type in booster and it would know that the latest post ripen was the PowerPoint file he enter and within about two seconds of seconds in between NPA Auction Company is the PowerPoint file overtime and I've noticed that when I'm watching a little my friends who aren't as into computer Zion as naughty as I am using a computer I Marvel at how slow they're getting through everything because there is organ system start menu file desktop whatever navigating so much time if they Embrace this whole keyboard people singing this from a program you should be using this all the time and then once I finally switched to using the keyboard shortcuts these keyboard keyboard navigation Rosen navigation it really increase my productivity what we do in life we do you know whether it's University work or school work out or anything and we'll be using computer safe we can maximize our productivity or not we are increasing or efficiency of a roll and then we can either get more done in a given amount of time but we can get it done quicker yeah that's one of my biggest productivity tricks three of this this month favorite thing about is a book called crushing it by Gary vaynerchuk CEO of a company a social media company called vaynermedia importance of setting up a personal brand whatever feel Nubian and then you kind of build this brand Up Overtime by providing people that like really good useful content and then people know you as an extra and then a further down the line you for example want to write a book and sell it you got this audience of people that already know you've got really good working that would be happy to pay 7 lb for a book that you that you've written in this book stories from people who basically people who started by using the power of the personal I want to share the first one relates to effectively not being afraid to make mistakes as far as being afraid of making mistakes makes everything easy for me he is quoting someone who's stories in this being unafraid of making mistakes makes everything easy for me think freeze you up to do things and doing things allows you to win or learn from your loss which means you went all the way hear me now you're better off being wrong 10 times and being right three times then you are if you try only three times and always get it right self-help for the doctor almost Toyota term things that we all kind of know to be true and find stories of people applying them and that's that's what he's done in this book crushing it I will know that it's it's it's okay it's okay to fail in that making mistakes of kind of a good things even from those mistakes I think the more we internalize this the most success we can have in life and I've already noticed this within within medicine often when when we're in lectures or orange or whatever and and a lecturer doctor Los Acosta question speak up and what they said was there they're afraid of getting it wrong they don't want to do Canadian from their peers they don't want to talk to sensor to think about this kind of stuff and what I've read about quite a lot in is that it's very important to have this growth mindset where what is growth mindset has more on the lines of DLCs were part of the process Improvement in everything everything can be learnt and if you know if I don't have it then even from the way I phrased it and quite true to be the growth mindset is probably objectively better than having a fixed mindset because it means you more open to learning it means you're from your own personal self-esteem being hit by 5 cicadas at this point about not being afraid to make mistakes is really good one I'm in the context of this guy's and think about why I started this into the camera that YouTube cuz kind of with YouTube on my very first I thought it was best top-loading you really have to not really care what people think because you're sitting there talking to camera running around holding GorillaPod in public that was one of my friends going to think other people are going to think I'm a narcissistic prick for you know having the audacity to tell now that I've done it I'm really glad to have done it and even if the child doesn't get any bigger even if this is the best I still had at least 50 messages from various students thank thank you and I are very lucky videos really have to remind me that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been afraid to make mistakes and afraid if I'd been afraid to kind of put myself out there in French the world of coronavirus sounds but yeah that's my little motivational quote of the day I never once said that was something that I picked up in this book and Irene fourth of May example you're making a video and you feel the pressure to create something good and a lot of times people and cuz I'd not good enough to it to make this particular thing and we put the whole pressure on creating creating content creating a story and get stuff done is that instead of creating think of it as just documenting you just documenting your life or your documenting the things that you currently know you're documenting your process of learning something so for example if I'm doing a vlog about a day in the life when GP placement which is coming up soon I'm just documenting I'm not creating content of a create an interesting story and this this kind of months have documentation this really takes the pressure off it makes it easier to means yoga people because poor shitload of boring content into the miasma of boring content already living on YouTube because if if you try it and it goes well then he tells loads of stories with people who done the same and they've built their personal Brands and it's going to be well for them and if they've been able to quit their boring corporate jobs to do something like medicine do most people but I think if you want then it's good to be friends I'm not good enough what I'm doing is copying this other artists make some the sales of those he didn't start it and that's that's a really good thing that he does he puts his online he shares his work with the world even though he still thinks inside the good in me might be a bit crap the sharing thing is is generally really good to do another really good book. Show your work put your stuff online if you would like to be a writer put your work online and you know just have to have this thing have this out of backlog of content that you designed overtime the whole point of having this isn't that it's useful in this very moment but it will be useful 5-10 years from now if and when you do make it big and people see the oh well this post has been rising by the token for the last 10 years as well that's really awesome even if no one long-time thing and all I'm doing is is documenting the process of learning and I want to be documenting my did my journey as you need doctor joke. Metamodernism Alex didn't quite a bit completely free of charge is books are almost free because they like books and you can get a free library in fact you make the point that you can repair who buys but cannot find it hard to turn PDF of if you like really cares about is is sharing content because he has long game of building Brandon and helping people out and I find that quite inspirational thing someone off the other day who my Inspirations are I think Gary Vee is definitely one of them in terms of this whole chair useful content with the world and an end and at some point down the line maybe you can you can sell the books then we'll talk I want to talk about and that is crushing it by Gary vaynerchuk watching you like the video please give the thumbs-up I do that just to summarize you told about number one what do we talk about"

            "text": " aprons welcome back to the channel can you hear my name is Ali Ahmad up to base in the UK think about it which is how to type of my superpowers in life and I think any can become at least twice as productive if you just improve your typing speed and so this video going to talk about the benefits of improving a typing speed and then I'm going to go of eight actionable practical tips on how you can only improve your typing speed so that you can become a productivity quit smoking around 155 words per minute on a good day I'm feeling physically sluggish I will be hovering around 140 words per minute Mark for contacts the average typing speeds around 45 words per minute and if you watching this video you know I'd like me videos of probably significantly higher you go you need to be around 80 words per minute to qualify as a professional typist whatever that means regardless of whether you want to be first and most important one is that it just really impressive people like when people see me typing at work in a book at the doctor in case you didn't know the single biggest compliment I've ever gotten two years of being a doctor but still it's nice to hear and everyone goes through would you interact with a computer if you can get the computer to respond to you kind of s close to you thinking that thing as possible then you just like so much more productive in front of the computer those are just in general in terms of interaction with a web browser website and sending messages to friends all of that stuff becomes quicker and therefore we become more productive when we can type faster because when you're writing something like whether the first drop for blog post or a project or an essay or a script for a video when you're writing something the first drop should always be just kind of a brain dump without really stopping to think about it too much and so when I'm planning videos over postal email newsletters like I can almost type at the rate that I think and therefore I just get stuff onto a page so much quicker YouTube channel blog music podcast how do you have time to do all this stuff while you working as a doctor and my answer is well I'm taking a break the medicine right now I think it's being able to make such a big difference because it'll make life so much better so that's why we should be improving the typing speed I've actually work to improve mine and it's had a big effect on my life and hopefully one day it will help me attract a mate simple ways you can improve your typing space part so Stefan involves learning some keyboard shortcuts for fixing mistakes and if you don't know these already these are an absolute game-changer so I'm going to type some stuff and I'll show you how I fix mistake okay I'll talk to you somewhere over the rainbow wall up so when the right way up the old school way of fixing this mistake is going back back back back by space it's like using backspace multiple times previous hopping is that whenever you find yourself using backspace more than twice is probably a better way of doing it I'm so if I take that type it back what I'm going to do is I'm going to use option and backspace and what that does is that. Delete an entire word option backspace to delete an entire word and I will show you on a Moto G keyboard with that looks like again option and backspace to delete the entire world and this is absolutely revolutionary If instead you one of those heathens that uses windows and don't worry you can also do some windows you press Ctrl + backspace and windows that work and that deletes a whole word but I just changed the game of piggy because now you're pressing backspace multiple times to delete mistakes you're doing option backspace or Ctrl backspace and then you more efficiently fixing mistakes as you go along which is on Mac but not Windows Faith to delete an entire line This is helpful in fewer circumstances and being able to do to delete individual words but that's also an important enough semi-regularly doing typing test on this website when I was I think 13 years old I'm 26 now like the eighth grade was about 70 Woods come in at maybe eight to it was between 70 and 80 was Mexico still in at that point but you know just a few times a month I'll just hope one to ten fast fingers and do some practice do one of these puppies pee test I just opened improved exponentially improved linearly based on practicing the test so let's do one now and I'll show you real time then we'll see. okay City 65 words per minute and then just for once a week for about 10 minutes he's been practicing contest and it's typing speed now is up to run about 95 so that's about a 50% increased by practicing 10 minutes here and there for the last few months so it's very difficult to get quite quick at typing when you doing these tests somewhat regular day cyclic EBR which is like a typing lesson type website I don't spend a lot of time on this personally I mostly prefer to use pen for thing is but this is quinine it's trains your typing speed based on what your own weaknesses are so let's switch keyboard back to English lessons keyset and a select few keys I'm currently Izzy and so I'll just do a little bit of it first and I'll show you how it works so over that my speed was 104.281 hour this is my school whatever but the point is is. It's it's worked out as soon as he was just texting me Ani ni TRL now going to test me on S and a few other keys so so you're 75 and so what it's doing is it is that as I'm typing it's figuring out which specific letters on the keyboard on struggling with and then it's going to train me on those more often and so this is other frustrating because all of the ones that is making you type out on Equity real word and that's why I prefer 10fastfingers for is general practice and also testing myself because it's actual words and I think 10fastfingers is based on like the 300 most common real world test and practice of typing speed what's like he Bo. Come is good for getting those little bits that are a little bit more pesquisa I occasionally have will double with this General digital productivity productivity away from using Mouse using the keyboard flops to be everything so on Mac the app that I like to use the Disqus Alfred which is sort of a replacement to Spotlight and so I don't even I don't even show my dog I like never ever look at my doctors open up apps instead of what is Alfred come on Spaceball and I'll just open the app Safari on Spotify or just go I will never ever used this this screen to select apps I will almost never use the mouse to drago versus to the doctor ticket and that just makes me so much more productive on a computer because now I something and then immediately happens with the app Alfredo if I want to do a Google search Christian Diaz. Whatever you type in if it's not a nap or such time for like a fight or something it will automatically search Google for it and so you can Google things very quickly if I want to sell something on Amazon and it will ultimately it'll it'll recognize in front of start Amazon and Saudis date today things that I'm doing I'm doing well quicker because of Alfred but alongside my typing speed is improving because now I'm so interesting the keyboard for everything I'm doing on the computer rather than using a mouse to click and so even if I'm using any kind of new app anytime I find myself having to use the mouse I think in my head okay this is the Baltimore and I will Google what the keyboard shortcuts are for that particular app so that I can cut the keyboard shortcuts as I go sing to this keyboard first mentality which I did in the roundabout 2012-2013 that's really helped improve my typing speed keyboard Warrior keyboard typing is that you are able to type whatever you want without looking at the keyboard and I think it's very tempting to look at the keyboard initially but I think the way to train them is by going slower but not looking at the keyboard and less frequently make a mistake anybody have to because what we're training is already training or ability to see why the keys are and hit them with paying our bility to know see where the keys are and hit them and so my talking speed was slower I used to give myself the ability to look at the keyboard when I need it to you but now I kind of forced myself now I'm not allowed to look at the keyboard and I will always try and have correct mistakes even without looking at the keyboard because correcting mistakes is an important part of improving Cinema 6 is that we always want to be returning a fingers to the resting position of asdfjkl; and this is very easy to do because the most basic the old keyboards the F and the J keys are going to have these little bits on them and so index fingers of left and right hand can always return to this position I think this is just a generally it's kind of like the Jakey from wherever you all the people 1007 is a little bit weird and try to make noise so I'm not sure how to get this is why I devices in terms of like a professional typist when I'm typing loudly identified Foster and if it's like a quiet room or lecture or something and I'm trying not to make noise then I end up typing a lot slower and loudly as I can in a way out of it at least for me it helps me get into the mindset of typing typing harder possibly I'm going to be inefficient because in theory any excess force is wasted Force but I find that yeah it what what I'm trying to be loud we always want to be freezing and proving a typing speed kind of like game and we always want to be improving like for me I know the next stage of my Improvement as a typist confront a hit 200 I think 200 what's the minute would be a good good thing same. my left pinky more often with the ASDF method what you're supposed to do is you supposed to use your pinkies headachy the QP the 1/2 and shift but radio only thing I use my pinky Forest hit the shift key and I will use my left ring finger forehead you know qaz one too so yeah I'm basically I've reserved my pinky just for shift and that's why people say even though onset East 140 in this section 157 today I'm still trying to improve and I kind of treated as a bit of a game I think that's one of the most important things that like it's a skill that can be improved and my life has improved answer key to Cricket like a game improvement and then you two will type like a protiviti grease monkey because well I mean apart from trying to attract a spouse with talking Foster because we want to be more productive as a sudden start the video being more productive isn't just about how fast you can kind of like for the keys on the keyboard Peyton is electrical it is protiviti equally useful output divided by time multiplied by the fun facts at and if you want to learn more about my own types of productivity you should definitely check out my productivity Asian joke about a mental model of the pilot the plane in the engineer which is how I like to think about productivity and we talked about the three minutes the three powers under the three laws of productivity I think so far about 10,000 people of taking that cloth and it's amazing reviews free hit the link below to get a free 2-month trial of skillshare Wauconda sponsoring this video because I have full confidence how to edit videos exactly like this one so I signed up to a two month free products you can watch hours and hours and hours of the rest of my consent if that's what you want and you should definitely check out is ultimately is more about trying to make a cell's more productive than just you know the mechanical task of improving a typing stop all for less than $10 a month for the annual premium subscription even though they sponsor my videos even though I'm still shy teacher I still pay the $10 a month every month and it's one of the most worthwhile things I spend any amount of money on the inside definitely hit a link in the description to get a 2 month free trial of Steel video If you like this video"

I completely agree with this point about it like it's it's not even an option does it is not a choice it's not like I could publish video if I feel like it it's a I have to publish a video every Thursday just like I don't I don't decide what I feel like doing I decide what I need to do right now and I completely agree with that I don't have this idea of oh I don't feel like doing something if it's on my to-do list I need to get done then I'm just going to go to my desk and do it and I don't even consider the I actually rather take a nap or watch a video you just it just has to happen questions from Gavin vasandani says what inspired you to make YouTube videos so when I first got accepted to medical school it was after I had done an undergraduate degree in Toronto after I'd already affected by for medical schools in 2013 when I first applied I'm so I felt like during this four-year time span I had learned so much about the application process and what it takes or what is what our people are looking for to get into medical school so I decide let me share this information so I made a Reddit ask-me-anything and I said hey nobody replied I did the same thing on the student room Forum nobody replied but okay fine I'll take all this content and I'll put into a video that's what I did on my goal was to help 10 people get accepted to medical school when I helped them people talking to you I was going to stop doing YouTube videos but then obviously important to a lot more and I really really enjoyed it but kept on going altruistic and stuff if you would ask me why why why YouTube the honest answer would have to be that I saw a business opportunity I saw a way to promote the courses I was running I saw way to make money online on you that YouTubers will make it work with making it big and I love you famous ultimately I could do more interesting things because the bigger your audience in the more you have the more it just unlocks various opportunities in your life for me very much. It out as an entirely selfish I slay the most until I tell people I think that's completely the fact that you already had these businesses that would benefit from having an audience to promote to that makes perfect sense and I don't think there's anything wrong with starting a YouTube channel with the intention of making money or grinder what are the time I honestly just that I've been editing videos for a long time before that about like my vacation is like playing basketball or any silly stupid thing here are there if you want a good question I think but you enjoyed it to make a video about this thing. Ortonville jobs but that's not me but I stick to wear as I wouldn't necessarily but I'm expressing myself so altruistic selfish. rml tgr 2405 what do you feel when you watch each other's videos on YouTube okay so when I first started making YouTube videos I obviously look the other people's YouTube videos in medical school I think the big screen at the continent is one of the biggest craters if not the biggest now so I've been watching these videos ever since I started making videos and I got a lot of tips for productivity in workflow from you like notion with Introducing Me by you I used to listen 1.5 * speed but after you opened it out like a k I need to do on everything it's like Justified it for me to do it on YouTube videos as well and you are one of the very few on both my personal YouTube account on my YouTube channel YouTube account that makes sense I supposed to my head like adding anytime I want anyone's YouTube videos I'm usually not watching it for the content I'm usually watching it for the metal around it like a free completed like a really good book and I felt like that was a better than one that I've ever put together and so like that I could have said something came here cuz and there is like a real feeling that I don't know like a new kid on the block with his coming out well that means it's just a line of reasoning that is what inspires me about watching quote smaller YouTubers. Okay what can I learn from this to make my I was looking at Yosemite video I got a lot of inspiration tips from your videos watch mother people's like editing techniques even how they talk what footage they include what they don't the framing of the camera on everything so I definitely find Value in that in sort of take seeing what I can add to my own videos to make them better as well Thanks James who says other any regrets you guys have throughout medical school don't talk after medical school off a times where I have accidentally or on purpose then to someone in some way like there been a few instances where black accidentally said I said something that I didn't realize would kind of have repercussions but just kind of regret I have about my life ever from the fact that I didn't take more notes when reading books when I was younger my biggest regret is in in first year I was so obsessed with making sure that I wrote notes on every single aspect of every single lecture that I came across and I ended up spending so much time in my first you're sitting in the library taking these notes when I could've been doing a meeting could have started this YouTube channel a whole year early could have been socializing more hang out more excetera and started looking back I know I didn't need to put in that much time and effort or I could have done something in a more efficient way. Something I would let me change going waiting for this to come between us yes. I'm always so that's something I've taken from you and I'm trying to do more and more and a video on evidence-based thing on why is it where I can see why is the worst way to learn but somehow I feel like it's the best way for me to get that information just like write it down and see it and read it and so that's why I'm still stuck in this take a note I get anxiety from doing Anki that you know for example there's no contacts in there for your eyes USMLE stuff I've been looking into Anki and every time I do an accusation I think I know exactly where to come to the flash card called is like I could tell you when it sprays in that context what microscopic polyangiitis does but if you ask me in real life what did Marx I have no way of integrating those 18 V calzone to form a coherent picture when I have to make if I can get into one page then it's position on the page and its color and the stuff around it connecting two different parts and it's easy to remember location location on color is like so underrated in in note taking what are your strengths management tips so I think for me by far the biggest thing I do to relieve stress exercise is the best thing I can possibly do clears my head makes me have a mental reset just only make me feel better when I sit back down to go studying and I wouldn't change that for anything else what does stress mean General sense of the word stress I feel like I don't really feel that stress generally but sometimes there's so many things going on that you feel overwhelmed and you kind of need like a reset and sort of cleaning your head going for a run going to the gym or just doing something else helps you know commuting to work an hour each way I'd have like 2 hours of listening to fix an audio books in the car and so when I get home I wouldn't need any down time or relaxation time because I've had that 2 hours in the day in the car listening to for example last night I was feeling stressed yeah eliminate stress stress is gone but I feel like maybe people who deal with stress no more emotional way than a practical way sort of my own Australis thought that all right next to have a question which isn't really a question but it's a big thing during the holidays in that you and I get a lot of emails Instagram DM has tweets from people looking to us to ask for advice and types of questions at a far more likely to get a response than others I just wanted to about 200,000 subscribers I was replying to every single comment on every email that I got and then it got to the point where I realized I was on some sort of the same questions over and over again and a lot of those questions have been answered already in previous videos of mine or someone else is more knowledgeable than me on the topic anyone else on YouTube so generally questions for me that I'm more likely to respond to are very specific and they're about to know something that's a big that can be put into Google so if I receive an email where there's a question that could just as easily be answered by Sir Google then I'm very unlikely to respond to it every now and again I'll get a question about a specific situation somebody's in where they looking for advice and I'll respond to that on my email especially from sitting on my desk already with my email open what about you I got way too many emails from people who for some reason think of it more efficient to ask me if you ask me something like what are the grade requirements going to Cambridge medicine what am I supposed to know about it and I get why people are asking I get that it's probably a thing of well in the in the shoes of the other person weather getting like two hundred emails a day from people asking questions and you actually want to respond so you could figure out a way of writing a person is already making one life one thing that always that I would find helps is that structuring it in a very specific fashion so kind of making it obvious for the question is because often and I'm sure you get this as well end up being like two or three paragraphs stream-of-consciousness at the end it says yeah I just want to know your thoughts on it where is the people who give three paragraphs on the 12th they say the question should I take biology or should I take chemistry how to do here is what I think you would say given you a given what I know if you want any videos I'm very succinct and I'm very strict with what it is that I want to say to them the subject is very clear like one single titled encompasses the whole email and then it's like hello this is exactly what I need best regards thank you I feel like I'm more likely chatteris straight to the point and yeah email me don't follow that template at the point when I was responding responding to all of my emails it would take me like 2 hours of the day like you know that's a lot of time to dedicate to the responding to different questions play but you got to make it easy when are you two doing a cloud with an Oscar Oliver waiting, he was supposed to come over today but he had to work in fatso IEHP why you both interested in during residency in the USA? American flag emoji and scared face doing residency in the USA I've made it on Hoffner video about this if I do residency training in the UK I will salute intrinsically be limiting the amount of people I can come into contact with the new people I can meet the adventure that our house because I've been in the UK up in anambra state is like training in the UK take me to going to be much of a challenge as I feel like moving across the world to different country where people already and it's not something I would regret author of Gone up in multiple different countries. All my life and something that really scares me is the idea of being trapped somewhere that I don't want to be and so for me riding the USMLE Step 1 is a way to keep my doors open for the future so if I decide I want to go to the station I will be already on that path if I decide I want to go to Canada tax medicine the future I will be on that pot and suicide like staying UK that's what I'm working for these doors open should I change my mind in the future can we put the second half over on common external bleeding"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him intimately I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University this video I'm going to be answering a various question some of them about medicine applications and some of them about like General Life as like a 5000 subscriber Milestone cuz that's like a thing that people do on YouTube 5K subscribers thank you very much if you subscribe to this channel if you haven't there still time you can take the Subscribe button down to the one up there and everywhere because I value your time as always in the description to every single question so anyway talk about it at the same time I don't know what else I would do at Uni and what could you do from just a normal science degree as a good question this honestly is sort of the position I was in I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I plant medicine so I feel like it's quite a weighted grades pre prod iPhone at 6 years at University was can be better than 3 years at University which is why I decided to go for medicine degree and it was the best decision I've ever made and I wouldn't I would like not look back people sometimes say that you know you should only apply for medicine degree show that you want to do medicine but I think that's not really I think it's it's unfair to expect someone to know at the age of 16 or 17. They want to become a doctor for the rest of the 50 years of their life because I like the idea of studying a medicine degree even if I'm not a hundred percent sure about things up to you yeah. Do you think that taking up a position of responsibility of head girls / school council would really help a med school application or if it's a bit overrated interesting question I didn't have anyplace no response it's cool other than being a prefect I mentioned the fact I was a prefect my personal statement I think had less than zero impact on my application I think if I was head boy it would have had a little bit of impact but overall I think there's much to be worried about if if you do have a chance to go ahead go ahead go for it because it puts you in a nice position to be in with your school AZ like good length gives you good relationships with members of stuff and is a good way of like a genuinely getting the skills that you might need doctor later on in life but like just for the sake of it I probably wouldn't want to do it as an if your only reason for wanting to do it is because they will have medicine application run for it if you really want it but don't run for it if you think that I'm doing this because you live going to have any effect stool ulcer to be honest when it comes to interviews and they ask you stuff about you know your experiences of leadership of teamwork it's more about what you've done in these roles than about the role themselves like the fact that your head go ahead boy doesn't doesn't matter at all if you helped organize something like orchestrated and old people Charity Dinner whatever you do in school. This kind of stuff you can talk about it's not going to matter that much for your application universities like it if you viewed being a doctor as more of a scientist and honestly I think it depends where you Oxford College has a rule about the whole research thing but in general people interviewing you for medicine admissions at most almost all universities would prefer you to view being a doctor as something about caring for patients rather than I'm doing a medicine degree so I can go into research so the short answer is yes University's do like it more if if you can view being medicine has like a caring thing rather than purely axle of a coldly scientific thing what extracurriculars would you suggest for building a strong CV during medical school like during medical school on important to bring us from building a strong TV because by the time you're applying for jobs Foundation job matches not at all what extracurriculars you doing I think if you're applying for an academic Foundation program and you like you're an Olympic medalist you got a few extra points for that but honestly no one really cares about your extracurricular activities and pick the extracurriculars. you enjoy the enjoy doing that like it helped you develop skills generally rather than taking them again on the basis of I think this will help me further down the line questions about medicine application medical student stuff now which one's a little bit more into it if you're into if you still here question number 6 is what do you enjoy most about medicine what's your favorite specialty do you like helping babies come into the world which is generally quite a happy thing and the patients are generally so if young and healthy Specialties deal with chronic conditions and this kind of happy event coming that's why that's currently my favorite specialty these days maybe that'll change is the teamwork aspect of it I really like the fact that you and your team of doctors and seniors and juniors and nurses and videos everyone else you'll like working together for the benefit of the patient and the socks like that just like good Bunch from the team's good found from the woods and it's it's that team. that makes it really fun and it's it's it's that time that I make that thing I've enjoyed most about living in Connecticut as well as my replacement send answer the weather's like 3/4 of us on a surgery placement going to the middle of nowhere because we're working together. O-Cedar All Things by Madison the intellectual challenge the United caring for people in adults but for me personally I think it's the teamwork aspect that I enjoyed most questionable 6070 think of lost count at this point how did you get into medical education / public engagement can I go to Medical Education because I saw an opportunity to make the money I Found a Peanut chords for some students at my school when I was liking first University in that seems really liked it and then I decided one day use my web design build website around this to be not crash course and they're marketed nationally because why not and that ended up getting bigger than I could have imagined so so that was kind of these last five years what I've been doing with with sekhmet my company but now it sounds about to say but I don't really care about making money from education anymore I think I like I've grown to really enjoy just medical education education generally for its own sake so that's why that's why I enjoy doing teaching sessions I'm not getting any money for it but that doesn't matter it's just fun to do something anyway it's of and because I spent five years teaching be an entry courses I'd there for grew to like the process of of education and teaching people that which is why I'm I'm into that prospective student but I'm struggling to get the word out how do you start / do you have any tips Jaden G if you're starting something then don't really expect to get any readers or any of yours anytime soon most advise that I've come across from podcasts and books regarding anything any kind of creative Endeavor is that for the first few months to you you're going to be just shouting into the void you going to be writing stuff consistently or you should be writing stuff consistently and not giving a talk at all about whether anyone's reading it the idea is that at some point when you're writing improves and when you know they're the right combination of circumstances happens people and at that point they'll be very useful for them to see the backlog the oldest person people been publishing Medical hospital every single week and then they'll become your loyal fans but there is absolutely no point in trying to get the word out there when you've got one or two person make it a consistent thing make sure you're writing a high-quality stuff on a regular basis and the readers will follow overtime don't worry about in a short time as for me honestly there has never been a point where I wanted to go fight at University I don't know everyone has experienced another people find University of struggle and people do dogs have for various reasons for me personally. That's that's that's a good Chris Pratt quotes he said that every year since the age of three has been the best year of my life and I would I would probably agree with that every year just seems to keep getting better and better by you no luck with the grace of God or whatever you want to call it never felt ever the nice profile university but I appreciated that's my friend experience about this in the next couple of weeks at some point in general a few tips first day motivation is is pretty much a mess and we should be using discipline stats to get stuff done with a good quotes that goes something on the lines of you don't wait till Olympic form for training you train in order to get into the internet backbone so it's just about breaking this link that we have between I need to feel like doing something before I do something is DLC just you know you just do something and you'll develop the motivation and the enjoyment later on most of my procrastination activities but quite productive in themselves and that it would either be playing other kind of a bit or like browsing for my web design inspirational stuff like that that helps me be more productive spheres of My Life on YouTube about how to patch of logo watching of Logan taking tips mentally about you know how how they're doing and how they're doing. It's the stuff I got to have productive procrastination my head but I have planned out like a legit video about this they'll give the time in the next few weeks. How do you deal with rejection so they will be in the next couple of weeks maybe 2-3 weeks at some point in General RV like stoicism as a soda philosophy on dealing with rejection serenity prayer that God give me the serenity to accept which I kind of change the the courage to change what I can and the wisdom to know the difference when it comes to rejection. Then fold into the sphere of things that we have no control over the only two things we have any control are all rentals and Lauren actions I so if someone has rejected us from here romantically or academically or like professionally that was something that we don't really have any control over but it was for absolutely no and it even thinking about that or even so depending on it we will use it what you will use as an experienced reframing failure as yeah there's an experience I've done from this this is going to take away from it and move on with our lives because we gain absolutely nothing from from joining another stuff Avital exorcism as like a way of way of living to reduce negative emotions but yeah that was in the actual video on how to deal with rejection what inspires you the very general question professionally when I mean doctors who are really nice to that patient's but also who really know their stuff very good teaching the students and who also take it take it all with good humor like they don't take it too play they don't consider themselves like the kings of the world for being doctors they don't have this attitude a lot of medicine doctors have to oh my God oh my God I work so hard and Medicine such a hard thing if people who have that attitude quite a few of them in my time those are very inspirational one day when this whole YouTube thing you watching this video at this point the Refuge of Gary vaynerchuk is is one Casey neistat Peter McKinnon do the people who built audiences from from the ground-up who have really good work they deliver to go to Value consistently for free and they've built this episode of personal brand they built this through business around the fact that they're just providing value to people in either from leaving or like photography Royals are like life entrepreneurship advice to people like that. I like watching on YouTube and that I do feel I feel inspired to attempt I mean okay Alexa questions or I think from various various friends of mine so four of my Asian friends ask me various degrees of have you got any tips on how to get married when do I plan to get married and so on I will leave that for another video but I will refer you to Dina Tokio and her husband's YouTube channel which is good if you want to know more about marriage and the description below question from one of my friends is how do you stay so humble what are the secrets you everyday look on what is life like post 5K subscribers how do I stay so humble wearing a gray t-shirt and wearing black jeans and I wear like the same black jeans every everyday and wash them occasionally go to the gym then it'll work out I bought you a question is what is what is life like post 5K which is a Pity that's a bunch of questions I think it does raise a wider point that about this whole thing about having Milestones when people say that when I has been something or when I get that three bedroom house then I'll be happy when I get that raise then I'll be happy when I make $1000000 down and invariably that's obviously never the case it's it's more as you know in the immortal words of it's about the climb you know it's it's not about reaching reaching the destination there is an absolutely incredible. entitled the day I became a millionaire and he told me about the story of how he felt when Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon decided to buy a tiny stake in this company for a few million so he and his business partners suddenly became a few million dollars Richard pretty much overnight about the feelings he had when he sold his money in his bank account in the stuff you bought and ultimately he says that actually he realized that you know the things he wanted to do was before you know continue programming continue working with his company cuz he's spending time with his friends are family you don't even answer that so Yakety Yak what is life like post 5K life goes by Paylocity no different to light post one kaori Veneno post 206 cry because I'm enjoying the process of making these videos on connecting with you guys it's nice because do I get more more comments and if I ask something a poll on Instagram for me Instagram please or if I ask people to send questions in for a 5k subscribers credit then they're coming in I mean it's it's no different it's about to climb as Miley Cyrus says I link the Spotify to the song time to load thank you so much of your subscriber if you're not you can pick the Subscribe button cuz I make videos most weeks about like life is a medical student educational educational stuff about how to get into medicine singing songs with my friends and more videos DOT medical students in Southside tips false keys and this kind of stuff so yeah thank you so much you're amazing thumbs up if you haven't subscribed"

            "text": " aprons welcome back to the channel today we're doing something a little bit different than usual and I'm going to be taking you through the 10 levels of being able to play the piano and sing at the same time so you can go from a total beginner to being able to sing something like this if we go it goes something like this baby my favorite song and so on and this is all just me not really knowing how to play the piano but just following a series of mathematical formula across these 10 different levels which I'm going to teach you in this video and whenever I something like this on my Instagram story Instagram and I think when it comes to playing piano especially it can sound and it looks a lot more intimidating and difficult than it actually is and hopefully show you this video by just following a few formerly and by using a cool website and you two can get to the point where people will think that you've been playing the kind of Fiat piano and singing at the same time let's go into that is where we going to go to website for The Ultimate Guitar Tabs and the name of the song for example Perfect by Ed Sheeran and we going to find a series of chords that have a decent so this one has 33,000 reviews which is pretty good going to pick him up and now this will tell you the exact chords of the song that you want to play and that is basically what we going to be what we're going to be using the main thing as well is that for the puppet video we going to be playing in the key of C major don't work them done with that means we basically you want to use the transpose button on this website and make it to the first the first note is a C I'm going to go all the way down now my first note is a c and that means the owner I'm allowed to play for the rest of this song are the white notes stuff about keys and different majors and minors and all that kind of stuff we don't really need to worry about it just yet I might do some videos about that in the future if you guys are interested and my friend John actually has a Star Trek costume description about music theory if you care that we're going to ignore music theory for now and just focus on the things you actually have to know to be able to play the song basically what we have now is we have all of the chords for the song I Can See I Found a Love is a c and then it says it's a how much is a minor and we just play the notes so to do this you have to Google what are the notes of a piano a t e f g a b c let's play the seven notes c d e f g a b you don't need to touch any of the black notes Apple we're only allowed to play D7 white notes and so level 1 of playing the piano and singing at the same time is where you're singing the song but playing just a single note while you're singing and Ultimate Guitar Tabs of telling you what that note is so for example I found a love for me darling just Dive Right In and follow me I found a girl beautiful and sweet more like the debt is where we getting very slight offence here by playing the octave so on a piano we have cdefgabc so CNC this is the same they're just an octave apart and a piano just has these nose repeated DCCC it's all the same note just an octave apart and so now and we're going to play and we can play we can play with a right-hand I prefer playing the octave with the left so you take your pinky and your thumb and we are playing the octave I never knew you were the someone waiting for me spell to get really interesting and now we are playing chords with our right hand and so when it tells you an ultimate guitar what the code is like C or a minor or aphogee you want to play that code you can with Google the peggies course in the Panama but essentially the key of C major is very nice because basically it's always the same shape it's play the note skip playing Skip and plan out hopefully recognize this a very distinctive sound that like is makes up the bases of a lot of music so this is cooled a major Triad major because I'm happy and try it because there are three something there are three dots in it so this is the c major Triad it's a c skip a note E skip a note so that's what is the G Triad volume headed be given out be given out the G major Triad minor quartet The Sounds have the sounds of it must have this would be like in a major which is a bit more happy where's this is so sad but again we don't need to worry about what a minor chord is in the key of C ABA skip a note play the sea skiff It Up play the E and so your hands can be in this like a clue like position C A minor face2face you can see that my hand is might my clothes position is just not changing at all I could even do it like this we just be three fingers and I can just get ready play that would be how you play the plan so I'm going to play with my thumb my index finger and my ring finger cuz that's how I like it by the fire and now we going to sing along over the top once you've done a little bit of practice with it I found a girl beautiful and sweet not knowing we were just kids when we fell in love not knowing darling just kiss me slow I didn't notice a seaplane over here is exactly the same as a c played up there and it sounds exactly the same one is lower than the other can a minor played over there so this is the major Triad I got was giving a load of stuff about music theory but I'm going to take you through the 10 levels as quick as possible so that you can find out more about these different bits depending on which level in your ass all right where we going to play Finance but we're going to add some Rhythm to it so you're basically going to want to play them on the beat of the song for example so if I'm playing a chorus right here I know it's a minor f c g and the chorus is like twice as fast as and it's a telling me when I have to pay the chords ultimate guitar so big my a minor UF with the beat of the song the beat of the song is going to change depending on what song you're singing so that's if we did I'm here what should say the same beat as perfect Aaron but it's it's it's a bite and so that is where you're like the Rhythm while you're just playing that simple try that we already know two hands together not remember how earlier call to replace the octave to this is the Co-operative a octave voctave go to the left hand with the Triad in the right-hand that is going to be fun Ultimate Guitar Tabs tells me to play a C going back to let's say we're going from bus to well with my left hand and with my right hand I want to play the prior and I want to do this is staying in exactly the same position and this is all I'm gay she shares my dreams I hope that someday we'll share to carry more than just my secrets to carry love to carry children noticed that I'm reading it with just my right hand it's a bit much if you were them it would both so I'm just holding you up tip with the left hand redeeming with right hand the bat is level 5 movie going to level 6 now this is getting really fun now we're going to do the same thing but we going to play an arpeggio with the right hand now this is a Triad a C major Triad made up of seeing G and play the court who played in together but now we're going to play them separately you can do this with all the cords to The Sassy going to a minor like to see a minor little bit of practice but this is just a broad overview and now we can combine anything together we can play the octave with the left hand and we can 5e I'll catch you with the right hands you might find it easier to just do the right had initially so that let's just do the right hand while working alone we are still kids but we're so in love fighting Against All Odds darling just hold I'm going to add in the left-hand octave just playing baby cement favorite song and then sing the code on the right-hand takes a bit of practice but this is already getting us to the level where you know if someone looks at you playing the piano on them now we're going to be arpeggiating the left hand as well and this is where it gets fun now naturally ends up for example if I'm playing a C my index finger and apology and this is V what would the last note that tried being the answer isn't G and so when you're playing with the October the left hand at this level we're not going to add in Wicked Aladdin V we're going to add in the G as a note that were allowed to play so this is what it would sound C A minor can eat facing I'm hitting a day adding in that middle note which is the 5th which is the end of the Triad if it was a play it again if you haven't done music this will seem like a very second nature to the Sith where your index finger and the blending and so at this level while singing along we can occasionally hit that middle note of the left hand chord that without that were paying but those thing to see I can play like this where it's just the octave but I could occasionally kg so if I was thinking a minor this is trying to eat and if it sounds pretty legit so so you'll show you what the sounds like when I'm singing what I'm just occasionally hitting that note so that would be let's move on to level eight at the end level eight is not where we going to arpeggiate and alternates in spam the notes of the left hand so again if I'm playing a C I'm only I'm allowed to hit cgc play an A Minor aea gf9 ggdg and I'm going to spend this on the Left Hand by like randomly and this is now what this sounds like if we are doing so I'm just going to play a tryout on the right-hand and I might occasionally Rhythm it the right-hand and left-hand I'm going to play around immuno random notes in the arpeggio so here's how I might go if I'm singing along at the same time I found sounds pretty what to do with our right hand and also a left-hand this is where it starts to get really fun cuz you can do funky things with it so we know where the Triad is we know what the octopus with v and expand those notes that sounds reasonable aesthetic and that kind of goes with the rhythm of the song so here is what that might sound like last sound waiting for me canvas painting vitamins and with better practice this skeleton sound reasonable one-way making it sound a bit more reasonable is not going super Ham on the standing of the note so for example and then something much more ham on the course because that's like a bit higher energy but really the only notes on playing at the Triad in the right hand with that pole position on the octave in the left hand with the Nina index finger occasionally thrown in really know what you're doing when playing the piano that's never going to level 10 or we put it all together with inversions alright level 10 is now we talked about inversions not this is not here but there are different ways of playing every chord let's take a C major chord between Oasis and we know that because the keyboard only has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Notes that were allowed to play and then like mechanical the Blackness and then everything repeats so playing a c and e energy is the same whether you play be there or up there or up there or up there or down here it's all the same chord progression 8 you don't have to start on the official note of the court if you want to play a C major chord you don't have to start with a c in them you can start with a c and then go down to the notes that you're interested in so CG this is still a C major chord it's just a different inversion of it so rather than the first doing it this is one way of saying it and what you can do as you can pedal memorize the different inversions very easy to do in the key of C major because they do the same kind of handshake the other way of doing it is why the sea is the middle note of the cord we know that c major chord has c e g e and the g underneath so that is another inversion of a C major chord important while you were playing levels 129 around around the keyboard with Lexie and then you're jumping up and down it's a lot of moving around and stuff is generally sounds better when your fingers are moving around less so for example if I was playing a C major chord like this and unmute the next one was an A Minor instead of my whole hand up to an A Minor what I could do is I could play the a minor inversion which looks like that. That's So Raven see and know the difference between C major and a minor is just it's very different Sonic the one no difference between the two I want to play a g and I want to have minimal movement it wouldn't make sense for me to play a g all the way up here because I'm moving my hand a lot so I find one with a minor I might want to play a g like this so I'm taking my which is which is Pinky in the pinky index and thumb I just moving it down one and now it go to G major chord and I for one am F I can do the same things as moved out rather than my hands going all over the place the inversions then as you're playing any of the songs that you want to know where you can get the codes off of Ultimate Guitar Tabs you can choose to use the different inversions off the cords and I'm going to show you putting all this together what this ultimately looks like call a minor inversion F conversion and follow the inversion beautiful route 210 of plane, without taking any lessons by just following this tutorial and random YouTube videos on Google images with practice you can get to the point where you can sing any song in the world that he wants when he brought the clothes of Ultimate Guitar Tabs so this is perfect by Ed Sheeran I'll put a little bit of this and then we'll do a few of the songs so big baby 9 in about half an hour of level 0 through 210 of playing the piano and singing at the same time hopefully you like this if you guys want to see more on this channel kind of stuff do you let me know in the comments down below music is like a really fun part of my life and I haven't really talked about it on the channel much before this little thing I want to talk about more about thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel in this video with tilting about how to get started on YouTube using just your iPhone and so this video is so entirely on my iPhone 10s Max and I'm going to be sharing a few tips and tricks but hopefully going to make the point that if you thinking of starting a YouTube channel of getting into filming and stuff don't need to wait for you know expensive camera or save up for this that and the other you need is your iPhone or Android phone if you wanted those Heathen and you can just get started pretty much from now on provided you keep a few things in mind it'll be talking about video quality using a certain app audio quality using instead of microphones good lighting Framing and additional lenses and kind of the equipment that you might like to add on top of it but really you can just get started using just your iPhone and hopefully I'll be making that point so let's start with video quality and that's obviously the most important thing we'll do some people say political it is more important that they know that you don't really get from the default iPhone camera Avenue and foremost I don't know much about Android phones but I suspect that default camera apps nombre the app that you want to use the app that most people recommend that I would recommend is cooled filmic Pro and the great thing about this app is that you can manually control a lot of the camera settings so there's a few different settings that we want to change when we open up the app and the main one is the frame right normally with iPhone videos they film in 30 frames-per-second but it's either 24 or 25 frames per second that look more cinematic like 30 is just a little bit too smooth and look looks kind of like a iPhone video which isn't really the vibe that we going to be dying for unless you want to go to that 500 do you buy the moment I'm shooting in 25 frames per second and that is the same frame rate issue in mind with my fancy cameras and stuff and hopefully that looks quite reasonable secondly we want to be adjusting the resolution and the bit right and it sounds complicated but basically we want to film in 4K resolution cuz we might as well and what events after that and then we're going to crank up the bit right to his hide it possibly can be on iPhones this is cool. Phil make extreme I think on Android is like a hundred bit megabits per second but it takes hypothesize better-quality that's the way that I would recommend going personally and then just a few of the things going to set you what balance so that it doesn't vary massively anyway to change your shutter speed to one over 50 of the second and this is kind of rule in filmmaking but if your frame rate is 25 you want your shutter to be double that to 1 over 50 is Goldie Hawn 180-degree rule ft. Giving you the best amount of the most cinematic motion blur like when I'm moving my hands like this where is if I cranked up the shutter speed really high one of the two hundred it would look a lot more choppy because it's it's not used to seeing that once you can just save a preset on filmic Pro then you never have to touch them again Turtles on YouTube where they show you in dep how to get filmic Pro and get the right settings for liking but yeah but to use something like filmic Pro instead and hopefully that'll make a big difference to video quality okay now let's talk about audio and I'll give the audio it even more important video quality cuz people will sit through a low-quality video if the audio is good but if you have the best quality video in the world but you're older is crap and no one's going to want to watch a video and go to be honest I have kind of been cheating open this video in the oven recording with my iPhone but I've actually been externally recording audio using this rode ntg4 mic connected to an external audio recorder but now I'm going to show you what it sounds like using just the iPhone just so you know if you don't have this so this is what the audio from the iPhone sounds like just on its own hopefully you'll hear the difference between this expensive audio setup and the iPhone recording but hopefully it'll say that actually if you would just getting started on YouTube with just your phone this actually wouldn't be too bad it wouldn't be this way quality that people be like ground between standard iPhone with nothing attached on this kind of fancy audio setup and that is using a small microphone like the rode videomicro and that sets you back by about $40 I'm going to plug that in and we'll show you what you or what the audio sounds like from the rode videomicro so the moment I have to stop this recording and unplug my iPhone lightning cable and I'm using the rode videomic Pro about 54 go to something like that from Amazon enough connected it to the iPhone using the lightning to headphone adapter that comes with a phone and this is like this other Road cable that cost about $7 to for about $50 we built this microphone connected and a good amount it to this and run them amount that you can get with Amazon for about 10 or $10 or whatever your currency is so now let's hear what it sounds like what this microphone but hopefully doesn't sound quite as good as the old are coming directly from this audio recorder to even if you don't have the money to spend on a lighting set I would like in graeagle whatever you can just sit next to the window and hopefully this looks pretty reasonable that if I wanted to I could get my fancy aputure 120d more to lights Pearl River it is and then yeah I wanted to I could actually change the iso setting on filmic Pro so that dim the lights a bit but you'll see this building actually make that much difference to the video like lighting a super important but just something like standing next to a big window dim this lights that look better with lights as without lights on a sleigh window lighting for example my behind the scenes video of Peter McKinnon video showing how he makes his videos are intimidating seeing these big expensive light domes and stuff but really you don't need that to get started and overtime yet definitely worth investing in do you know results just connected to my MacBook and I'm just using QuickTime Player and QuickTime Player allowing me to mimic what's on my iPhone screen I think using the selfie camera on the iPhone give you less good picture quality so I'm using the normal camera but to see what I'm filming I put it next to my laptop and therefore I don't need anything fancy like that you know the monitor 500lb that attaches to a camera screen and wanted to yourself that way and therefore you can get hold of the framing that you won't you don't have to be kind of off to the side because you could this is the iPhone sitting on this random no brand phone tripod thing I put feelings to Amazon in the video description cold shoe mount on the top which means this rode videomicro can attach a nice day to it so yeah this is a microphone it's tiny out of Justice Crews nicely on to this mounts which is a very easy way to attach it to the phone and then if I were to Vlog for example I could just the setup to take it off the tripod and I have a block set up with a decent lawyer cuz I put the microphone connected to a standard tripod I just happen to have these lying around this is the Joby GorillaPod head again it doesn't really matter what I'm using the point is that you can connect any tripod to your phone provided you have one of these phone mounts and it's very easy thing to get that you know you can buy for a few dollars off Amazon Flex if you want you can go really ghetto and end up just kind of propping up your phone on a stack of textbooks or anything like that but if you serious about starting YouTube overtime you can then add stuff to it so that it's never an excuse that I can afford camera gear as an excuse as to why you know starting a YouTube channel it's just like an internal Battle of okay I need to get over the fear of looking foolish I need to get over my fear of public speaking good things happening in life to talk about extra lenses that you can use it this is an extra wide angle lens that I got from sandmarc they very kindly sent it to me it's not wanted but yeah. Send me the lenses to review because if you attach it to the iPhone what does wants to touch that makes the angle more wide so if we go back to the iPhone shops you'll see that this is now a much wider Schultz I looking for the vacuum and now see the microphone and I'm just behind me so what I would do in this case I would move the table closer you won't see all of that for the crap that's behind we can go see the iPad I move a little closer I move this microphone a bit more up make sure it stays out of the frame but still gets decent audio quality cuz close enough to my mouth get this out of the way at the school acting out of the way I have to change up the framing slightly but some people prefer this sort of mole wide-angle way of filming and being so far away from the camera and that had the benefit that if you're not using an external audio recorder that guy and then you closer to something like the iPhone or the rode videomicro which means you get slightly better audio quality cuz you're closer to the camera because you're using a wide-angle lens so I mean Allen's under a tele lens on the anamorphic lens which I'm going to play around with some point but yeah if you want to go for a slightly different look than the standard iPhone framing you can use like an external lens or something just kind of screwed onto your phone and internet works but yeah don't actually need a lot to start a YouTube channel to start filming like you can just do everything with just your iPhone yeah the OD is not mean to sound that amazing but it's perfect to get started and you can always upgrade later on to the rode videomicro and you can spend spend an extra $20 getting a tripod already want you can spend I like the overtime you build up your YouTube thing and they eventually but if you really want to you can like a graduate to getting a camera but I've spoken to other people because I've been people messaging me by Instagram and stuff and asking for advice for things like stalking YouTube channels on my distressing some have said stuff like I would love to start YouTube channel but I don't have the money for a camera even though they've got like latest iPhone or like a Google pixel or Galaxy S8 S9 S10 whatever already feel like it but yeah hopefully this video give you a little bit of a taste of flavor about how to get started on YouTube using just your iPhone if you like the video please give it a thumbs up over here we will to go a few videos about and you know in this creative Diaries series where I about behind the scenes of my own setup including all the camera gear and stuff they have a good. If you feel like it but yeah"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to the channel if you knew here at my name is LA on a doctor working in Cambridge and this is yet another study with me video for some reason people seem to enjoy watching me go about menial activities like washing the dishes brushing my teeth and occasionally doing for what start around 6:40 p.m. when I get back home from a hard day of stamping out disease and saving lives I procrastinate for half an hour by making a cup of peppermint tea trying on a new t-shirt and beneath I bought to hide my receding hairline and getting rid of the scraggly beard elated over the past week officially starts at 10 past 7 on for half an hour I'm starting the muscles topic of human physiology by scoping subject what this means is that before I try and read understand will memorize anything I'm going through the whole Topic in front the garage the subject in two different headings that means that I get a rough overview of everything in the topic and so when I come across a specific bits of information I can hang them in the relevant place in the overall structure this is one of the most important and underappreciated parts of effective stuff back in my youth I used to relish jumping straight into a topic from page one but now that I take the time to scope the subject best I find that the understanding of the subject comes a lot quicker in these videos lots of people coming asking what specific apps I'm using and while I'm a sucker for I don't think there are many cases where these specific app actually makes much of a difference goodnotes vs notability OneNote vs. Evernote todoist vs. things it'll basically the same stuff and the important thing is how we understand and apply the general rules of productivity and effective studying rather than the specifics of which app will using the only exception in my recent memory has been using notion which I want talk about in this video but I think the design of that particular app encourages our brain to think in more interesting ways and I think some of my Pacific notion videos down below if you want to check those out anyway in this video to make a point I'm specifically looking with notion the new hot girl in class instead I'm using the building middle-aged but reliable Microsoft OneNote and typing out all the headings and subheadings from Alexa I'm using a split screen setup in PDF expert which is a PDF reader app for the map with the type lecture notes on one side and the overhead projector diagrams on the other side which I think I'll lecture used increase his street cred with the students carry 7:45 p.m. switch over to Keynote and begin working on preparing the teaching session for my physiology students I start my building up the basic story of neuromuscular transmission and Faith Point here I run some questions that I'll also students to answer during our supervision the reason I'm writing the notes is because they put the notes already and be active recall IA testing ourselves is the single most effective learning technique ever and I've got a lot of videos exploring this and much more death if you haven't come across it before but just as quick reminder currently unhappy without grades or how much time we're having to put into studying for exams chances are we just aren't testing ourselves enough and if we were to focus our study efforts on testing ourselves with the book clothes would magically find that all grades will improve and by the way isn't just my opinion it's backed up by Decades of research published in peer-reviewed academic papers which again I explained in much more depth in my other videos about active Regal at 8:15 p.m. I get off my proverbial soapbox having been focusing quite intently for an hour and a lounge on the sofa figuring out what to order for dinner I decide on a polo at Aspera Ramona pizza from Pizza Express and then feel bad about spending so much money on a completely unnecessary takeaway feel better about myself I decide to watch some videos on skillshare a platform where I host my own classes on to a very these days on working my way through Mike Valdese productivity cloth which talks about how to set up a robust productivity system that isn't reliant on any particular one issue that I'm working through with my own productivity system and how to make it as an agnostic as possible 702 notional todoist what is shut down easy be able to Port my system over to any other app or even pen and paper if I had to another course I really like is my friend Thomas friends again about productivity just because I'm completely obsessed with productivity and he talks about how to manage it list calendar filing system and other cool things and if you'd like to see more of me I've got my own three and a half hour course on how I edit these very videos aimed at beginners who want to get into this whole video editing youtubing type thing if any of that sounds of your street you can click the link in description to get a 2 month free trial of Steel Chef where you can watch any or all of the causes and then when you're up you can choose to sign up to the subscription Which is less than $10 a month and even though they sponsor my videos I still pay for my monthly Scotia subscription and is genuinely worth the money specially if you watch my own from 9 p.m. I do much of the same thing while I go through the lecture notes really slowly making sure first either I understand everything they're talking about and secondly writing some active recall questions in my keynote for the students if I wasn't interested in making a teaching session out of this I still ACB writing down the active ECO questions again because it is the single most effective study technique ever thought I'd write them down in OneNote on Ocean 11 o do whatever note taking app I was using that month in fact one of my friends ranked second in medicine in the whole university out of 350 ebright Cambridge University students and the only thing he did to study was right active recall questions by himself and then just go through them repeatedly I'm working on the video where I explain the strategy in-depth so if you came to find out more than please leave a comment down below and I will do my best to expedite that process wink Emoji S9 and so I sit at the dining table and try to read a physiology textbook on my iPad while stuffing my face with slight equal Pizza pretty quickly I realize that cold pizza is Noah and so I get a quick blast in the microwave which of course makes it taste better don't at me from 10 p.m. I find my concentration beginning to waver and so I make myself some chamomile & Manuka honey tea and then lie on the sofa reading the book nerve and muscle I'm using the app notability to read the PDF and making occasional notes in the margin to help me understand what's going on I also flag up some bits that I think would make for good reference material for the essays that's me and my students will have to write sorry my students and I that was terrible 30pm I just thought that I've had enough and so I brush my teeth what's the dishes change into my pajamas scrubs and head into bed for an early night I read on my Kindle of around half an hour these days I'm reading the fantasy book ruin which is part of the faithful and the Fallen series by Joan and then on cold at night so that's it for another study with me but yeah I have you found that least somewhat useful if you did please do me a favor and sign up to still checks it ready help support Channel and watch my videos in coffee if you want to learn how to edit video thank you so much for watching I would love to eat do you next video goodbye Alexa lights off in the bedroom"

Just a combination of everything we've done in clinical school so in a way it wouldn't have made any difference if we'd like killed ourselves working the Animal Clinic fire on Easter we do this where students going to organize stuff together and then they supposed to take the grouping like how you doing something few hours before the service starts and then we learn and sing some Christmas carols three days time we realize that most of us weather today any motivation for today so we saw just come here they are examples of the weekend coming off and on Saturday it was one of my friends Muhammad's birthday space is quite small but it kind of fits fits everyone wants to come and we do a Vincent cafeteria today in the evening sometime during the people ordering pizza and other phone to take away so and then when you graduate or where he become a clinical medical then you got to the NCR I would give you access to a different space this is so nice as the first time I've been in here just like a pretty nice atmosphere we quoted some TV ke Bhajan but it's ready more about having like having fun and then I picking you up around it so today is going to be a fairy tale day pretty crochet christopherodd next order of business was to drive down to London for another friend's birthday today and that was a rule the world restaurant in West London alright guy served in a theme of procrastination from Al final to final exams the timer is my brother tomorrow 10 more depending on which part of the body come from and having some cream soda and it's like a staple staple drink in Pakistan we just love it and my mom very kindly. From like to local agent shop I think tomorrow is going to be less purpose procrastinator a but still here is fine see you later good night let me find out the next morning the Sunday before exam or, the Monday we have to get back to Cambridge somehow but the whole isn't opens was pretty covered in snow we got office paper tomorrow today is simply to get back to Cambridge in time I hope the trains are running and if not then we'll just have to Brave the weather in the car anyway today was supposed to be off into Russian but to be honest yeah I really hope this camera is somewhat weatherproof otherwise it would be very expensive day"

            "text": " one of the questions I often get is that you work full time at the doctor and the businesses and how do you do all this stuff and what aspect of that is productivity timer about as much as having this to find creative workflow for doing things like training up videos and podcast and blog posting companies that does the free app notion I've been using the ocean for over a year now and before I discovered notion I had food video yes that would be saved in my phone somewhere I sometimes they even have a note sometimes could have written into physical physical notebook get like ideas in the shower on while driving and then I would just kind of completely forgot about them but as soon as I start using ocean and started developing this everything had changed and now I can turn up two or three videos a week hopefully the Reidsville quality if you're a YouTuber or you want to get started with YouTube then maybe you'll find the director helpful but even if you're not I still think there are a few takeaways from this that you might find helpful the three pieces of notion that I used a lot in that is kanban board template and Link's databases and to be honest even if you using notion for project management of your school work of a Seder assignments whatever these are really helpful features my creative process that will give you some idea as to how you might be able to use this whole thing yourself so let's talk with the high-level overview of how the soda crazy person. you can see videos here that I know status and 47 ideas that is just under a hundred video ideas and I've got going on and I've sort of been collecting these video ideas overtime cuz whenever I have no idea for a video and go straight into notion straight into soda just bits of this kind of creative funnel 8 videos of including the session videos script ready for review column and this is where I forgot play for my team members has written the script for video tweaks and change the language so it's more like how I would speak on camera editing then it does not ready to film and this is the coelom of a video that I choose from when I sit down and decide okay what am I going to come today I have a look through once I filled it was going to go into this film column and then I'm going to upload it for a Google drive to my client editor who will be editing the video and then that's going to go to the width of the column they are moving to America videos and then go straight publication once everything is sorted and we're basically and get stuff out of the other end as a published video this is quite helpful because it means that if I want to make video then another one like two or three videos a week it means that me and my team that whenever starting from scratch but never the case of thinking of crap it's a case of let's pick something from here and let's do that it's kind of like with writers that if you have like a a good note-taking process you never need to start from a blank page I use this kanban board Style Style kanban board think videos but it was easy for buck person human these letters on a lots of writers who have kind of the ongoing writing project is something we'll start as an idea then Publix I think it's having this little work clothes ready supercharged my own ability and ability to one thing that we would have to get done on time is the sponsored video schedule so most Tuesdays Wednesdays will release a sponsored video and those of the videos that have some kind of deadlines deadlines top of this video schedule here you can see a sneak peek of what's coming up on September and we can see if this is an ocean sponsor video link to the videos database this is a relational singing rather than just having individual databases you can link those databases to each other so we go one database response video schedule and we have another database videos sofa golf what I can do is we bought this girl's dream video coming up in July I think that and then it's going to let me search through all of the different videos and that's a we were doing a personal Knowledge Management Theory are there that would show up and then video change the status of that too ready to film if either. Will domestically updates within this link database and that's kind of the power of space than this little relational relationship do you have with an ocean to calendar for example we can kind of see in a calendar exactly what videos are coming up at exactly which videos of sponsored and which ones not which is quite helpful and deadlines we got in the database and so if I want to add a new video idea to this I just hit the new button and then we've added to the database and I want to show you how we use templates to try and make better videos my friend's home has Frank told me about his own notion setup for how he makes videos I watch that on my mind. Incredible the point where this is now the process that we use for making videos of the tunnel so just start again we go in the videos de today to take the new bussin and then we can are donuts good for you I can handle that do not affect this makes me feel a little bit Dead video template this is now been significantly flashed out in a way that means I don't have to continue afraid of the states to idea so now we know this is not here I can look through and I can set all the different parameters for this video at 1 so that set myself to the writer we do need to set up an idea I'm sorry if I want to this this is the template and I think the template is really good because one of the things I like about discovering new apps and you were close is that when you find the right one that works for you and for the thing that you're doing it becomes almost like it encourages you to think about either way that you can talk before making videos you can just use pen and paper to organize your life just as well as you can card yourself to think about things in the way that you want to think about anyway so we'll be doing stuff and leave these details about the video and then a publishing checklist how are use the video template to kind of go through that you know this is horses that I used to actually make these videos I've been streaming favored few times a week for a few hours or a stream where I'm using notion to make videos and stuff you can follow my twitch profile Link in the description and then you can follow along in real-time ask questions. Do stop in real time I see that we've got this notion video coming up on July 7th and so that's going to be the video that I'm going to make today so what are we doing is this is a a link to my video database let's go into the video database and we're going new on let's call this one notion video 7th July something something that's based Leon Iowa Thomas Frank uses no of course name this individual descriptions you want to check it out when I hit new video template look what happens all of a sudden or all of this stuff that has been pre-filled by default and this encourages me to think about making my videos in the right kind of way and this is sort of a hound ocean transformed my a video production process cuz I don't really have anything like this before anyways I'm going to say writer is me publish date is the 7th of July status writing in prose sponsor this is notion video attention. I want my people to discover the channel through watching this video genre apps and partly productivity and creativity is another one channel this is for my main Channel editor is going to be my boy Christian editing this video is sponsored date this is a link and it's a link to the sponsored video schedule so I can do now as I can find this video 7th of July Anica NADA in here and now this is updated because it takes the writing in progress from there and that means that immediately I can like I'm looking at my sponsor video schedule I can see okay where we call the gaps and why do we need videos so that take care of these three Let's get fit into the pretty one of the 28th I'd be able to look through old video ideas and I'll be able to figure out the K which video we will be going to plug into the brigand sponsoring July 28th anyway at the back of this video notion video 7th of July opening as a page I can kind of ignore the rest of them but I want to show you the temp right now so it's it cost me for the title and the thumbnail first and this encourages me to activate think about what the title and thumbnail for the videos is going to be I'm going to brainstorm some ideas here so unlike some of these are ridiculous but having the five love hair just encourages me to actively think about what the title should be which is something that I did already do for him and then thumbnail like actively thinking about what's the temperature going to look like so we can say okay so now let's move on to the actual video and the key thing here is that within this template I've made self think about the story so this is one of the seven Parts standard story structure so who's the character me what they want and I've highlighted points in before and then because commonly these are the bits that's people pay less attention to when it comes to stories and either I'll give you the most important bits of telling stories and so I I've had locked them in the template and therefore brings my attention to it okay so this is a sore thing that find if every video and it's ridiculous and all of these within the video but just kind of forcing myself like asking myself these questions. Me to think about the video in more of a story mode fashion rather than in a human Kara 550 which is what I used to in the past another template thing over here and this is also based on one of the courses from video creators with a very good and this lays out to the two different story structures so let's go over the three-act structure first we dropped in act 1 the cartoon something up to the character faces conflict in act 3 character overcomes or is overcome by The Challenge usually the carpet comes a challenge and yeah it is you want to create tension and I don't think of himself think the three-act structure is this old video cuz this isn't really a sort of a journey kind of video instead I think the hero's journey is what is kind of work maybe we can totally see this video so calculating the status quo I can talk about how you know places before nation was just like really bad and I want something more exposed to take action because now I feel like a full-time job and I need your system one of an unfamiliar territory must adapt experiences Victory is like all you know who discovered Optical help from others discover Thomas like to go this way hasn't Inwood realization that about how tools for thoughts like notion are important in giving us a nice workflow on the back of somebody's her tree I ate all I'm not sitting at my computer but now I've Been Changed by the Journey of universe appreciating the app that I death will change the environment that I've not got this whole this whole process videos so this is another way that I can think about telling the story in more of a story so the fashion again this is just something that I keep within the video template so that unfolds to think about if every single video seafood pasta video there's the hook the intro the value on the custom playlist to the hook is going to be I don't just want to do a hey guys welcome back to the channel That would be Saturday in true I want to think about sort of a 10-second hook that Discovery Motel to the first time he'll be like I kind of wanted what I kind of want to watch the rest of the video so we think the way we thinking about this is we put the title in the thumbnail but set an expectation so that's a Hound Oceanfront full my creative process say that the title of this video and let's say we're using this sort of thumbnail the video is taking the beer is taking on the video expecting to get some sort of value from it and I wanted to live without value within the hook that encourages them to keep watching so how transform my creative process now I'm kind of thinking about my video in Stanton disease for parts and in just a few minutes I've kind of got a structure in mind but it just gives me a good structure that I can use for absolutely every single video like this you know uploading and Publishing checklist the description bolt-action to the sponsor tags and called caption files using rev.com which is a caption service vinyl take boxes to the end unit make a week this is a bit of a mess I look behind what the process is like for creating a video like this one myself studying using myself making these videos my workflow for different other aspect of my life and how I managed it using notion to thank you"

            "text": " this video is sponsored by Squarespace whether you needed the main website or online store make it with Squarespace tentative for efficient studying now if you seen any of my previous study videos you'll know that I love to go on about this thing called active recall which basically just means testing yourself it's the single most important official study technique ever and there is a mountain of evidence supporting it if you haven't please watch my videos I link them up there and down there and stuff I'm going to assume that you know that testing yourself is the single best way of getting pretty good marks in whatever you do flash cards with no sign of all apps lock and key in Quizlet and if you're anything like me and you haven't got the discipline to every single day sit down and get three or 300 flashcards I think they can become a bit of an annoyance rather than a help so that's why the Google Sheets I'll talk about why are you at the end I'm going to show you the Google sheet that I used to revise for my final year Medical School exam examination neuroendocrine Durham towels which of the musculoskeletal think is based on having questions and answers in Call of Duty pretty much that simple so let's look at my liver disease or category and I've got to myself what might be evidence decompensation liver disease what investigations would you like complications of cirrhosis classification of cirrhosis ascites with fluid in your abdomen how do we treat these various questions about liver disease and so I brought them August 8th with fun color block so I could see what I was doing but then once I've written the answer I you know text color-wise which means what I'm looking to the spreadsheet icon Sienna Beyonce's and therefore this is active recall when I see a question I have to actively retrieve the information from my brain which as we mentioned earlier and in all of my previous study videos is the single most efficient study techniques a way to look through the topic in the other column I'm pretty sure I know the answer or I knew Johnson 6 months ago when I was doing the exams are done thing I can remember the answers to a lot of days but you know I'll do some spaced repetition Beyonce red ones down here what are some problems logging Transportation around the end of the revision. I was doing this thing where I would hide some I didn't need like between here and need to go through so I can just hide these two these two columns and then you end up cleaning up your spreadsheet you want to have a session or an hour or two where you just going through every single question Google Sheets insert flashcards reasons I really like the fact that they tend to randomize the order in which questions are asked good because it means that you're having to dredge up information that's in different topics and there is this thing inefficient studying send a lot about the subject to wear the suit of recoil you're going to be off to do it's going to be systematic like let's say I see a picture of the stoma indications for a stoma they might ask me what a Hartmann's procedure is this whole stuff related to astronomy Quizlet what are the complications it's good to have this knowledge of the top your head but I think I prefer the systematic approach where I can have you know this mental model of stomas and just kind of know everything about them in one and actually replied that one Topic at a time rather than just getting us cash account of different questions about various problems in the abdomen spaced repetition algorithm is going to flag up the things that I don't know and often I'll have to go through a hundred cards where I'm pretty sure I know I didn't know how to do it so that's the stuff I'm going to do first and if I just scroll through the exam I see this quite a few red yellow and oranges so I'm going to spend some time on this today I'll be looking at these rides and this becomes a very quick way of reviewing questions easier to work together with friends so if you seen any of my previous study with me videos from few months ago when my friends and I were preparing for a medical exam we don't have like sections where I put up the Google sheet on my big Monitor and one at a time that is possible with flashcards I have died in the past with flashcards by just found that having tried both of them it was It was kind of nice to just go through a spreadsheet in the right order I prefer Google Sheets the flash cards because flashcards become an absolute bird and like I mentioned at the start of the video you see that you go 250 flashcards review that day activate phone record them and then look at the answers of Google Wikipedia attentively in first and second gear. Unless I have like an hour or two to sit down and do my flashcards to treat it as such a big deal that I ended up not reviewing them very often once once you record something well then you Mark has yellowy marquez-greene and it give you that little boost of endorphins that make you feel good about studying overall open Google Sheets on my iPhone or iPad laptop or even a random browser and it just works it's just pretty magical finally I just want to end by addressing a question that I've had from little people over the last year or so the dimensions what do you make a flash card for and what do you use your Google sheet for an already don't have that distinct a categorization in general if I was to come up with the rule of thumb for very very very isolated facts so for example what is the dose of for community-acquired pneumonia I kind of prefer do seats for more General understanding key Concepts I said one of my previous videos that I quite like the phrase what's the deal with polymyalgia rheumatica it's a bad question to put on flash card cuz if you look at the evidence that it's better to have you know a distinctive thoughts whereas just explain polymyalgia rheumatica is very broad open-ended question some of it down on my sheet on my shades or just make a mental note in my head to repeat that information to rehearse it to add to record it and then I can mark that particular box as yellow sometimes if it's a simple if it's a simple thing like what's the differential for aortic stenosis ejection systolic murmur I can write for things and down in my little spreadsheet column but if the question was explain polymyalgia rheumatica I probably wouldn't write down anything in the color because I would trust that if I don't know what it is if I can't explain it to myself in my head I'll just Google it I'll be able to explain it so go to the time I think we can waste a lot of time making the flashcards but specify stuff like medicine to wear every single thing is just a Google away is almost no point in adding tons of information and duplicating the information and making your own oats fireflies those two points I don't really have that distinction between soft cotton sheets but I kind of prefer sometimes. Write out the answers in the column at all if I can just Google it I'm not the point that I want to end this is just what works for me this thing about Google Sheets being better than flashcards is always signal gospel truth the only gospel truth in this whole study tips stuff is at the RICO and spaced repetition in fact it's better than Dakota Ridge Mountain of evidence supporting actor recalled special edition steam things also things like elaborative encoding an interleague practice you can find out more if you read the book make it stick videos of those on those over time something amazing to sedated locate lost about it I prefer Google Sheets the flash cards full some things that's not to say it works for everyone let's try it out see if you like it and if it looks website design and hosting and content platform Squarespace is a 1.2 if I ever need to make a website just because it's really easy to get set up because and things like that if I'm making website for no limitation that doesn't have coders working for them they can use it's so easy and it's reasonably priced on this apple is really good you can just message them at any hour of the day and then get back to you within a timely fashion so"

            "text": " or the budget iPad 9.7 inch and because I'm a fan of upfront conclusions and saving you time I'm just going to tell you that I would not recommend the iPad mini trunk down into the fun pack of an iPad mini and it does have apple pencil support so if you want to you can use it to hand write your nuts but I think the drawback of having such a small screen is not really worth the fact that you have have such a small screen you could afford it will be a lot better going for the iPad Air which is only about 80 lb more than the iPad Mini is an issue then you should probably go for the 319 lb budget iPad which is 80 lb cheaper than the iPad mini consumption is not that great for Content creation is not great for handwriting for taking notes you can so to take notes on it I mean I was taking notes on this but I think in terms of real-life use cases when are you ever going to be in a situation where you only have this amount of space on a table two to make notes I mean you could use the iPad Mini 1 I can't think of any circumstances as a student when I would need to hold the iPad 1 how to hold a pencil together hand and actually take notes and do do this in a way that I can make sense that that's actually tangible I'd most often be sitting in electrical or sitting at my desk table in front of me and now I could use it to make notes I could say I could pretty much a right whatever I wanted that but because it's so small budget 300 lb iPad screen allows you to not have to scroll the page every every few seconds so for that reason I probably wouldn't recommend the iPad Mini for students or if you can afford it you might as well spend the next Friday pounds and go for the iPad Air 3 Split Screen functionality is possible but it's not great it's really nice having another screen or 10.5 in screen Etsy but notability open on one side and you go web browser open the other side you can then drag-and-drop images from one to the other that's quite a nice feature to have it works a lot less well on the iPad Mini because it's such a small screen and unfortunately the iPad Mini also doesn't have Smart Keyboard connector like the iPad which means you can easily attach an Apple keyboard to it instead if you want to keep would you have to go for a Bluetooth attachment an overall that's at the last night's experience than having a keyboard that's just so they built into you built into your iPod by the way if you were student and you're going to be using the iPad for anything that involves the apple pencil I find a recommend you get the paper like screen protector for it this is something I've been using for the last year plus I don't like it does feel like paper when I'm writing on it that one guy pots to review and I have to test the apple pencil out on them it just felt so weird writing on glass like to the point that I think there's only a bit of difference between the iPad and the iPad air into the screen but there is a world of difference between writing with a paper like screen protector and pricing on a glass screen so the paper like enough money for a cup of coffee you can help support the channel along with my caffeine addiction if you want is it paper like screen protector PayPal come check it out by the fact that the screen is small you contrary multitask connect apple pencil writing is similar to the iPad keyboard that's why I wouldn't recommend the iPad Mini for students other than that it's like really really good so I made another video I talk about exactly which I would recommend someone who just uses you can seem content to watch Netflix YouTube web browsing replying to messages on iPad Mini that there's 100 make that amazing and actually I bought the iPad Mini the iPad and the iPad air from the Apple Store two weeks ago for the purposes of this video and I'm going to be returning all three of them cheeky but the one I was thinking of keeping this is actually the iPad Mini because it's just so noise it's so cute when is puppy iPod minion and it weighs pretty much nothing at all it weighs just about as much as my iPhone does so I was actually seriously considering keeping you up how many so if you're in the market for an iPad Mini sense of that word you will be far better served with the iPad budget over the iPad Air"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel and to the first proper study with me video of this new season if you need to hear my name is Ali I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and I'm preparing for a specialty exam In Obstetrics & Gynecology so as usual I'll take you through my day explaining what I'm doing play you can pick up some study tips or just waste a bit of time on the internet whatever floats your boat I'll be honest to study days but the exam is over a year away and I came across a great quote the other day which is that consistency is more important than overall I did manage to get a decent amount of work done run a few errands and having friends over to the evening for a gourmet takeaway courtesy of just eat who are very kind a sponsoring this video so the day begins at 9 a.m. When I Wake Up Normally I wake up for work a half past 6 so I can hit the. Thing at half past eight but today I have the day off so I treat myself to a bit of a lion by then spend the next hour and a half having a shower and then procrastinating on my phone anyway reply to some of your emails and spend the next hour deciding whether to use A-1 notes for my personal revision guide quick aside this idea of a personal relation diet is something I've not really talked about before but it's something I'd recommend for subject where you don't have an easily accessible summary of stuff available at a glance I've been using one for the last few years of med school but I decided to give another try and I'll do a more detailed comparison video once I decide which I prefer so I'm looking up the syllabus online I spend some time creating Evernote notebooks for each of the 17 subjects within muscle beside then recreate this organization notability on the iPad using a main divider for my open Ghana exam preparation and then 17 subjects after each area of the syllabus at this point you might be wondering why I'm using both notability and Evernote the basic idea is that I'll be using notability essentially act as a rough notepad where I can take handwritten notes where I can scroll stuff down while I'm doing past paper questions where I can test my active recall the concept by writing down everything I know by drawing diagrams and then my notebooks in Evernote are going to be my own Mini 2 electrical at my personal revision guide IE where I put down concise summaries of stuff but above those I'll put down on my active repo questions for that particular topic so the idea is that I'll be able to click on a subject that say I don't know early pregnancy medicine and then within that just at a glance see all of the 20 different topics within that take on any one of them and see all my questions I've written for that subject but then I do see all of the all of the content in a bullet point format and I'll be doing more videos explaining in more detail exactly how it works so I decided that's enough work for one morning and I spend some time watching the dishes cleaning the kitchen and Wilmington soup and bread for lunch I then grabbed my boosted board and head over to the hospital to First deep drop off some lunch for my house he's at work because I'm such a good friend second late to pick up a fun little package that I had delivered to the hospital on Sudley to hit the gym because I missed my workout that morning thanks to my lion I got home around 4 p.m. when I make some coffee and unbox this new fancy Apple watch I'll be doing a review on later on at this point I've got around two and a half hours before my friends arrive for a fancy just eat takeaway party so it for the next hour or I go through each of the subject on the specification the first lady in notability I write down all the topics I think should belong in that section based on my medical knowledge and then I'll look at the proper specification and I feeling what I've missed out in another color and I found this helpful because it forces me to ask me think about the big picture and about my previous knowledge where is if I just copied and pasted the specification I would really be using my brain at all and that's not a good thing another three more points I want to make about this whole school thing to subject thing first while I'm writing a chopping down I casually run through my memory and think about what I can remember from that topic just like a few lines but topic is again the principle of that actor equal is a way of life I eat in an almost everything that I do study wise I'm using active recall in some way because obviously it's the most efficient exam prep tactic and whenever I'm not using active recall like if I'm writing out notes or if I'm cooking and pay stuff on the internet there's something within me that feels really sad because I know that everything other than active recall is just a super inefficient way to study and therefore I find this works as a good signal for me to not overly rely on things like making notes or I'm cutting and pasting stuff from the internet because I'll just be fooling myself into thinking that I'm actually being productive secondly as I'm doing this whole school thing to subject thing I came across a few areas of the specification that I'm a little bit suspicious about the subject anatomy and embryology huge topic that entire text books have been written about an umbrella G which is the study of how human being formed in the womb from conception old what is supposed to be in the touristy Hot Topic it makes sense for it to be on the other guy specification because it's an important part of abs but I suspect it's only the very Basics that I'm going to need to know rather than the whole thing and actually within most subjects there are these topics like this one that are included within the subject because they've got some other ones but actually the details you need to know about these topics is much less than the other and I think it's really important to flag these up early on so that you don't waste time going too deep into topics that aren't as important or on as examined as others listening to my Spotify study with me playlist instrumental tracks from film Liscio's classical music musicals and more I spent the last six years curating this playlist it spans about 45 hours so far and I update it every time I come across any song that's interesting or you know if I decide I don't like something the evidence says it's probably to not listen to music at all but if you are listening to music then the evidence says the instrumentals are probably better than music lyrics Because Musical lyrics interferes with the point of working memory processing I'll do another video about this music but because I want to enjoy studying I'm more than happy to take this light efficiency head that comes from having instrumentals in the background because everyone just makes a much nicer kind of feng shui when when doing work around 5 p.m. I find myself getting restless because I've been doing this subject and talk to Regal thing for about an hour I intend to take a ten-minute break but end up spending our jamming on my guitar and recording a bit of Castle on the hill by Ed Sheeran for my Instagram which you should definitely follow if you're not ready and I like to call this technique productive nation which is available as well that makes me feel less bad about spending so much time doing it from 6 p.m. to 6:30 I finish off the scraping of the subjects icon of blood through this loss because I'm getting bored by this point and it's almost time for my friends to arrive for under the takeaway and board games party and by this point I've got a pretty good overview hold a subject with an ABS and Ani for the exam when my friends arrive World very excited to order from just eat sofa Rusty we spent about 20 minutes actually deciding where to order from because it's just too much Choice and then once we decided local Chinese restaurant that we all like a week Rider on the what kind of combination of taste and healthiness that we can we can get from it in the time it takes for the food to arrive we bust out the board game Catan which is awesome and we just enjoy each other's company have a little chat Power jobs that sort of thing then the food arrives co co Justine thanks again. video Q cinematic Montage of us eating food after devouring of food we finish off a game of Catan in which I came second sadly with my amazing Stone and sheep strategy and that brings us to the end of the day thank you very much for watching and thanks again just eat for sponsoring the video do you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed yet please consider doing so have a lovely day I'll see you in the next video goodbye"

Please do drop a like on the video on your way out so the way I see it everyone uses an iPad in a slightly different way but it can essentially be plotted on a spectrum from consumption on the one hand to Creation on the other hand so if you're in the consumption camp that sings like YouTube Netflix web browsing reading books using the Kindle Apple iBook things like that that is the consumption category and all the way on the other side with the creation Spectrum music production you know the pro applications of an iPad and then the middle is things like writing using a keyboard taking notes using an apple pencil maybe replying to emails and the way I see it is that the closer to the creation Pro end of the spectrum you presently are the more money I would recommend spending on an iPad if you're purely in the consumption temp for your iPad use them I would personally recommend that the iPad mini and the reason I recommend the iPad Mini over for example the budget iPad for the iPad Air is that the mini can you can hold in one hand and the one-handed use the mini is an absolutely incredible let's say you are commuting it's very feasible to hold your iPad in 100 small enough that you can pretty much take it wherever you want without having to worry about it so that's why I'm against the iPad Mini detailed review of the iPad Mini coming a little bit later on spectrum of consumption equation that say you're a student and you using the iPad to take handwritten notes or typing up stuff the iPad small to really do anything meaningful and if you're in the creation company wanted for example take notes with your iPod is all you're going to be taking those on a Surface so there's not really much of a difference between writing on an iPad Mini into space and writing on an iPad Air but it is a massive difference the size of the paper and how it feels like to take notes like I tried using the iPad Mini to plant some of these videos and is doable but I wouldn't want to do it all the time we're at the iPad Air is an absolute joy to use when using it for handwritten notes possibly with keyboard attachment or do we go for the iPad budget and there is 180 pound difference between these two devices and what I'm going to argue is that I would recommend you go for the iPad Air okay so whenever we're buying anything in life I think we definitely want to keep diminishing returns in the back of my mind and that's the idea of that spending more money on this thing does not necessarily lead to an equal gain in benefit and equal gain an output applies to iPad Zicam the graflex something like this and let's assume that the iPad Pro do so at a cost of let's say about 770 L because that's the most basic version you can get let's put that at 100% on this graph so we have the 319 budget iPad and I would personally cook that at about 91% of the iPad Mini the iPad Mini is 399 I don't really think if it's on this graph but if I have to I probably 90-92 is about 479 lb of $479 and I would set that roundabout 95% or thereabouts and so the graph of cost versus that looks something like this and this is the perfect illustration of diminishing returns you get to a point where the more money you spend on iPad it gives you very much and I'll improvements in value Improvement in quality of life just to be pretentious or the bed is admittedly quite a big part of it but it's because I think it's really important to understand that the budget iPad is very marginally less good than the iPad Air and the iPad Air is only very marginally less good than the iPad Pro if you are going to be spending the extra hundred 80 pound difference between the iPad budget and the iPad Air will thereabouts all the extra 450 lb difference between the iPad Budget on the iPad Pro I said the iPad Air is the one that I would recommend for most people and the reason I said that is because I think this 180 lb price jump between the iPad budget and the iPad Air is worth it whereas I don't think the 450 lb the budget and the pro is weather so what are the differences between the iPad budget and the iPad Air that make the iPad Air 180-pound upgrade the three things basically attachment possibility and thirdly the amount of power that you get a nice talk about you can't answer the screen this has a very nice glove screen where is the iPad incredible device and it's amazing that you can get something as good as this a319 pounds but the display does genuinely feel like a piece of plastic and so if budget is really an issue for you then the difference between and plastic is sort of significant in my opinion there is a very slight difference in apple pencil writing capabilities this iPad budget has a little bit more of a gap between the screen and and the internal there is a very slight line for the optical the apple pencil but it's something that you don't really notice unless you put them side-by-side the iPad feel like you're writing directly onto the screen again experience is kind of seminar it's just to be healthy side by side iPad is very slow screen protector for it this is something I've been using for the last year plus I'm so used to it does feel like paper when I'm writing on it that when I bought these new iPads to review and I have to test the apple pencil and then it just felt so weird like to the point I think there's only a bit of difference between the iPad and the iPad Air in terms of the screen but there is a world of difference between writing with a paper like screen protector and pricing on a glass screen so Safelite using that link that I make about enough money for a cup of coffee so you can help support the channel along with my caffeine addiction if you want to get it it's a paper like screen protector paypal.com Smart Keyboard which lets you attach this origami keyboard to your iPad Air which means you can then send me easily turn into the laptop replacement keyboard lot more easier for the iPad budget you don't have that option if you want to attach a keyboard to this you have to go through a third-party Bluetooth option so for example this is a Logitech slim Pro case or something like that Styx here and then you can like attach it I think like this so that I can fold into this all packages it's kind of heavy it's not nice but I mean it does the job on this thing I think was about 70 lb one is about 150 lb and you need an iPad and it's just it's just a bit less nice than using the official Apple on a first-party product and finally in terms of power the iPad Air has the newest processors its go higher geekbench benchmark scores the iPad Air than the budget iPad so those are the three main differences screen keyboard and power and those differences allworth 180 lb students the iPad budget pretty much does the same thing and you probably won't notice much of a difference but it's enough of a difference that it justifies 280-pound price tag on the reason behind that is because of the Delight factor that comes with the iPad Air and iPad Pro you can do the same stuff I was just a little bit nicer to use it's a little bit more delightful it makes me want to use this and I think the very fact that it makes me want to use it is what justifies 280-pound investment now that's to Maine behind this the first one is that it's a generally pedaled piece of financial advice that you want to be spending your money where you spend your time so people often say that you should invest in a good bed and you should invest in a good pairs of shoes because you were spending the 28 hours of your life single day in your bed and with your shoes are for any extra money any extra value that you get out of those things is going to be exacerbated over the long-term and this is a concept that my brother likes to refer to his measure and we talked about that in one of our podcast episodes if you want to hear us talk about this concept for about 50 minutes on it but there's a second part of it and that is something that I've had left off and on the internet. I think we want to be spending our money where we want to be spending our time so what do I mean by this let's say I want to buy a new sofa that would encourage me to spend more time on the sofa because then myself as more comfortable. So offended by God is not right comfortable Tesla come together with my YouTube running for the last like 3 years and then whatever I decide to buy a test of myself that would encourage me to spend more time in the car more time driving is that really what I want to be doing with my life do I want to be spending more time driving Game of Thrones night we have to watch it on the monitor but encouraged me and my housemate and a friend to spend more time watching TV which is not something we want to be doing spending I think that is something you do want to be doing so for me when I was a student and even any time I spend on my iPad is too productive because of the things that I do on the iPad questions you'd have medical books on it so if I was spending time with you it would be productive I've been learning stuff for productive for Creative purposes than the fact that this extra investment of the iPad Air is a bit more of a what use will encourage you to use it more and therefore it becomes an investment in your life that adds more value of a Time rather than just a liability stuff you might think that okay well I've right to the iPad Pro is 100% of rated the iPad Air is only 95%. 5% increase in value is worth 300 lb extra investment between the iPad Pro and the iPad I think this hundred 80 lb different than $90 difference in dollars is probably more durable for love people than coming together an extra 3 400 lb for the iPad Pro yes Pro is a slight increase in quality of life compared to the iPad difference justify 300lb experience of writing with the iPad with the apple pencil is identical to screen is pretty much identical the only real difference of the five that you can magnetically stick which is nice is really nice to have but probably not worth 300 lb this keyboard thing another like 200 lb you don't have to fold it around in the origami fashion again power that just has the ex-champ doesn't know much of a Canon Rebel with the code to the power doesn't matter to me graphic editing don't need me to tell you this of a video what time is it outside in business that generates money on the other side I pretty much exclusively uses for business purposes so it's a tax-deductible expense there a lot of factors for me that mean that's all I would go for the iPad Pro but that's not a recommendation that I can with any any good conscience possible to other students please get the iPad Air incredible thing like you have a ton of pasta where is the biggest platform for online courses and I particularly enjoy tosses about how to edit videos I've gone some tips on how to use Final Cut Pro 7 for example disclose by Benjamin Holt cook think like a chef series which is the way that this video was edited and produced take a deep dive into exactly how I make these sorts of videos about filming editing post does two months if you decide that it's wise that you can continue with a paid subscription my p**** got paid subscription I think it's worth it you learn a lot of stuff that's produced really well. Thanks again steel shaft sponsoring this video I'm hopefully August. If you're a purely consumer consumer and the iPad Mini is the one for you I think the 100 most of the iPad Mini beats all of the benefits that a slightly bigger screen with 319 on pounds you don't even the extra regular green apple pencil for it cuz all you doing is watching stuff that's absolutely fine if you're a student then I probably recommend the iPad Air in fact if you're most people and if you wanted to become more of a something you can do for the official Apple keyboard thing then the 319 iPad is absolutely incredible it's astonishing that you can get an iPad this good for only 399 but if a very slight bit less powerful as long if you can afford to cut out the extra hundred 80 lb of the iPad and then I would recommend that and finally if you're about to be on a iPad Pro I'll be using the iPad are just as often and I probably won't really notice much of a difference so that was a wrap up of which iPad you should buy in 2019 I have you found it to be useful how to check out when you put cause that me and my brother started its goals not over-thinking I think episode 3 of the episode 4 we talk more about purchasing decisions and why we recommend for example investing in a kitchen bin versus investing in for example do you all think that I'll see you in the next video goodbye"

            "text": " activate Channel if you need to get my name is Ali I'm finally a medical student at Cambridge University and this is the second in our video about evidence-based revision tips and today we're going to be talking about spaced repetition and how you can apply to your own study retained if you haven't seen the previous video and here and everywhere else please do watch that first that is about to wreak electrical is by far the most important thing you can be doing right now to make your studying much more efficient thanks you can full of those as you like and now here's a structure the video cuz everyone loves a well-supported video sharing with you a little bit that's how you can incorporate specialization into your study techniques and into your life generally considered I'm going to be talking to you about my own personal magical spaced repetition spreadsheet system that I've been using for the past few years and that when I was using like properly got me really good Martin like images so yeah that's a stretch of the video feel free to jump onto the timestamps let's talk by talking about spaced repetition any evidence behind it what is spaced repetition where you spaced repetition off to get a subject over. Of time it is in contrast to what is a very popular revision strategy but as we all probably intuitively know when you cram for a test the next day you can probably remember quite a little bit because it's like in your short-term memory but by you know maybe the next day or the following day you've completely forgotten all of it so cramming is social if we're talking about retaining stop in a long-term memory space reputation is that instead of coming things into single day we spread out or revision overtime and we review topics idly by active recall at particular intervals basically the reason why it works is because of something called the forgetting curve I've been around in the psychology different and that's something that we can all probably intuitive experience for ourselves you probably had that feeling something and then induction over time we forget things at an exponential rate so let's say today I studied the anatomy of the Upper Limb and then are reviewed again tomorrow I have interrupted the forgetting curve so while previously I might have forgotten half of it by tomorrow now I'm only going to forget 25% do it again 3 days later I go back to 100% now it's going to take me even longer to forget it and the ideas that the more times we do this the most spaced-out or repetition becomes the more likely we are to encode all of this information into long-term memory so now we're never going to forget that supplies the posterior compartment of the arm because we've repeated it so many times over such a space interval that the forgetting curve no longer applies to that piece of unnoticed on the standing so just remember something so we going to make a revision timetable doing things right I'm going to revise topic 1 in chemistry is on that day and then over either going to wait later in the week is August a space in your reputation is better than running the thing that I personally take home from the forgetting curve is it actually that the interval that which we spacing the pots there is a phenomenon in the Sequoia so excited that you're sure I link some studies better but I won't bother staying in that basically the heart of your brain has to work to retrieve something from it the most stronger that information gets included spatial position is that you allow your brain to forget some of the information such that when you revise it again it's not mindless repetition it's actually taking you some brain power by Noma brain power takes the Hardy brain has to work and therefore the most strongly that information is encoded aventurine studies it's relevant because it means that we have this kind of idea of starting of spacing things are like a narrow interval and then spreading the interval out of the time so like sending my example and asked me if you're playing let's do it today let's do it tomorrow Malaysia a week later than a month later we repeated it five times we space these representations we allowed ourselves to forget a little bit of information in between the interval such that when we revise the topic we have retained so much more than if we spent five times as much time on the first date of trying to cram being asked me if you're feeling so that's one point about space station study session like in the same day of work you space stuff out rather than kind of do it in chunks the evidence suggests that that's probably more efficient technique in terms of retaining information translations in Swahili only study the word once and these were the results and as you can see they didn't do very well that's kind of what you expect if you so like a vocab list of French words in English translations you probably won't remember much of it if you just do it once which would once and then had to recall each word once and then were tested and this is their performance sargentina just recalling a word once as we've already established in the previous video after you recorded pretty great increases your performance massively compared to you know just studying it the third group also recalled the words that they if they knew but immediately after each recalled they had the record of the same words they record the same words kind of multiple times before moving on and these are the results as you can see no difference between just the guy that we called it once the most interesting the final group so each word and then recalled it but then had a gap of a few words before recording it again so you know they they repeated the recall of it but they spaced that repeated recall of it in the same study session these are the results of these guys did exactly the same amount of work they did exactly the same thing they study for the same amount of time as the people in group 3 the guys that kind of recalled in her in a group and then find another one record in a grape it's exactly the same work like literally exactly the same work the only difference is that it was spaced-out relative to group 3 and that give you different selection 50% in exam performance about you but like if if I could restructure I was doing the same thing as I've always done but just kind of doing it in a slightly different order and I could get such a massive performance boost I would be doing it all day and I'll be shouting it from the result yesterday I already knew that cuz we seen the previous video about how to recover the conclusion to draw from this is that in a given day let's say I've done five topics of mirror for praying for my house keys or whatever what I previously would have done is I think one of us do what Provisions that we do one Topic in the morning floats like 2 hours and went on the next one and then in the said when the 4th and the 5th one I think the thing that I take from from this particular studying from similar ones like it is. There is a lot to be gained by just going over the stuff like testing yourself on it maybe our two hours later let's say you don't want to talk to just before stopping I wonder how much I can write down of what I remember from Suffolk one or I wonder if I can answer that with the RICO question tourettes myself for topic one I know I'm going to be doing it tomorrow anyway because you're not part of my space & one seemed to suggest that even doing that in the same day the same study session really boost your box that's pretty much spaced repetition in a nutshell first space station over. Of time better than priming that's on controversial groundbreaking but I thought he had that even like spacing stuff out within the same day within the same study session has the potential to really boost your marks and if it does have that potential pretty amazing event of nothing that great it still has the potential to improve all scores and improves a longtime understanding and retention of the tub so I think it's something that maybe we should be practicing to do like a bright down on one page you know what is everything I can remember in the form of a spider diagram from the subject with the book clothes and I think that might be really efficient way to get a lot more information into your brain initial to space and time so that's a dispatcher position let's not going to meet this video and that's why I love you guys have been requesting tips on how to apply spaced repetition to your own studies and if you're asking how I built my own special edition spreadsheet that you might have seen this movie deal at this point that's what it says you're at University I really actively specifically applied active recall and spaced repetition image of comes in all the years I've I fell by the wayside a bit I was like off whatever I am quite him is just going to reread my textbook of highlight stuff because it's less committed setting my voice to you guys would be the don't take my word for this has been gospel maybe try these techniques in your own and your own stuff easier for you than you just waited 20 minutes Technics things that you can do to apply space studies at your life and prefer to use it to memorize specific sites like stuff like in ecology I busted out like you know quotes from John Paul II in St Augustine in my in my ethics essay than they seem to love that sort of thing is quite nice when you can like Tina put a few fancy quotes into an essay does active ECO Landscapes repetition and kind of incorporates this into the software simply that all you have to do is practice a little bit each day for ages and then you just get really good at something and everyone is going to be an hour on the weekend a brain works information intense debate people say when we sleep so we can do a little bit of muscle memory and then we sleep appreciate the power spaced repetition you can apply to everything in your life not just to do your studies at Eurovision I've personally applied this to piano guitar graphic design web design coding like a few different things in addition to like my academic work because it makes the amount of improvement you get for every unit of time much greater than it would be with other methods where you can spend ages doing one thing with Beto doing other things that's why I previously used to do so about appreciate power spaced repetition consistency and patience effectively doing a little bit each day and improving groundbreaking on that everyone is trying to learn musical instrument Provino's this the secret is you just a little bit each day and being consistent staggering potential to just let you let you gain so many skills that you would be so glad for in a long time and finally lets me talk to you about my magical space spreadsheet system saw uses and Second City or did really well in my exams and I'm using it in my final year and I hope that I'll do quite well make them using this method basically the way you do it is that you make you can download the app on your phone that means anywhere you are weather girl you're like on the bus or on the toilet or in the library you can update your magical spreadsheet if it's a. XLS file on your desktop Google Sheets that's what you do is that you make a different sheet for interview subjects in biology chemistry stop if your medical student open apply this to your own life August 8th and the idea is within each kind of broad subject of the spreadsheet you're writing down a list of every single topic in that in that subject let me recently I like like actually knowing what's on your syllabus and it's pretty astounding how few students like know their course inside out know what topic there are there a AA sna to chemistry you know exactly what's up with the Rind biology I think that's that's one thing that if you haven't done already that you definitely should be doing like spend as long as it takes I even if it takes a whole day just like you in writing down a list of all of the different topics specifications specification I absolutely hate specifications I just like to see what it is like a note 1.1.0 03 to be able to appreciate the importance of the nitrogen cycle adjusted the nitrogen cycle I would like to use the specification as well revising personally I'm going to find that ticket help us to look through exam papers because while you can't really trust the specification you can absolutely trust the past papers things into electricity mechanics nuclear waves and that's what comes up which is pretty much all that comes up in Phoenix for the Pima and that's how I kind of got but anyway however you do it how have you scoped you subject the point is you now have a list of all the topics that you need to revise down one comes out spreadsheet and you actively recall stuff from that topic then allowed to write the current date in the in the next column along in the spreadsheet so in this example today at the abdominal exam and therefore I'm going to write today's date in the box now that's a tomorrow at 10 if I if I'm feeling sticky lazy if I'm feeding efficient I would actively recall I would be using my own questions and then once I've done that then I put tomorrow's date in the Box over time I'm kind of building up this list of repetitions of my subjects an example of the spreadsheet that I used in my surgery what I was doing psychology reference this in the video the collaboration which of the three different like papers within psychology and overtime I've built up this this kind of repetition dates like once I've read the essay and kind of like grown-ups by the diagram for the date and I think anybody use for the color code each box based on how good you recover hippocampal if I knew it very very very well I would cover green if I do if I didn't really know at all I could read if I sort of knew it may be 50% sure that you got like you know creations of red orange yellow like so it gives you a very visual representation of what am I weak areas what am I strong areas and that system is it simple but it works really well the ideas just that you know overtime as time progresses well I know everything in the subject because it will be my queen and I know I know it because the only reason I'm about to mock a date on it is a five to be recalled information from this topic it's not just have a rather talk shop in the textbook have I read over my notes that is a total waste of time have I recall that have I tried to write down as much as I know about the topic have I answered my active recall questions for that particular topic on one side and then all the time with you revise the topic and actively recall it please along along the rest of it color coded based on how good you are actively recording information that you don't know I know I already come do I students with chemistry chemistry like open the TDP revision guide play Thunder by chemistry I want to do with easy please. That's about things to do and these days if I ever find myself doing that I like mentally kick myself in the head this is especially true of lecture notes at University how you find that you do you become very very familiar with the contents of like lecture 1 and 2 and 3 but like 13 14 15 out of like maybe 18 and like a bit like a shaky on those and it's so tempting when thinking I'm going to open the book to the first page I think it's a terrible idea or the Lost Peyton work and work your way back because that encourages you to Taco toppings that you already don't know and as we've established the more effort it takes you to learn g2a delivery call the strong with that information is going to get encoded overtime so that's take a very sort of Scottish shortbread for it each day I try to fill in as many books as I possibly can because my reasoning is it's far better for me to Blitz through a topic and then from actively recall questions and then do that same thing for like 10 different topics over time then it's me to come spend ten hours focus on a single topic which I might have been more tempted to do in in previous days and I think that's something that we we focus on like I want to get really good at this topic before moving on where they think this kind how to approach with a spreadsheet is that you know I know that I'm not going to go to the topic but that's not the point the point is I'm going to be repeating the traffic light 8 times before my exam comes around I want to just kind of in a bit say it like right my Rico questions like my activity Rico make my brain work and then we want them connecting after that and this is the technique sort of in the literature assertive with evidence is pulled into Leaf practiced little bit of one thing and then you know before you quite have most of it you switch to something else let me switch to something else studies weather like unlike hockey players in life coaching methods and stuff and they do practice at one thing and then like the players get slightly annoyed because they were just getting good at that particular move before the coach movement move them into something completely different but you have a time that you result improve so much more take this approach where you couldn't do it a bit recorded move on to it if it was cool about moving to debate record of it move on rather than right I'm going to do and I'm going to get really good at the fundamental chemistry I'm just going to write down a list of all the questions I can think of I'm going to go to them to the questions in my head for the book close to answer the questions right let me talk to you can pretty much go through the entire the entire textbooks she give you a reason guys last letter whatever you using you can do that in the matter of a few hours if you take a very sort of got a gun like I don't care about the detail I just want to make my brain work to recall information about this if we don't like focusing a monthly article topics and if we don't treat a revision as a block of chemistry and then unblock of chopping block of that instead and then the next day I think over time that builds up a stronger knowledge base I don't understand through a lot of topics and then to get through a small detail because I'm not detailed already helped us the active-active recalling that's really building the Texans and I'll bring but yeah I think it was rather than I really want to get that box green full movie budget system on Google Sheets so I can figure out where ever I am I use active recall obstinate I also my list of questions I've written for each Topic in my head or out loud or on paper or whatever I'm feeling like and then once I got to be recorded by Mark the dates and I could have Cody easy it was to recall and it gives me a nice kind of pictorial representation of each of my subject subject and how will I know this thing's so I know exactly what to focus my attention on him in Future Vision session finally I'm going to talk about why I personally don't like the eye revision timetable I know this is blasphemy I know a lot of other revision YouTubers who are doing with the idea of revision timetable timetables is that you're expecting yourself to know how much you need to revise a particular topic so I like back in the day when I used to make a return timetable HP light right on on this day I'm going to do that... but you know my problem was that I'd be repeating topics that I didn't need to repeat or I wouldn't be spending as much time with suffix that I didn't need to repay so ultimately I realized actually revision is it is a very fluid we'll find different things difficult will Progressive study different race so if we make a timetable 2 months before our exam where were telling us has reached I want to stick to this topic. Topic and what kind of regiment it like that I don't think that works instead of more fluid thing and that's why I really like my spreadsheet system because it doesn't give me any compulsion to do particular 4:50 today to do is each morning I'm going to do some revision for Section 8 on my paper 1 in psychology to my list and see which of these essays have the red mark by them let me do those okay perfect does it make sure I still know the greens with that sort of thing I wouldn't have been able to plan to plan out my Revision in advance like that I wouldn't have done nearly so well at the end of the day looking to get me the biggest Improvement but hey if you like timetables and boiled beans go for it if you're finding that your timetable. I have this method use a spreadsheet system assisting me like but don't feel like you have to structure a revision in a regimented fashion run time table it doesn't work for everyone we've talked less about bigger than weed in the previous video of the previous video I think is really really really good if you want to learn how to revise effectively because it's the most important things and because there are a lot of interesting studies around it and because his semi unintuitive like we all prefer to reread highlight on the make notes which baseball positions of it's a bit different it's been harder to make like a a video on the saying the old is going to change is going to blow your mind completely because we will sort of know the space station works we know that cramming doesn't really work very well we know that it's good to repeat stuff and I guess it's say that you order pizza to wait later than a month later and then I'll kind of know about it but I hope that either way and if you go to this point this week has given you some value what we talked about we talked about firstly and instruction dispatcher position but we said that important is well within a single study session may be spacing reputation might be good idea as well because that improves your recall acquainted studies what kind of munch at the months that shifts that is a good way of learning anything not just like academic stuff that you know just a little bit each day is far better than very kind of inclined to do including myself rotation of the day and that's so much better than doing two hours on the weekend and finally I shared with you my own personal spreadsheet magical spaced repetition system I could imagine I like it gives you a really nice picture representation of where you are free to be a subject I think it's really important and it works very well for me obviously this system is no timetable works better than having the spreadsheet system looks to me and if it works either fantastic if it doesn't then I'm sorry he wasted your time please go back to your timetable and hopefully it's nicer exam I wish you the very best of luck growing at an alarmingly amazing rate like these past few days ever since the previous revision video came out of course they promote cooperation thank you after that so yeah is coming about about like motivation productivity how I make notes and unlock make a note set of apps on my phone how use the iPad medical school stuff and his students cancel PMI Utica interviews. So the stuff if you're very very soon to be having some videos my friend singing song So this channel is becoming kind of like a mismatch and lots of stuff but I thank you so much if you haven't subscribe to the Channel please consider things that have a lovely evening I'll see you in the next video goodnight"

            "text": " play friends welcome back to the channel and this video I interviewed one of the respiratory medicine specialist consultant to my Hospital Doctor Thomas and he said 10 things that we can do right now to help combat the spread of the coronavirus the poison covid-19 that's taking over the world basically everything is go Lincoln x x in the figure description out of the paint come and see you can jump on the video if you feel like it and I will start with a very quick summary of everything that we discussed so if you don't have too much time to watch this video at least you'll get like the BMO Stand By Me for your buck out of it took and preparedness being the key rather than Panic instructions from the high command so in the UK we should be following the advice of Public Health England and the government and this applies to whichever country that you're in we talked about the importance of avoiding physical contact with elderly relatives because they are by far more vulnerable than young fit healthy people with conditions for self isolation and the point we made was that basically this situation is so rapidly evolving that you should always consult the guidance from above whenever you watching this video but at the moment the advice is that if you'll symptomatic then you should quarantine like self isolate yourself the 14 days because that's how long based on the research we think the disease is infectious. Your physical mental health and everything exercising during the pandemic just not doing it in crowds with other people the importance of washing our hands special coming into and out of the house when we just been to walk when it's going back home from work I'll switch handle anything that has contact with the outside world please stop smoking it's really important avoid comparing what's happening in your own country and our country in the UK watching this with what's happening in other countries the system epidemiology the healthcare resources in different countries a markedly different and so the advice from car country is going to differ in the UK example of young people not taking the Series game and thinking in a while I'm young and healthy but it's not about you if you're young I'm young I'm pretty fit and healthy but I'm still social distancing I'm still isolating myself because it's not about me it's about the water for connection and I'll do not want to be responsible for people's death because I've pasta virus on to someone else acceptable to assume that was a quick summary of the things that we talked about and now for the rest of the video it'll deducted Thomas sharing his professional expert level advice as a respiratory medicine consultant as a specialist about what we can be doing the 10 things we could be doing to help reduce the spread of I can't respond well to it is one of the things that we shouldn't do because it doesn't help anybody the Panic that spreads more widely than the virus which can be very very harmful to it's important Wyandotte down as Ron Papa preparedness in the rights are we prepared not panicking prepared not panicking definitely you know we're fighting a war we need each one of you to be to get this right you have to keep up because the instructions change on a day-to-day basis because of this process of trying to contain the virus so if you want to think about that analogy of War if we don't follow instructions I come on grab a lot more information than we do things can go completely wrong to make it simple the Department of Health tells you exactly what you should do as member of public at any given time for those instructions where we are right now today is the 21st of March what would you say are the most important things that we have the general public should be doing social distancing is really important driving through cameras number of cars that were coming into town that worries me you know the fact that people are not listening to the suggestion that we should soda be winding down on social activities and I'm saying that is because of virus spreads from one individual to another if you are in close contact with less than a meter you're more likely to get the virus spread your cells if we slow the spread of the virus. What that then allows us to do is to be able to deal with the people are really sick and paste Mana you know so if we if you all got the files quickly together the number of people who died goes off saving lives by following the simple instruction of social isolation and distancing so this is really important at this stage of the epidemic where we are today you need to protect your elderly relatives you need to protect those while barnable on the way to find out who those people are is to go to the NHS England website they actually have a list people General list is people with chronic respiratory disease people of color heart disease diabetics people who are vulnerable because of recent chemotherapy for cancer people who are immunosuppressed because of immune conditions and so on and so forth conditions that principle social isolation has gone beyond that elderly people in particular are also a little more vulnerable than the general population I mean know that very clearly from the data that we have from Italy if you care for your elderly grandfather old grandmother you need to make sure that social distancing Works them that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have social contact because there are so many different ways we can have social contact and it may be that we need to do that more now I said electronic means the whole kind of self-isolation self quarantine type thing like what advice would you have four people about you know when do I know whether to self I today total quarantine myself guidance on this has been a time and they said self I sleep for seven days and then all of a sudden it's changed 14 days and it's been very the reason why this is being different is that we would have different stages of this ademic the government felt at a certain time we will find to be self isolating for 7 days now that's increase of 14 days however as of yesterday we all know that we shouldn't be going to pubs Gathering you know in public places in a football match has been canceled Lord events and concerts been canceled and that is having a profound effect on people's lives and and we can take that away doesn't mean to say that you shouldn't go out would it be okay if I got up early and went for a run yes please do you must go if you don't get your exercise you do as long as you're not running with with with the team or running a marathon whether a shed load the people running together I would recommend that definitely exercise keep trying get your sleep and if you watered about your you know your mental health and stress avoid alcohol I'm preparing myself as if I Was preparing for a marathon okay that's exactly what it is is a message more if there was a time to wash your hands and for all of us to wash our hands now it's time you know so wash your hands when you come back home before you eat your food after you've eaten your food before you leave your house and there are simple things when you open doors you do if you touch the door handle remember the door handle could have air reserve could potentially have had a virus or Latino and that that could that would spread to someone else and possibly does welp to order these simple measures continue throughout the whole epidemic engine continue for the rest of our lives I believe so simple things like stopping smoking could potentially save your life because it actually allows saying an asthmatic inhaler to work better if you stop smoking so this is a good time at the transportation I have to get that it if you need help with stopping smoking that are the Lord websites International websites are local websites that you can go to to try and address that effects of stopping smoking out almost immediately within minutes to Oz 2 days and then the Bennett benefits just keep accumulating as the time goes by 15 state of the cigarettes so certainly vulnerable to getting a viral infection if your current smoker then if you stop smoking so if I were to say to you that in two weeks time that's going to be this High likelihood that you might get this viral infection you should certainly stay off your cigarettes I don't want to encourage you to try not to compare Healthcare organizations across the world it be can't help doing that or whatever it's really important that we don't do that because what is right for Attica under the concept and sounds different to work is right for us to Britain for all Health Service what is right for Italy is different what is right for South Korea and Japan so they kind of epidemiological interventions that you do what depend on your Healthcare System the nation the population of the country Princeton India has a population of over 50% of the population is less than 28 years old so if you start comparing ontology figures Whitley has a high population of elderly people you know who are more vulnerable to this particular virus and say that traits that we're seeing coming out which is very serious you don't get candy frightening and you might think that actually Indians getting it right Bo Diddley NFL is getting it wrong and that's the wrong thing to do what would you say as a researcher position to those people in that Minority of people that says you know I'm young I'm fit I don't care if I get the disease it's only the old people that we have to worry about but you know I'll be fine and therefore I'm going to go about my life as if it if nothing's going on what would you say to this other people we'll have a brother or sister think of what you can do for that grandfather or grandmother died doing things such as social isolation what you doing with social isolation is preventing that growing exponentially up your flattening the Curve that's the first thing that you can do as a young person the second thing that I would say to a young person is it is not only the elderly the Varna World War affected K units with covid-19 so if you think about a life you know we go about our lives and we we deal with most problems as young people will always be people who have vulnerabilities you might have an immune. some other medical problem which wasn't the patterns but unless your system or your body was stressed only that were then point towards this particular vulnerability all the virus itself the lord of the virus that you've been exposed to because you the pandemic is at its Max you don't follow these basic hygiene principles and rules that you can record a nightclub but you you have a raven your room or something you know then you didn't you know and then if there are people who have a particular say strain of the virus because these viruses that they are RNA viruses which can mutate compared to some of everything that we talked about we said that this Coronavirus because of covid-19 it's a very big deal like in capital letters It's got a significant mortality we don't yet know what the long-term ability of is going to be at that point where there are things that we as individuals make a difference things like social distancing and isolation once we have the symptoms and the idea behind the whole thing is that we want to flatten the curve of the pandemic such that we don't overburden the healthcare system because if that were to happen who did that who dies and that is not a place we want to get to but we hoped that by social distancing by isolation by washing my hands by doing all these measures that are being recommended from from Central Command from the top by public health England we kind of flattened the curve we spread the cause of the pain. and if we do that yes it might last month they might even lost years but the longer it lasts the more our Healthcare System will have the capacity to deal with that and the more time we give our researches and accolades working on cures working on vaccines we give them the time to find something that works in the meantime doctors in other areas being redeployed to the front lines try and eventually by this group of people time just seems like a really glad Collective Group after the world don't forget to wash your hat size so that our health system is not overwhelmed with a big thank you to do to Thomas for taking the time to record this video and sharing his expert advice with us and yeah I guess I'll just have to say is stay safe"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hear my name is Cambridge and today I'm doing for the lovely Francesca Francesca has a YouTube channel cool to keep productive decision by the other student a professional of productivity apps cuddles people like Tim Ferriss I wholeheartedly endorse these Frankie for things like learning languages another one you could use is Quizlet Quizlet do pretty much exactly the same thing for but you can't I pretty Falls you can use keyboard shortcuts or as Quizlet has been nice and Twoface and one nice thing about Quizlet is that is very easy to get other people's decks and for example with men with a medicine people would have made tons of decks for things like Anatomy physiology Anki is it is a bit harder you have to like downloaded Anki deck package but it's pretty much the same thing as you know you want to see the card again or you and it just the spaced repetition algorithm Frankie I know it was a Quizlet is really good cuz it takes into account how difficult you find something and then lets you advance from there love is like you mentioning the soda templates people pre create them just saves you a lot of work and you can pretty much go ahead and just coffee and then when you feel bad experience yeah so that's fantastic to Old students in general I was in university if I didn't necessarily have older Focus I needed to in Alachua I just hit the audio recording button and I found that really useful that you can also like on this one I was important like diagrams pictures I'm Powerpoints and PDFs as well that the the teacher was sending over and then I'll just have them old Consolidated one place and are you also use notebook titles I'm to organize life example that this one that was pretty akademiks listening to take notes I pretty much used it to Scott and all of my handwritten notes and then so for example of here this was a subdivision we had on genitourinary / male to follow J about different testicular tumors and renal cell carcinoma know this stuff so this was a suit that's our one of our seniors at Christopherson gave and absconded all my notes and what I can do if this will sink as I can then elaborate on these using the song the one that has an infinite horizontal canvas I can make extra so I can screenshot bits from different textbooks shove them into my notes and then I have this like big document that it's it's going to have written notes I've taken in the lecture because and that's what kept me awake and then I'm going to spend the night if I feel like it anymore cuz I recently discovered I know she does not that you're an absolute expert on and now the way our use nursing services so for example this is mocp the membership for the Royal College of Physicians and I go all my subjects and why do is I categorize everything within the subject into these toggle list so for example Havanese was just funny break apart a whole subject just into a series of various different toggle than that forces me to systematize it in my in my own head but also lets me do things like at active recall questions before yes what do they coming out hopefully the same time as this so we'll put it in the video description you can check that out to see it in much much much more detail if you're into that sort of thing is handwritten note taking apps approach to take notes in medical school and I still use that to this day I need to take it pretty much keeps me awake combined colors and highlights for studying the evidence shows that the reason that it keeps me awake and it means that if I do want to look up things the last day I can just know that down and then look them up later and turn them into flashcards turn into questions. pretty much take things from various different places and I expand on them so for example of statistical supposed drug classification I screenshotted this from from Lexus slide this is a PDF from oski stop.com which items highlighted in an expanded and I just created this Hermosa document where I've used so many result is going to taking photos of my physical notes taken from taking photos from quarters I've been to so that's I just created this monster document but I'm not doing it because taking the message is useful I'm doing it because it kept me away from the lecture and it gives me the single source of Truth almost that I can then build my questions on and link to my house key Google spreadsheet where I had Oldies in question format sorry to hear for gunpla you can see you so it causes of what we talked about parkinsonism so I drank myself for myself quotes as management and I can end stage end-stage features of Parkinson's disease so when I look at these notes are not as reading through them asking myself all these questions I'm thinking ahead to ask you know what the cause of parkinsonism all do I actually know who the management is that sort of stuff you know productivity this is where I would I plan on this stuff a secret superjet is todoist I use this one is my daily task manager so I tend to just plan ahead I'm coming on so like today is a nice ghost documentary edited and stuff for example like one Mojo working on if you wanted to create like a duration on that so you want to sit like 20 minutes per school over example you you wanted Associated to the editing or writing or studying than you I've tried using so many different applications over the years I think the one that ice would have used as a list and then I switched over to things a few months ago but actually now I don't really have to do this Dauphin as a student to manage my time was actually Google Sheets and I use my retrospective revision timetable for that switch all done video on which will be linked up there somewhere essentially I would I would write down the dates so far gone for Kayla to Deaver stretch examination the 2nd of April and then again on the 13th April and then again on the Friday before the exam and if I was feeling I was being pro I would color code these based on how good I was the subject at the time so I found this is being good to kind of hybrid full actually having stuff to do but so that each day I could decide what I wanted to do based on what I was weak to stop and the question I be asking myself everyday is what topic if it came up in the exam tomorrow he's happy about and I would just kind of Target Motivation by Sum not cuz I tried doing to do this and on the other stuff like that and I found out I was just a note sticking to them and be like no funding for stuff that what happened along the way like it might be going out it just kind of ended it changes your whole check apps for Pomodoro timers end Pomodoro I think it's Italian I'm at the main ideas. After for Pomodoro's then you take a longer half an hour break for example so when we were studying together me and all my friends we get together in the Emmanuel College library and we do do plums together is it a WhatsApp group called pump sock my Pomodoro society that still running to the same where we start a 25 minute timer 25 minute timer we do it on the table which means that the timer is starting and then when the time would endovaginal is half and then everyone would kind of relax and wait out of whisper chat for about 5 minutes ago or anything and we go double tap which means of the time is Gustavo again make studying into these bite-sized chunks especially doing it with friends when you're liking it all coming together doing different things studying and and the perfect but if you go off the app then the tree dies so it's a way of forcing yourself to not go on your phone while studying I found that to be quite quite helpful from General application three different journals I've got like a journal journal for you know. and it's really nice to look back through some of my old journals from when I was a student and I talked about some of the angst a journal for nice coming so whenever I get a nice comments on Instagram or YouTube or something I screenshot it and share it to the journal and if I'm feeling sad everything two or three years now so I have like 405 these at home now. And just like see what was thinking the reason why I like going to physical Jenna was because sometimes the handwriting tells a bit of a story and like how you were how you feeling and I look a bit crazy in this but every 3 days and it's just how I feel I'd like journaling as a thing and how even writing down a few things that you're grateful thankful for each day does more to boost your personal happiness then for example doubling your salary and we will work so hard to make money on yet you know it's simple things like just insightful the stuff in life that was supposed to be one of them is going to be a deep dive into how I use notion as a note-taking method fo exam preparation and another one is going to be about General productivity tips for students where we going to be having Francesco Channel subscribe button both of us have a podcast you can find mine at Nova thinking. Come On My Tattoos they use forecast tools they use to sew utility have a lovely day and oh by the way both of us have a podcast 1.3 to 1 Future latest album."

            "text": " all right guys hit the first night shift ever coming into the hospital at like 9:30 p.m. find a quiet moment in between patients alright so we all four and a half hours into the night shift it's about 2:30 in the morning and I've seen full patients mostly by myself so what I did was I I'm in and from the waiting room to the history doesn't examination and then presented the case to one of the doctors and the dopest Loop action and just make sure everything was legit so I saw a guy with chest pain it sounded musculoskeletal but obviously anytime someone the emergency department with chest pain you worried about some kind of cardiac Kohl's so that was just about taking a history trying to rule out all of the Sinister things like you know attack or pulmonary embolism what are the bad things that can cause chest pain chest pain to get what's called a troponin blood test so the guy had his opponent cause a rise in troponin equals probably a myocardial infarction which is always a bad thing I don't know the lady who come in with some pain around the face which was probably going to be a dental I thought it was sinusitis but then the doctor said that he look in the mouth and see if they've got like missing teeth for bad teeth that's what we're dental abscess so we referred her to the dentist for the patient who just came in like so you can see what's going on probably secondary to some kind of chest infection or bladder infection do I took a history from him that was a bit tricky because he didn't really know what was going on and he was a bit disorientated then time place in person and a funny that was a patient who'd come in having teacher so that was quite an interesting history to take any time you're talking to someone who's had a seizure you could find out what happened before will happen during what happened afterwards and was lucky that this person had someone with them of the time we witness the theater so that was good in terms of radius running down on the questions that you are asking to see it and see your history and then we ended up sending them home because in any country do much about a seizure they going to get referred to neurologist and the neurologist will take things from that so virile to the shift asifa quite a nice atmosphere special many patients around there's not myself around and it feels quite camaraderie like so I'm really enjoying it so far stopping over the mess for a 10-minute break and then going to get back in there for another that was a soaked overnight shift and A&E see you in a bit a lady came in into resource from the ambulance and by the time she goes he was very pale Wilson was barely conscious we got her into into resources. Appling County doesn't her and then her heart stopped beating so we put out the arrest cold-blooded people pulled into the room but then I very much take a back seat as the whole Machinery out of the resource team kicked in and he said this was their managing the airway they will let the people bringing drugs Catherine fluid sprinklers off of CPR that was a return to spontaneous circulation Aida patient go to post bacc apparently it's it's very common for a cardiac arrest patient to rolly the world where the body just throws everything into this law stood out of the survival she had a pulse for what and they were injecting adrenaline The Jacka injecting live the things during those are blood gases and seeing the results go more and more bad she was becoming more and more acidotic tape was going up through the roof hemoglobin was going down she was reliant on the adrenaline to maintain circulation and eventually decided unanimously that actually even if by some miracle we could get the circulation back she probably have permanent brain damage so time of death is cold and I'm not really sure how to feel about it but I'm sure"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to another episode of my day in the life of blog the day starts at 8:30 when I wake up and lay in bed for a few minutes pain during the vagaries of human existence unable to live with my own thoughts for too long I retrieve my iPad Air from the sleeping next to my bed and begin my morning journaling practice in the app day one after a few minutes of that I make the mistake of checking Twitter and full interview dopamine hit Rabbit Hole of checking my mentions and replies and aimlessly scrolling my feet at 9:15 I spontaneously decided to stop being a wise man and get out of bed to start the day with a burst of optimism I can already sense that today is going to be the start of something new I had into the bathroom remove my Invisalign braces don't text for hooking me up with those to fix my smile I brush my teeth clean the kitchen and figure out how to assemble this new Chemex filter paper thing that doesn't quite fit my Chemex cafetiere guess next time I'll just stick to the status quo at 9 my coffee and to channel my inner Noemi I watch an episode of The Big Bang Theory when that's over and grab the mugs from the living room do some dishes load up the dishwasher and wipe down the remnants of yesterday's Indian takeaway like The Domestic Goddess that I aspire to be at 10:05 I sit at my desk and make a start on preparing this evening live session for the part-time YouTuber Academy we're in week 1 of the full week life course at the moment with 400 students and a thriving Community I spend a bit of time on questions to students have posted on a forum and then get to finalizing the lesson plan at 11 I have a one-hour session with my business coach Hudson we met when I interviewed him for his book The unfair advantage and now we've become mates and I'm his student in the business coaching program and he student in the part-time YouTuber Academy isn't that fun at noon we wrap up the coolant because I feel smelly I have a shower and change out of my pajamas which for the rest of the day really helps me get my head in the game I Preen a bit in front of the camera and then the doorbell mysteriously rings very special parcel arrives but before I can inbox that I have to make sure my lesson is free planned for the evening from 12:45 I make some more progress on my slides and then after half an hour my lovely attitude Christian remind me that I need to shoot a thumbnail for my MacBook Pro review video that's coming out later today I spend half-an-hour shooting various shots on the overhead rig while having a chat with someone who messaged me on Instagram asking for advice about a business idea that they had at 1:40 food arrives from my housemate Shane and I ate a fly maps and share a tuna melt toasty while watching an episode of schitt's Creek which is on mealtime TV show of choice these days from 2 p.m. on what I have a cool with my team about more cost-effective things we working on automatically tracking data for students based on what off of the YouTube channels and how well do getting on with doing the homework assignments the idea is that we'd be able to actively reach out to students who seem to be falling behind to see if there's anything that we can do to help them out after the cool I spend the next 90 minutes continuing to prepare material for the evenings life what starts at 4 p.m. and lasts for two hours we have around 250 students joining us on Zoom Cole and we go through the idea generation machine a framework for never running out of content ideas we talked through the strategies full Eureka moments the birds on technique and the coal mining method of finding ideas with lots of interactive exercises along the way this is super fun and straight off the saying goodbye to a student I had into a zoom ketchup cool with the team and a five PS of horses who's been running their own support sessions at 7:20 p.m. Apple finished and so that's my official work done for the day I spend the next 30 minutes on boxing at shooting thumbnails with my new PlayStation 5 which is going to be the death of my productivity and this is truly what I've been looking for by 8 p.m. my husband is cooked up a mean healthy meal of grilled chicken mashed potatoes and peas peas just pasta PhD and so we celebrate by watching the Bollywood film Kabhi Khushi Kabhi hum the film is pretty good but it's a bit over-the-top and the songs are annoying along thankfully I'm able to pass the time during the song working on an online course on brilliant to a very kindly sponsoring this video you haven't heard by now is a great app with online courses a mess science and computer science I've been using bring it regularly for just over a year now and it's told me so much in an interactive and engaging fashion on the funcking you quotes about geometry and the nice thing about brilliant is that they teach everything in a really nice first principles fashion with lots of interactive examples and storytelling elements that make for a truly world-class learning experience in fact the courses and Brilliant often remind small group tutorials that I used to have as a medical student at Cambridge University which would be based around teaching a concept and then letting the students run with it and welcome challenging problems and so we end up learning through experience rather than just a tactically if you'd like to join me on the shared journey of improving lots of signs on computer science learning how to code with the accident python courses head over to bring into Old. Shelly and the first 200 people to hit that link will get 20% off the annual premium subscription after finishing a few lessons on brilliant I intend to do something productive but I got caught up in the riveting story of the film before I know it it's 11 p.m. tears in my eyes from the reunions between the two families and the sense that we're all in this together then at 11 p.m. after Breaking Free from the chains of the sofa I get rid of the PS4 at set the new PS5 with some pretty sick Cable Management if I can say so myself I download a few updates stop copying over Horizon zero Dawn from its PS4 disc and I buy Demon Souls on the PlayStation Store to download I spend the next two hours in a video game in Houston dying many many many times in Demon's Souls but having a great time all around so over all this has been a pretty solid day of being somewhat productive preparing and teaching a 2-hour live session for the part-time YouTuber Academy and ending with a 3-hour Bollywood and 2 hour video gaming session I hope you enjoyed this insight into my lockdown life has a link to a recent video touring my whole apartment if you'd like to check that out thank you for watching and see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to the plug today I'm celebrating my 26th birthday in lockdown all on my own so let's have some fun I wake up at 10 a.m. when I immediately rushed to the bathroom for 123hulu smell-o-vision I think courtesy of the birthday cake that my brother dropped off last night it was his first time baking and the cake was a little bit medium rare but it's the thought that counts so thank you for the cake table by 10:40 I showered and changed and now I'm on a mission there's a guy coming from DHL to connect Apostle this morning I need to return but I need to print out a label for it the problem is that my printer has been Gathering dust for the past 10 years since I'm going paperless with the iPad and attempts to save the environment and boost Apple stock price I dig out the printer and then realize that of course it's missing the table so I hung around the house thinking why could I possibly put the power cable and cussing myself for being so disorganized magically I managed to find a power cable that somehow works and then I realize I'm missing the USB cable weird square-shaped phones so again I cursed myself and continue looking through the drawers just as I've given up hope and stop planning the apology I'm going to be delivering to the DHL driver I realize that my piano keyboard thing actually has a USB cable connected to it somehow fits the prince up all that's left now is to find some printer paper which again obviously I don't have a pages from a medical booklet that teaches us how to save lives in a cardiac arrest situation but hey Desperate Times Desperate Measures the first patient absolutely nothing happens the printer make some printing with it but there's no ink on the paper just as I'm about to kick myself again my computer troubleshooting mine kicks in and I print a random page from Safari to see what happened and somehow that was everything didn't blue ink I realize that maybe the printers run out of black ink so I need to print these black and white labels in color somehow so using the skills to learn to be a T14 with pirated software I bring labeled into Photoshop and adjust the Hue and saturation with color automatically make all the black ink turn blue instead and then when I hit the print button it finally Works heating a sigh of relief I wrap up the package sticker labels on it and hope that I want you to use this Blood I haven't wasted the lost 40 minutes of my life returning this package I can finally get to doing something that's actually useful but obviously instead of doing anything useful and reply to various birthday WhatsApp messages because I'm so popular thank you David dobrik for continuing to edit a nose during lockdown at 12:15 or so to stop being a

            "text": " in this video I'm going to take you through the seven levels of long the Journey of trying to remember everything that we read my friends welcome back to the channel if you knew hit my name is Ali I'm a doctor based in the UK and me and you interested in personal development lifelong learning becoming a better thinker and all that stuff you'll know that reading is a very important part of this but if you're anything like me you read a lot of books but you probably forgotten the vast majority of the stuff that you read and probably have enough if you life in the way that you did liked a few months ago I realized this was a big issue for me and so I've been actively working to try and remedy and so in this video I'm going to share what I think are the Seven Levels along this path trying to remember more of the stuff that we read and apply for life we start off our reading careers one the Muggle this is basically way we read stuff but we're just reading it or not highlighting it will not take any notes when already engaging with the material Beyond just possibly reading it when we're mughals in front of that about any topic or whatever we're going to passively absorb stuff by diffusion by osmosis whatever but we're not like actively using any brain power to engage with reading fiction but for nonfiction and when I read nonfiction I kind of want to get some insights for me I want to learn stuff and before I forget everything that I read to engage with a memory of things we might realize that a muggle existence is pretty on fulfilling and so will come across level two of the journey which is the squid level 2 reading stuff but you highlight single underlining the things that particularly resonate with you is easy enough to do if you read on a Kindle you can use one of these like old school things that I don't know what the cold anymore because we don't use it stuff and this is what I was doing since I first got a Kindle in around 2008 2009 all the way through 2018 when I discovered that actually they were more levels along this path and this is fine because kind of nice and it's kind of fun to use one of these old-fashioned antique devices but the problem with highlighting stuff is a we actually don't remember the stuff that we highlight and there is a mountain of evidence that shows that highlighting or underlining does nothing to actually improve on memory of stuff play Goldie highlights but they are sort of hidden away inside a book or inside a Kindle and we don't really have a reason to go through that so that was me from 2008 through 2018 the dark days but then in September 2018 I reached level 3 which recording Hufflepuff Hufflepuff is when you have a systemic system for reviewing your highlights are in September 2018 I discovered this amazing service code read wise thinking about your description and what read what does is that it automatically connects your Kindle account and it pulls in all of the heart I like it from all the books that you read everyday they send you an email with five random highlights so I thought using Reed was in September 2018 and I've been getting this email every day for the first few months I was religiously reading this email and I found this I like 5 years ago is now very relevant to me today and the read what email has surface of me which was really awesome but over the last two years I've kind of become less and less religious about reading my five daily things in the Reed white email I still get it I still open it from time to time but it's a bit and that is when we get to level 4 basically this is a system whereby you automatically pulling your highlights into a central note taking app and so we can see hear a database which has all the books and it shows all the highlights of made in each one so I can since all the boys are going to be in here and it was a lynx very nicely to the location and opened up in the Kindle web app if tweets we have podcast this is podcast are quotes that I've taken to the a pair do I owe a lot more details about the system in my magical inside logging framework video which will be linked up there and so this is level for this is where we I use notion 5cb everything in my life pretty much it's all very convenient when sitting there but level 4 still a little bit problematic because this is still very passive or we're doing at this point is we're bringing in highlights and we're hoping that our future selves will at some point revisit the high just because we wanted and again I've been doing this for a few months now but I found that inevitably all the things are coming up and I was not finding the time of making the time to actively review the highlights of the stuff that I've read in no shape to the front archery because now we have level five Dumbledore's Army and when you're at level 5 for a member of the DEA you engage with books by taking quick notes on the stuff that you right now I'm going to show you how I do this in notion so I've got this book notes database that has all the books that I read fiction and nonfiction date of these categories fiction and nonfiction are created templates that I use for my very quick book reviews philosophy and Magic why not I can save the date that I finished it lets it that was today I'm basically what this notion template does is that it creates these categories Mesa firstly the book in 3 sentences Impressions how discovered it changed and my top three quotes from the book so this is actually very quick and this level level 5 is what I regret not doing with everything that I've ever read Because if you can just Summarize the book in 3 sentences that's like a really fantastic engaging with someone like Richard Fineman would say it's a way of activating showing that you actually understand the concepts in the book until he took one show your work expert Shay work beginning help other beginners by sharing your welcome line You'll attract important people who care about the same stuff as you do and this can change your life so good that was kind of my three sentence summary of the book then I've got Impressions where I just would have rights Tivoli what I thought about the book I have who should read it occasionally I have discovered the book If I remember how I discovered it changed me and my top three quotes not the point of this system is that it does take a small amount of time to actually think about but it's not a laundromat time and like I really wish that if I done this for every book that I've ever read I know I will I'd like today I'd be infinitely more knowledgeable about all this stuff than I am just because I never considered engaging with the stuff level 5 is a good sweet spot between the amount of effort it takes to do this I eat it doesn't take that much effort but I think it also gives you a lot of value when you can start summarizing books in 3 sentences how I discovered a general thoughts on who would like it so I can order the template to lengthen the bigger description so you can check it out and if for some reason you don't yet have an account you should follow the link in the description and get it for free absolutely amazing after I've been using since 2019 I confess to say those for me change my life I organize my entire life around 8 I organize my whole business I used to take notes medical school in to prepare for my medical exam used to track my workout book reviews I use it to script all my videos and what would my team use cases videos about Notions I'll be late to the playlist over there and Festival it is completely free you only pay if you're going for one of the team plans or if you need like additional bonus features that most people can use notion completely free of charge basically for as long as he wants option if you account for whatever reason and if you do they'll be a link to my book notes template to thingy so you can duplicate that into your own start taking notes from books which I kind of get you to level five level six. This is where we start to get really interesting because level six is the Order of the Phoenix the only difference between level five level 606 you're still doing all of the stuff you still writing his book in 3 sentences Impressions how change your life but go to have a section for a summary and notes on the book itself so what I'm trying to do with all of the books that have particularly resonates with me over the years book so I would write five stars books I think of changed my life what I'm doing cuz I'm going through them again and I'm right notes I'm sort of creating my own mini summary of the book but I'm focusing on the points that particularly resonates with me a point that I found particularly interesting or insightful or surprising and I think this is just a really great way of engaging with the book but it does absolutely ages the other day it was 1 in the morning and I was in bed and I couldn't sleep so I got up my iPad Pro I switched everything to dark mode and I had Kindle on one side of the screen and notion on the other side of the screen and it was taking literature notes from the e-myth Revisited book about how to build a small successful business supposed to read I think in July 2019 and that book completely blew my mind and so I was revisiting it and relearning some of the lessons from it and as I was as I was doing that I was taking my picture to notes I was sort of summarizing bits and I still haven't finished yet I'm still only halfway through the book it's actually giving me a lot of new insights because it's so rare to find a book that's genuinely actually life-changing and so when you do like now when I do I'm going to make a point. write my own summary of This Book so that I can really consolidate the points to me there's a few things to keep in mind about this so-called how to take smart notes by in like a whole lot of stuff and even draw diagrams and tables and things about oh my goodness quite a lot of stuff here this summer what is really good this book talks about the zettelkasten method of note-taking which is kind of what inspired this video and so does one level of this is as you reading stuff you're taking literature notes but the audio of literature know it's likely summarize that will making process is that we want to avoid copying and pasting quotes from the book we want to actively try and rephrase things in order would just to make sure that we understand the concepts since 2016 and who featured in a deep dive on this channel and he's basically been taking these detailed notes on every book that he's red and he's got like hundreds of these on his website again that'll be linked in the video description deep dive has this amazing website his blog generates six figures a year for him in Revenue maybe even more than that and a big part of his most popular posts or his summarize notes reviews from books that he's read this is kind of the level where I want to get to where you know in the future on my website, would you find all of these summaries of books and I think that's just like an incredible results and if anyone considering starting a personal blog notes from books is such a big value-add because a lot of people don't have time to read all things I don't have time to read and they're also so many good books out there that if you can act as the curator something to someone like not order Echo what I'm trying to do if you can curate the best book uncle has not come here he's going to podcast episode about this this is such good content and this is the sort of stuff that really helps you build your own brand as a sharer as an educator and it's a pretty fun things to do so this is where I'm kind of aiming level six but then we come to level 7 which is Dumbledore himself and this is where we really going full Ham on these metal casting method of note-taking this is sort of where I'm hoping to go eventually I've already done it for a handful of books but every time I've done it I found the exit once we've taken our literature notes about the book what we're going to do is we're going to turn them into permanent notes as indeed of a custom method or an evergreen notes as Andi Mack that is so the vibe I prefer the phrase Evergreen note because I think it sounds a bit SF and so for example I have got this database on again on Ocean of Evergreen notes and the idea behind Evergreen notes is that their notes on topics that you find interesting or sickeningly resonate with you but they are Atomic notes and write like the note is self-contained and very heavily linked to the other notes you've got in your system and the slip box Again song Karen's talks about this and how to take smartnote this is a thing custom translate to sit books it was like a method that's the German Lumen used to use back in the day and he turned out like loads and loads and loads of manuscripts and Publications and books because he had the systematic way of taking notes from the stuff that he read and so for example what I've got sections life happiness meaning what greeting luck Improvement racing Eric so all of these are topics that I'm interested in and as I read stuff in books articles podcast week whatever one going to do slowly very slowly of a time is turn these into Evergreen nuts and then having like this index for Evergreen nuts so for example you know the four important things in life. This is money love relationships mental health well-being happiness and physical health and I found this from a episode of the Samantha Ryan podcast that involves on and so I turned it into an evergreen note I link to the source and notion now has backlinks and so for example if I once I can see what links to this page so the money leads to happiness link to this page so that is raised to the note and we can see using the backlinks how this whole kind of relax together this system this kind of level 7 Vault Evergreen note this is and I'm not entirely sold on the power of it yet I can see from Reading how to take smart notes and from reading the work of other people on the internet who done this thing people say it's really useful like me personally I'm very slowly starting to head in this direction but I do I've given it enough time or stuck with it long enough to actually be able to comment on whether it's actually help me it is kind of nice away because it helps you consolidate your thinking on also the different subject specially if you have love interest it can be kind of hard to keep track of but this is one layer of abstraction above the things that you read figuring out a way to consolidate the inside of the system is very very easy to get level 5 basically you get to level 4 by following the magical inside logging framework things up here and then Fidel V all you have to do is you can use liners and play if you want we don't have to owe you have to do is just write a summary of the book in 3 sentences 3 because it for need to be concise and it doesn't take very long and just write a few words about what you thought about the book because it's the stuff that we used to do when we were in Primary School teachers would say write a book review of this this book that you read if I could give us a single piece of advice to myself well you need to just write summaries time in 20 years time you going to be so incredibly grateful that you could this Treasure Trove of knowledge inside a system other than your brain forget everything that you read otherwise if you like this idea and you haven't yet seen the video about the magical inside loading frame work with the switch is this automatic way of capturing highlights from books articles podcast and treats then he took the video of here that'll be the video about the watching you check out my notion template in the video description and hopefully I'll see you in the next video"

I want to know everything about every topic there for what do I need to do for that to take place after I explain it in more detail when we explain the retrospective and you hope to receive that that message Solstice particular problem with this standard perspective revision timetable there's no real way of seeing how much of each subject you know and it said the 10th of April I can see that okay while I studied physics electricity on the 4th but I mean do I know the topic are there any other topics in physics and there's no easy way of seeing the subject and therefore working out exactly what I need to know eating one of these time tables in the first place I always used to view this as an activity and procrastination I'd be like the K I need to get some work done you know what I've not made motivation timetable for the year yet I felt tip pen Dominguez Fenty big ass revision timetable I would never follow up some friends who would regard to revision timetable has such an insurmountable thing that they have to do before they started studying couldn't get around to you no overcoming the activation energy required to make one of these problems with the prospect of revision timetable these are just my thoughts maybe it works for you but I forgot to make your own starting a little bit more those down the main axis of a spreadsheet and this is the exact opposite of how it is with the prospect of revision timetable where we had the dates down the front so let's say it's the 4th of April and I've already studied the heart and the kidneys using my retrospective revision timetable hot Anakin evil 4th of April so now let's say it's the 8th of April and I know that I need to revise physiology the 8th of April but because I'm a good student and I'm using effective study techniques I'm not just going to read my notes on the kidneys cuz that would be a complete waste of time instead I'm going to be using active recall and hopefully when I studied the kidneys on the 4th of April I wrote down a long list of questions or I got some pot paper some somewhere right found an essay plan with essay questions this. Either way I'm using active recall I am I put the book close and answer all the questions that I previously broke myself about the kidneys what's a overall I judge that I'm reasonably okay at the kidneys but not perfect to the heart of the month of April and then having to be active recall questions that I set for myself on the previous timer start on the 4th I think you know what I'm actually pretty good at the heart so I'm going to cut and green aesthetic and I'm just going to fit in some running Bates Soho the 10th of April they were read at the time so you know what I'm going to prioritize the lungs to the question I'm going to be asking myself if the exam tomorrow which topic would I be least happy about and currently on this happy about the lungs which is why I'm going to revise the Monday April 3rd I'm going to call you because I think okay I'm now at a yellow level when it comes to the every single subject because each day we are tackling the thing that we find most difficult starting a topic because we told ourselves we study that topic 6 weeks ago we're studying the topic that we have decided we are weakest on every time we have a study session we are working on a weakest point and therefore getting the most bang for a buck in terms of revising efficiently and trying to maximize I don't know it full day today life and the others. Hopefully you look at on this I know physiology because those are my weak areas that gives you very easy way of seeing a whole overview of your subject without having to predict anything in advance because we have terribly bad at predicting the future that finally one great thing about this is that it doesn't really take any effort to get started Beyond writing down the list of every single topic in your spreadsheet that in itself is an incredibly valuable exercise because a subject can often seem very daunting until you write down all the topic that are in a cow add a great week until my exam I can repeat every single topic 8 times that's pretty incredible I can learn all of human physiology and that's a nice attitude to have rods and them being in the dark Camila I need to revise in chemistry but not really sure what your voice let me know what's in it and the specification has 85 different points of an effective revision timetable now that's how that works in real life by using an example from my University alright so is the retrospective revision timetable that I used in my third year of University that was the year that I did by far the best in I won the prize for the best example Foreman's that year when I was studying psychology which was pretty awesome and I think the reason that that happened was because I very rest of the used all of the most efficient study techniques active real estate repetition spotted diagrams flashcard I'll be making a video la today about exactly how I memorized 50 different essays to universities Masters exam set up into section a section B section c which corresponds to are three papers within psychology flexion vs. familiarity semantic vs. episodic memory and short-term memory versus long-term memory and these are kind of essay based things but and then I repeated the top one implicit vs. explicit on the 22nd and I had a bit of a gap and then on the 12th of May are repeated again and then I started color-coding it because I was like right I'm going to close to the exam now I should start cutting myself and you can see that overtime everything become green on Saturday with like the Saturday before the exam Tuesday was the Tuesday before I think the examples on a Wednesday or Thursday something like that and overtime I've repeated this topics I like the top one two three four five six seven eight seven times Google activity Equibase reputation with me drawing out my spotted dog ran over and over again until I could do it from memory on till I could basically right out any SAU gave me an implicit vs. explicit memory could psych 10 papers and I say I do because I use active recall inspection station to repeat that 7 times the point where it was green before they come and we can see if this was all about animal cognition a comparative cognition how the the thinking of animals different thinking of humans the theory of Mind future planning meta cognition do animals navigate animals understand the difference between human and animal language and finally section c which is my personal favourite was all the various things about intelligence and IQ and couples sex differences in IQ very controversial differences in IQ even more controversial and then there any genes that influence personality but 12th of May 13th of May that sort of stuff and overtime the stuff has become green because it means I know you love it so this is the retrospective revision timetable created in Google Sheets is very straightforward and then the date that you revise the topic RGB color code how well you knew it before you do take a book on along the roads on the radio there is to it so hopefully this video has explained why I think that the retrospective revision timetable is a better and more effective more efficient way of studying revision timetable the book Divergent on table that we lymphocytic get towed from a young age just summarize the main reasons why I think it's good our first date you mean you don't have to prophesize into the future because that is impossible you starting in terms of topics rather than in terms of time because it doesn't matter how long something takes all that matters is that by the end you know everything I'm going to do something today after 20 days and it helps it's so easy to make one of these spreadsheets you don't have to spend the cognitive effort of thinking six weeks into the future and try to imagine yourself at that point and how many subjects need to do instead all you have to do is write down the topics and you can just get cracking with your revision so thank you very much before we go I just want to say thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video absolutely fantastic website design and hosting content platform

            "text": " aprons welcome back to another episode of Journal Club series we look at the science behind some of the most important questions in life and they were talking about can video games be good for you for the last few years I've come to believe that video games are total waste of time optically meaningful boy PS4 to stop streaming on Twitch already wasted about 118 days of my life playing World of Warcraft and I'm thinking of getting back into it better about all the time that I've wasted and will continue to waste on video game and I want to look at the evidence to see whether there are actually any benefits of playing video games. There's also evidence about addiction and aggression and depression I'm not really going to focus on the negative aspects of the video games this video is purely to illustrate the positive aspects of video games and the various ways in which they can make you happy and healthy National skills this 2015 study from the University of California compared Gamers vs. non-gamers and they found that people who played 3D games performed better at memory top then people who played 2D games like Angry Birds split them up into three groups the first group played Super Mario 64 3D game II group played Angry Birds 2 the game and the third group didn't play any games tool and it found that in those who practice the 3D game for half an hour a day they had improved performance on certain memory process evidence that video games help improve a problem-solving ability they found that people who played most strategic video games improve grades in school the people who play video games tend to do better at allocating attention research Daphne bavelier functional MRI study into the mechanisms that control attentional allocation and she found the three areas of the brain associated with attention IED the frontal lobe and the anterior cingulate cortex those all had more efficient performance in people who play video games and people who didn't build it some neurostimulation they found that people who play video games their brains were better at collecting Visual and auditory stimulus to be able to make decisions effectively and efficiently than people who didn't play video games video games require some level of cognitive performance and therefore it makes sense that if you playing video games in real life as well evidence that video games can help reduce cognitive decline that happens naturally as we age this study from the University of Montreal is very interesting they spit up adults between the ages of 55 and 75 in one group was trained on video games ice the second group food group didn't have anything so the study found that an increase in Gray matter within the hippocampus was significant only in the gaming group where is the control group display significant gray matter loss The Tempest act as a marker for some neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and if it deteriorate over time you more likely to develop these neurological disorders so that was in the anti-aging front but there is some evidence that video games might be able to help conditions like anxiety and depression didn't use the specially-designed gamecore Spock to help teenagers who dealing with depression and they found that remission rates was significantly higher in the Box on 43.7% then in the treatment at the usual on 26.7% was significantly more likely to have that depression cured or in remission then the people who just have therapy as usual this was a specific video game design funniest joke about the social aspect of gaming now there's always leave this stereotype that video Gamers have no social skills it's kind of bad and there's some evidence that video gaming in moderation actually improves your social life this 2017 study from the UK for example example of 708 people who played massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft in fortnite of playing these word games findings revealed positive relationship between MMO engagement measured by a multidimensional measure gamer identity and online social capital that is some evidence that maybe they're all social aspects gaming and to be honest one of the main reasons why I really enjoyed World of Warcraft was full social aspect of a irons at making people from all around the world and actually the reason me and my brother bought the PS4 was during Uptown was hang out with the boys more than with someone in the same gaming session then it's like the conversation flows naturally it doesn't feel forced in stilted like a dub if you're like specifically having a zoom my plan is that when the New World of Warcraft expansion pack shadowlands comes out in November I'm going to be playing streaming on Twitch designing and coding a website and sometimes like writing videos and stuff so it's a nice place to hang out people to meet Lincoln the video description"

            "text": " play friends welcome back to the channel if you need to get my name is based in the UK on in the city of which walking about 5 quotes from stoicism that changed my life and the change the life of my friend Sam X you want to say hello to everyone on some the start teacher on the floor from Cambridge and I now have the pleasure teaching philosophy and religious studies in South London and Brake suddenly Simon I have just released a skill check laws about stoicism what we talked about the five fundamental principles and then five different domain we applied it historically to our lives to make ourselves happy and healthy and more productive this more tranquil overalls about Billington the video description if you fancy checking it out help us in our lives is from Epictetus happiness begins with a clear principled some things within our control and others are not this is the fundamental idea at the core of terrorism and we call it dichotomy of control change what I can and the wisdom to know the difference question one is just it's just like V for the middle principal shopping in Ikea and I was trying to walk around and it took so long to get around by people could have running into me bumping into me and I remembered that the teacher tools about this idea cuz if I choose to books on the elements of the situation outside my control how someone's choosing to run around then I'm going to be unhappy what I'm doing when I'm able to move forward with tranquility and of course as much larger and wider applications when are YouTuber naturally like what when you open the YouTube app the first thing you see is the LSX you see how well your video is performing relative to all the videos that you released and we all have that thing where you know if you get a video that's 10 out of 10 with me and it's the 10th worst-performing video out of your lost 10 I could have thought process I think about this quote from Epictetus. You know this stuff we cannot control and stuff that isn't until when it comes to YouTube and kind of anything that I do online the way I think about it is that the only thing within my control is the fact that I'm putting these videos out so we can do to it that's within my control under control of my team because we can basically put as many videos as we want but then the responses videos is something that is completely outside of my control how many people watch it how many people like And subscribe people smashed the like button these things are completely outside of my control and therefore I don't like the idea of having kind of like a numerical goal like a a recipe for unhappiness and the disturbance of Franklin see behind my weight loss journey I don't even remember when we were at University I was very overweight I'm in fact very low point in my life where I go up to the 322 pounds weight finding the philosophy of stoicism allowed me to rather than worrying about the comments people make about me what people would think about me to focus on what I was doing what is it to change my life and over the last three years I managed to lose over 140 lb of weight and I'm going to go to the gym in the second only he says that it is not events that disturb people it is their judgments concerning them and this is just so so important this is another one of the key principles of think that are negative caused by external events that says is that actually it's the story that we have told us elves about that event that causes us to feel bad and there's an example of imagine this scenario where a friend has had some kind of birthday like a really close friend I haven't invited you to a party and you know that and you know that have an advice to you about about it the friend invite you was because the party was canceled because they like grandma died or something like that you know that there was an external event that caused that and therefore the store that you're telling us about the events changed and you immediately feel better it's like Devon still happen getting the friend invited to the birthday but because the story of telling us up around exchange does not see me a good reason for it it just immediately take that load off my shoulders and we can only imagine that applied to that specific scenario but actually we can apply this so much more broadly despotism change how we thinking about something this can then be applied across the board The Good Fortune podcast give the examples of him sitting at bar and having a really obnoxious group on the other side of the room so annoying like I'm trying to read I don't know why he reads the ball he's making so much noise looking at the people that give me a little passive-aggressive engagement party having a really good time and that's pretty sweet that's pretty nice person trying to be hostile and trying to disturb me soon as you change that there is a gap Gap we can choose our risk this is like a thing of stoicism. The only two things without control our own thoughts and our own actions and we can choose to change the story of attending us house about things and this applies elephant from things like anger to relationships to stress to deal with all of this stuff what's the we talked about this idea that we can just change the story that we tell ourselves about stuff is there an involuntary response in the technical language Fashions by David Beckham be an involuntary response initially if there was a really loud noise outside right now I mean it would be like yeah but then we would then have the opportunity to then realized I K102 but we telling myself some kind of facial noise outside logically able to reason and tell ourselves the story that is probably just think about our response to anger like there's not much we can do about the initials reminder that we feel if someone does something that particularly your triggers us but I like after that first Clash of that first option everything else like a beast be sustained I know that we've been knew it feel don't feel is entirely based on us tell the story about it and saying oh you know that person to that thing they shouldn't have done that thing I expected to behave in that way there for the fight the debating that way means that the underbite person means think of that they are and change the story with houses you can choose to accept it and he says we suffer more often in imagination than in reality is ones where you read it right in the chest you think with the meme where there was a man look like he was drowning and then in the second shortly so he was like flow with his face just above water thinking I'm flash up because I was caught in a web of constantly overthinking back when I weighed over 300 22 pounds would regular be very very anxious about how people abusing me how people going to think about me the moment I would be introduced to someone in my head I would think that he's going to think I'm a fat person and I just don't really really insecure and it lets me actually angry unhappy and let me overeating G2 my emotions as well with the accelerated the waking up and finding this why did which have been applied in behavioral therapy in modern times inspired by stoicism has been absolutely wonderful therapist exposure therapy for example say someone has a cat food you can eat boy cats together you could put the patient in a room with some cute little fluffy kissing and they might offer a couple minutes realize these kittens on quite so bad so this quote listed so idea that we potentially want to put ourselves into difficult situations because once we go into them we might realize it's not so bad yeah Playbook Siri YouTube channel it's amazing things of a description and their home Enterprise seek discomfort it's about this idea that when we step outside of our comfort zone. Is much better well not the idea that you know next time you ordering coffee from Starbucks or whatever challenge yourself to just ask for 10% off and just see what happens and that like even thinking about that now imagining that circumstance but you know this is a perfect illustration that we suffer more in imagination than in reality like I've never done this I've never brought myself to actually off at 10% off the people who done it pretty girl until we suffer so much in a minute imagination and actually in reality it smelled so bad and this suffering imagination is a big part of why we don't do the things that we want to do like I got so many messages from people is going to start YouTube channel worried one of my friends going to think what is an employer going to think in 20 years time it's like societies like morals changing things happen yet for life without even trying it was just going to hold us back from doing all of the things and living our best lives this difficult right this feeds perfectly into the we will stay at now do stuff this difficult right Rusty 2,000 years ago The Strokes were saying this this concept of voluntary discomfort this idea that we actually want to put ourselves into difficult situations like for example having a cold shower sleeping on a hard surface this prepares us for in future if we were to be in what situations would think I face this before I can face it again I can't quite number for comes from Seneca and Seneca says if you would not have a man Flinch when the crisis comes train him before it comes and it's kind of relates to this audio results of concrete examples of this in real life for a goblin in medicine the reason we have so many simulation classes and courses and events is that you know when a cardiac arrest happens when you're in extreme if you're in this emergency situation you don't train people been doing before that happens on like a simulated scenario because when it happens in real life you want to be prepared for it you don't want to be like oh my God I don't know what I'm doing about premeditating adversity and that's the idea that we should prepare ourselves for Westgate just so that we prepared when they do come and also so that we feel more gratitude so that one example of this is something the applications used to say which is that when you're kissing your daughter or your wife goodnight examples good night remind yourself that they might die overnight or what's that thing and that's not like a movie thing it's not like a weird person who's just like fixated on the mentality of a loved one instead of someone who reminds themselves to actually you know this is fleeting my wife and taken away from me at any moment and therefore hey I should enjoy the time I have mole with them like I should be grateful for that time and secondly we shouldn't let trivial things like and I'm my wife left the milk out on the kitchen counter here from affecting us because we're reminding us add this to my end this is often like into one of Aesop's Fables there's a bull and sharpening his Tusk on a tree in some other animal comes over to him and he says why you shopping you talk that has two coming what you doing the Predator comes de los tell me beginning is shopping like I need to be ready and this was the idea of premeditation University was born into discomfort is kind of the physical manifestation is very much like logically preparing ourselves Epictetus about fundamental remembering immortality about loved ones and assembly this could be applied on alessias level say to romantic relationships people often ask how old is Derek do with a break up or they'd be upset as well but what they would have done if they probably would premeditated this is possible it is possible that this person could want to leave me at some point and what they would have done this with they would meditation and then what if it were to happen they would be in a better position at Seneca says in this quiet window this comes as big as the full would be and therefore they'll be able to deal with it in a way where they can protect the Tranquility on the final quote this is one of my favourites comes from Epictetus he says when you are alone you should call condition tranquility and freedom when you are with many you shouldn't call it a crowd or trouble or uneasiness but festival and Company and contentedly accepted tacos mute control really focuses on acceptance when an event happens you have a couple of choices you can either accept it or you can resent it now the pulse of acceptance is what leads to happiness dolphin talk about the Olympics before he was going out to like a busy area he was saying I'm not going to go to the stadium and expect no one to bother me you'll be going to a really big area of course at some point like in Ikea little kids going to run into you because they're playing around now in the mindset that no I want everything to be truthful and going to ring noisy place you basically set yourself up for unhappiness you need to prepare yourself something like this is going to happen when you alone so you can kind of reframe your thoughts and this is my time to have some Tranquility to reflect maybe work on something productive is such a powerful tool for accepting situations as they are cuz once you accept something you can then constructively move forward and amazing about the same stuff as that these guys were writing about the stuff 2,000 years ago and and get it do forms the Bedrock of most of the modern-day productivity old life advice. That was so used to saying so if you enjoy this video and more about some of my thoughts about stoicism you can sign up for free for two months products if you want you can continue it's like less than $10 a month but either way you can check on that cough and I caught like a load of other costs I with the five fundamental principles of stoicism and then five different areas in which we apply those principles specifically so thank you very much watching Sam and fuzzy blanket racism and daily quotes on my Instagram and Facebook pages not the stoic teacher it would be lovely to have you all be providing ancient wisdom from open time"

Teaching process into a cloth on skillshare isn't that fun anyway at 10:30 I sit at my desk and bust out my Northtown 1970 notebook with you as usual my morning dump which involves firstly writing out a list of three things something to focus on something to be grateful for and something to let go of today's main highlight is going to be filming a ton of iPad related footage because hopefully the new 2020 iPad Pro should driving today I'm grateful for amongst other things this apartment that I'm living in and I want to let go of the fear of Delegation maybe I'll talk about that in a video some other time after this in the second phase of the morning dump I write out all the things I might possibly need or want to do so that it's all out of my head and onto paper this takes around 5 minutes and then from 10:35 I spend some time writing up my morning Pages this is a writing method that I'm experimenting with and the idea is that every morning you write have three pages of a Fool by hand whatever's on your mind and the theory is that it helps unclog your mind of some of the junk and stress that might have accumulated technically supposed to do it on paper writing it out longhand but I tried and got annoyed at how slow my handwriting was compared to my typing speed so instead Remington was doing them on room research a somewhat fresh and exciting new app that promises to be your go-to tool for thinking I've been using room for a few weeks now and I feel like I've come to some interesting insights through the connected way that it deals with thoughts and I'm working on the moon video about this in the near future if you'd like to see a video of how I'm using room these days and how I'm learning the ropes of it it's part of my workflow series which is available nebula more details about that in the video description if you might want to check it out anyway from 10:45 I spent an hour remember I'm going to edits for video that he's putting together about 2 weeks ago he'd never added to the video in his life but then he took my skill check loss on how to edit videos in Final Cut and now he's a pro and doing some of the editing for this very YouTube channel link to the car description of deposit checking that out as well have type Shameless plug from 11:45 I spend 15 minutes reviewing a monthly favorites video that my ex related to Christian sentence and that's looking pretty small tan while I'm there just in case at noon I need a poop so I sit on the toilet for 20 minutes watching Tom Scott's latest video about YouTube copyright infringement system after washing my hands I think I done spent 10 minutes hanging up the laundry and then I spend the next 30 minutes showering ring and moisturizing as I prepared to systematically film a bucket load of b-roll footage of the new iPad pros at 1 p.m. I decide to clean the living room just generally because it's nice to live in a tiny house rather than in this pigsty with camera gear and empty box is thrown play this is what happens when my house make money leaves me for an extended.

            "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMCGdVAgGQ",
            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is Ali I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is a series of videos where I've interviewed lots of my medical student friends and ask them to give you advice about the medicine application process in this video we're going to be talking about how to answer the common question of why medicine I'll give you my take on it initially and then we'll go through 7 tips on how to answer the question from various medical students and then we'll run through three students giving answer to the question so you have an idea of what an interview on looks like can two different interviews so if you want to keep ahead feel free if you want to share with the video again you can reference the appropriate time to time so here's my medicine add Apollo to University directory no talking anymore because they know that everyone's going to pay for it and therefore it kind of makes it a sort of useless question I think the people who do well with why medicine are the ones who genuinely have a specific moment or series of moments that they can reference when talking about their desire to do medicine so I've got a few friends who spend some time and great woman straight when they were when they were kids because of health problems and that obviously contributed to their desire to do medicine and they could talk about it it's the one that isn't really really really good but me and a lot of other people that I know we didn't really have those good reasons for doing medicine we don't really have any explosions hospital when we were younger and the reason is because I like songs about how people like the idea of life I'm letting it seems like a cool career because of all the universities still off while you want to beat up that so in altering that question what I would say is don't worry about it too much I like to think of it as equivalent to how was your journey here which of the question they ask you because they want to get you into the United relaxing the swing of the interview by medicine they know that you've prepared an autocorrect Define tonsure if you have something better if you're in the position where you are Justina giving a bouncer I would suggest stopping the video right now and not worrying about it because you know we got along video we've got lots of advice about how to answer the question but I think the white thing it is to not think about it too much because it doesn't really come out to stop much so yeah but the question from very different medical students so that should give you some ideas then at the end it will do three mock interviews with different about how they would answer the question 3 times x to everything down below and I'll see you in just a moment at you kind of know that question is likely going to come up so few ideas down talk to lots of people talk to your teachers friends family and write down a couple of points but I'd say probably don't write down a paragraph that you going to recite write down a few points that you're going to walk around designs in light balance of Art and Science and he kind of wants to do is really go in half the main point and then talk about it and be able to talk about it just because you so passionate about it and I think that really shows through when you do it too much one of the main things is to make sure that you know making your own surround and then it actually applies to use specific thing cuz there's a huge number of reasons why people do to stupid so then actually you will have a real why you going through all of this application process why you put yourself through trying to get rid of good grades so I think about what that reason is for you personally but if you're going to want to get the medicine you must like science you must like solving problems probably you must have working in a team watching other people things that will probably factor in Toronto Trev one individually that's going to be their own specific reason that might being that you had a family member who you still go through a difficult time in that house in the past could be that you've had the school health problems I'm trying to think experience told you something what you saw during that time that made you think I want to be on that side while doing this side my experience was that one moment where I saw you know what this is what I want to do for the rest of my life and I told you about that moment and I think that makes it possible and anecdotal and unique because everyone's going to go in and say that they're going to less reasons and it just helps hide all together when you can actually talk about moving with didn't think of those reasons what you liked about them if you feel confident with it ready does soda make you feel more comfortable throughout the rest of the interview it is a bit cliche but if it's true for you that I so if you do just like science and want to help people then yes it's not so but it's always still unique to you so what do you like about science what particular area of helping people if you want to do so if you've had experience in helping neurologically disabled people in a particular area that you want to help people and just mention that just be specific and make it unique to you why did you like science what about it do you enjoy however you think you can contribute to helping people and continue spinning it really you just want to stand out and be different absolutely I think that the key objective is to find out that you're not just in the wrong reasons that you have actually given some thought to the question so so as I said it's okay dashiki shirt on cyst is most important that you speak for the hot especially since you probably should have a very long journey and six years of study is a long time so and has a really from the heart it's going to be boring on because that way or Come Close passionate enthusiastic and don't worry about it too much because it's not the most important questions do well on because they know that people just going to have to give whatever comes to mind and whatever original don't worry about it say something is your passion adding an anecdote or some other details to make it more vaginal if you can but don't worry about it too much myself Kenny and pull giving answers to the question pulling Penny didn't know the question was coming up so what they're saying is quite off the cup on you the question was going to go up because I made the video question how I would have gone to that when applying for medicine I don't know how I would answer it today if someone were to ask me why medicine because we go interview coming up for jobs and so on and so on Addison is because I think it's a fantastic vacation that I would enjoy for the rest of my life so from from what I've heard of a medicine and what I've seen on my work experience it is kind of always changing and stuff kind of exams to take and a thing to keep on top of new research coming out and I really like that aspect of of lifelong learning because it means that the field one stagnate means that I feel like the human component of Medicine office doing people on a daily basis and appreciated sounds you're genuinely making a difference in the lives so it's it's alive and the fact that you get involved very intimately with people that's what it medicine medicine was an it wasn't a snap decision it was kind of it was a lot of different decisions that accumulate in it started around around gcsa when a 4 hours to engineering but I didn't get to get the grades for engineering was quiet a good thing because thinking about this cuz I had to myself so I freeze on pool that's when I restart to get into human biology cuz I always been a big fan apology but I think it took me off of it was more the kind of ecology and plant-based things in the human body interesting at the start of your 12 so I thought okay at father Jesus death Iraq my Straight my personality is like I feel like I'm quiet and quite the driven person quite pricey person and a mess nothing Thursday things that you need to be so in terms of transferable skills already had met since toys he seemed a lot more attractive thought it was going to go into my experience and wanted to go events Tacoma express it Destiny certified for me I thought this apps that you brought my street and from there that's when I thought I was going to pursue a career in medicine I think that medicine brings together a couple of things which are quite important to me it provides a challenge and when I said that you know your you know your stuff knowledge you need to be able to communicate with people because so much about medicine is the personal interaction and also if you would which requires you to proceed and bring together a lot of different skill-sets and requires competence and a height of X-Men sold him so that's why I find it challenging in and a good career choice for me that's why I'm interested that was 7 tips on how to unsub my medicine and then three examples of what amount looks like I think about all of these or these interview questions that there's really no wrong wrong or right answer I mean apart from the obvious stuff that you know that would make you come across as like a bat you can pretty much answer the question however you want and as you see from the tip there are some students you think that you know it's really good to stand out while giving this answer and there are others like me think that doesn't matter if your vacation because they don't really care about the question anyway perspective about how to answer the question if you have any questions or anything at all please leave a comment down below and me or one of my friends will get back to you as soon as we can then yeah I feel like the video please give it a thumbs up if you'd like to

            "text": " when guys talk about the blog because we are taking part in the death and dying Symposium where are we actors who are trained like Cry On Demand and yeah we are going to learn the techniques on how to tell people of the dying dying and generally how to be better doctors Steve is on the CCS technical communication sales coordinator Betty is at Ulta they are there is food for you to get as much experience and exposure to these things as we can provide directions and some of the stuff we learned about breaking bad news in about dealing with patients towards end of life in palliative medicine I would do that before we talk about that can I just find out how much you can tell me about your condition very fast horror stories of doctors have no communication before going on to the woods and saying are talking to them about the next step in that cancer treatment on the patients like of what cancer has no one had told him before that they actually have time for this do situation going to be avoiding so step number one in Breaking Bad news always establish a patient's Dalton point which pool is done very well if you can I told about your condition toppings hold that my hall is another thing that's good to do while breaking bad news is it's the warning shots because what we don't want to do is to drop the bombshell of the bad news on the patient in one go kind of build them up to expect that it's coming so the first thing we can do is take me to side room and there would say that you've never break bad news when when someone's in the car door when someone's in the world if possible we going to be taking them to the side room and just the act of doing that is canoeing showing itself because the patient knows that take something serious is coming on one of the way of doing it is is to off the patient explain in your own words how their condition is it has been deteriorating of a time so for example you might ask six months ago how we feeling relative to height now and then they what kind of explain the deterioration and that in itself little to be wanting show that they would know that the case would know in themselves the definition is not improving and it's getting worse and you know we want to be getting these expectations are they so that when we do Break 5 News it doesn't come as too the price of patient with the state of you but it's going to be hot on your other health problems April is a long way away and view heart and everything else we're not sure if you feel like it so often they come back into the circle and everyone get some feedback so I just thought they workout you think they will not want to focus on so I enroll my sessions I always ask people to look out for if I'm talking too fast because that's something I have a tendency to do so we come back into the circle and we discuss with with the role player who is Dylan character on with everyone else I will we did well I would like to give you a number but I feel like you weren't ready Austin for a number and I didn't want to come just have to talk to her if you please have an issues IQ the information which would really help him boobie Tachi name the party currency that you want to be at your wedding so we should work towards making sure that you were into this wedding into for that to happen you to have a good grasp of house it is your condition is especially in a session like this where we're breaking bad news were telling this guy that he's he's not going to make it to his daughter's wedding so I think having having like a group of of friends there to kind of do it together is is really nice way of going about it I feel like if it were 121 that would be a little bit too intense maybe we do have lunch one occasionally a couple times a year but in general CCs is done that's part of group and will always take it seriously but we could also have a bit of a laugh a bit of a joke around just like and I don't make make it make it too much if if that makes sense we had to federally funded group support group and it's a spot of a safe space where you can make mistakes and yeah Matthew Tod your friends your colleagues and stuff that I really like CC especially good fun on wheels where we have to discuss DNA CPR. Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation that's one of those one of those interesting things we're technically a whether or not we do CPR on a patient if the hot dust off technically that's a medical decision I'm the patient condom has to be resuscitated but having said that we still have that conversation with them why we explain what we think is in the best interest and no take take their opinion and their tummies opinion into account so that's that can be quite a quite a tricky tricky conversation time because you can imagine if you're telling a patient that's a lot of times patients can interpret that as that we're giving up from them of that we're not going to do our best to treat them and they know the ways but like in in reality CPR is is rarely successful I think the figures are by like 7% success rate CPR is not a life-saving a measure as it can someone on Grey's Anatomy in things that actually someone has actually done a study where they looked at the survival rate of CPR in television dramas in real life on friends was a massive to start a conversation that we have to have the patience of this is quite a tricky one and that was the afternoon session with spouse so that was day one of our death and dying course we also had a few lectures kind of scattered in about treatment of patients with end-of-life about palliative care through going to come to a show of past tense me talkin about what the leaves edges were about and sharing my Michael tonight are we have two lunches with you both very good at the first one was about managing breathlessness at the same time towards the end of life experience and counterintuitively oxygen doesn't help with everyone thinks Austin helps and taking it to the evidence and it seems as if it's the non-pharmacological approaches that really do have set for example blowing a fan in your face is a far better way of relieving breathlessness then just bring those oxygen on a party drug benzodiazepines on thought useful either it tends to be more than one drug approaches that do make a difference to us and of life but sadly does the ones that require time and engagement on the part of both the doctor and the patient which means unfortunately in a lot of NHS hospitals in that much so she was just trying to get us to appreciate those of the important things II actually had was wonderful it was from this awesome consultant and Annie medicine she was talking about the ethics of end-of-life care so things like assisted suicide euthanasia and the NAACP homes in and how you deal with this conversation that we were going through some cases in the law that have kind of really shapes the way the lawyers l o s Hamilton the UK that was super super interesting so that was day one of our death and dying course even more challenging the day one but before we go there we going to have a montage to the standard epic music of Catherine cooking some Thai green curry where would we have for dinner that evening and yeah I hope you enjoy quick Montage of food oh my goodness need onions business judgment about your balance okay so hope you enjoy that cheeky little Montage of cooking my mom sometimes says that my plugs of life is Medicaid no more cooking and food Vlogs then they are medical students tough but hey filming and editing do sequences they'll be fun to look back in a few years time so now we're going to finish up this episode by going back to me from the past where I was talking about what we learnt on day 2 of the code the morning was quite interesting we were tossed with telling a patient to this was Electra patient over say that her son her 21 year old son had died in a car accident so that was super challenging because about six of us practice telling the patient and each time she responded in a slightly different way so if one of the people she broke down crying for another one she was just kind of shell-shocked side and 4/3 she was quite kind of blaming an angry and then I do that it was pretty useful to kind of get experience of that because that this whole can of breaking by the especially in the event of a sudden death of someone really young telling a mother that his son is died in a car accident that's like a super big deal to the fact that we kind of got some practice event in a final year before having to do in real life on Hangouts to be so often that we had to lecture about how do you save Kara home so there's some patients who are in the last few days of their life or last few weeks a month of the life he would prefer to die at home rather than hospitals and the point hipocrita letra made with stops in the last hundred years or so we've really over medicalized and institutionalized death and birth is well back in the day most births and deaths happen to home now most births and deaths have been in the hospital anyway when patients are protein are in the life we really want to keep him out of hospital because you know it's expensive to keep people in hospital and out of hospital patients often prefer to die at home so we were going over the various things that we can do working with McMillan s is Marie Curie hospice worker social Care Hospice a home that sort of thing to kind of make patients comfortable in the last days of Life while they're at home and then in the afternoon we had a communication skills session talking to the wife of a patient who was dying and kind of answering questions 7 scenario that I got she was asking things like Willett and I will it be in distress you can hear some rattling breathing the death rattle that is collected in and she was definitely worried about this and another one of those scenarios wife was saying that she really doesn't want to have the body of a Toyland you know we should just call an ambulance to take it away at that point we had to explain to her that actually you know it's he probably won't survive and ready to explore her concerns find out why she was worried about make it home and then use that knowledge to try and come bring around to the idea that it's okay that husband dies at home because that's that's what he wants it so I think it's something that I feel medical students are scared of when applying for medicine the idea of having to do like a station Breaking Bad News in an MMI. Like was really quite scary in from taking interviews for the last five years that's like the one station that I know every student is like reading about how to break that needs so we just have some intensive practice I think somebody useful in preparing us for the life that you need oxygen if you've watched this more than thank you so much for watching your amazing he likes ready please give a thumbs up and I will see you next time bye"

            "text": " what's the most valuable thing you've learned in your life so far I don't know how this is this is no question this possible my name is Ali I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge today I'm joined by my brother don't introduce yourself sounds great in the in the video description on LinkedIn comment is a chronic progressive movement in favor of things like procrastination to the point is to like dyed your procrastination in the right way it's actually a lot of the things that I'm quite glad I did over the Foster Conestoga as I have something important I was supposed to be doing and I was progressing from. And I ended up doing this other thing which is actually valuable and yet so I think if you have the suit of the stack of responsibilities as long as long as the whole stack is roughly valuable to do something then I feel like you're not going to do it so as good a degree as if you would like really into Avatar starting at University so it took me about four years to realize I actually don't look best in my bedroom for I have lots of distractions I took me about three years to realize that actually going to lectures is more productive for me stay home in my room and read lecture notes and do it half the time then everybody works out 19 episode 18 19 episode every week for the Loft 18 weeks on one of our episode that will link in the description is all about motivation and we discussed in depth out of techniques to get motivated but also have to think about motivation and how I'm not think about my job if you're interested motivation you should definitely check that one out how do you pull yourself up off to something doesn't go to come like not getting the grades you want for you anymore anyone can advise anyone on this is us when something didn't go according to plan it feel this way when someone no they were already with these books right I read about stoicism and they will actually cool things you can do maybe they're off like it's mostly and entitled Define your identity the reason we feel down about certain things that don't go away is because a our hopes and expectations of tied up in that thing but be our identity is in some way tied up in that thing really hard to get into a particular University and set my home address the fact that I was going to becoming a medical student and I didn't end up getting in I would feel absolutely crushed and there's not much anyone can do about that because all of the previous time that's coming up to this moment has set me up for this disappointment so what most people suggested that you diversify your identity like in an audio world or identity would kind of sense of self-esteem would wouldn't come from anything extra little it would feel to be internally generated I have value of the human being I know I'm going to be fine. I'll deal with button in real life we all have our identity tied up in various different things and I find that for me too identity of various different things rather than just on being the guy with the grades in school that's been really helpful to me with names of any one thing doesn't go my way it means to argue these are the things that I can make myself feel good about that. okay from any invoices on starting an online business I'm going to make a video that breaks down like probably in-depth phone number one is you should learn how to code and its really also helpful if you wanted the basic so kind of web design because being able to code and being able to design stuff to make it look pretty as an absolute superpower when it comes to starting an online business any other General tip I I think I might actually disagree with schools that let you do pretty much anything if you want to start like an e-commerce thing you guys never seen a lot of code you can use some Electrify even if you want to make some of it will cost them their now actually tools that let you do that without writing code so don't worry too much about the code thing I think developing developing design people like you said it's like really hard production value anything you do that's just looking to meet you at Boost when you getting started open you up to a lot more business ideas and you would have thought possible possible so the mistake that people make when deciding to start an online business is that they think you know what I'm going to sit down with my going to brainstorm business ideas ideas to identify problems in your own life that you can then solve using technology and just knowing the basics of code just opens your mind up to the Realms of possibility like what possible to make on the internet even if you're not going to be the one to fully custom Kodi a product back. I'm just saying. If you leave by saying if you want to tell them I'm busy afternoon how to code I feel like that implies a high a very Centre than reading books I think I kind of put Mike podcast into categories as this podcast I listen to so fun and Friends payment so there's one coils Conan O'Brien needs a friend code in famous American late night talk show hosts what is those kind of fun but I want to listen to a lot of like business seetaki kind of blood cause where I'm just trying to glean information and so for those ones I listen to it on like 2x speed if skipping the pauses in between using the podcast app I have two different workflows probably the one that taking one listen to podcasts so if I'm driving in the car and be like hey Siri recording your voice note and I'm driving over quota voicemail about the stuff that I listen to that podcast like a really big point I'm like oh my God stop the car on the side of the road open up Evernote and put some notes into that or open up notion I'm giving it a week for reading books and stuff when it comes to fiction I don't read multiple books I just have one that's on at the moment I'm reading about six different non-fiction books I need tonight I just think before sleeping on a candle in front of me what do most feel like reading right now and there's going to be some of that help me check out but I have to sit and read a book by cover to cover everything what I said while often do is especially if it's like a nonfiction kind of business ebook which I'm trying to get information I'll just give it like a spa skimmer and see if it's any good sea witch like sections are particular I manager read those and maybe make notes on them why I don't worry too much about you like reading HR the 18th 17th how is reading books help you in any aspect of life things that you already about business and stuff to a single thing that I've read and said all that particular things Reese will be just accumulating a wide range of Knowledge from being stuff days is where you start to think of books as if the blog post there's no kind of prestige associated with reading a book The Prestige associated with reading it instead of Puppets cover as you said but instead of skim it doesn't he want and then huh video call three books that changed my life dislike so if you just forget about that that is really good I was surprised at how much of an impact just left a couple of the ideas in this one book had on me. and the other song is always a good way to earn money depending on what you want to go into people do internships with a make money or get me a summer jobs obviously we're into the whole like online business thing so I'd highly recommend trying to set up some kind of online business that get you some kind of passive income I'm sure 24 pounds a week which was a month ago did I felt like super Super 8 I'd recommend doing something like to drink that's very easy to do and you can use your academic skills if you got those two to kind of do that with inquire after I told myself I start doing a free don't work for that you can hire out your services to random people on the internet I made a few website took a few hundred but that way when I was about mid teenagers were both really into trying to make a quick Buck online psychic readings the five bucks at fault I think I made about $100 doing psychic readings online which is a lot of money as a 15-16 year old and then you had designed development stuff where he says that the technique for doing psychic readings development investment referencing Time Financial or otherwise it sounds like he's Kindle single most worthwhile investment of my life except the game for reading books of a book A book recommendation you can eat meat if you buy it it means you can read in bed you can redo the toilet you can read Wherever You Are by using the Kindle app on your phone and it just changes the game and that there are actually studies that show the people who use e-readers read about 50% more books or something then people who don't use any readers so candle is the thing I was recommended for me it was specifically designed but really that's just alright okay I didn't know it end up like trying to do this as a job or anything like that I was sitting before my own interest in design and web sites and things that happened to Lisa went quite good so I'm really glad I kind of actually did that when I was in school interesting things and explore stuff on your own voice to the valuable stuff I've learned has not come from school or universities come from like random stuff that I'm just doing on the side for fun Stephen Perez in my time periods of my life where I have struggled I've been third year of University that was 160 dark week during that week that depressed for about a week and I think I left my room I was having cereal three meals a day at one point I paid my roommates 10lb to go outside the college and buy me some chips from a dwarf maybe I was fortunate in that respect fighting having good support network of Freddy I think one of the realizations I had was that so I had you know really good friends who you know love me unconditionally in the NFL on that kind of got me out of that Facebook yeah I always have days like this at some point so maybe I'll have it at some point but yeah if you want I'm a second PS4 network is pretty important what's the most valuable thing you've learned in your life so far I don't know that this is not a question list ethical questions for the advice that you wouldn't otherwise kind of arrived at one thing that I have been appreciating though is that everyone is making it up as I go along no one has all the answers to some but you pretty well as well you could you can say this and this is you would have had you know 15 years ago and you wouldn't be able to appreciate that this time things that show you can hear the click actually understand what they mean because anyone has told you that thing you know you you want to hear this on YouTube video and immediately gets what he's trying to say here like this the objective is not to say something on camera in 30 seconds later someone's life is changed reason and eventually when you get older you stop giving people advice money doesn't buy happiness for some people it's going to click on and they're going to have been helpful for you to say you already rich money helpful I've been using it for a few months but I think there's some weird rules around doctors recommending off license drug so I'm not last time anyone Handel's thing this back by research and it was for like to 70% of men headless thing the side effects does YouTube ads don't take my word for it don't take his what phrase for me look into this until 2. depends depends how we Define hard work and I think if you are doing what you like and work is fun then you won't have any successful 5500 for like two weeks I've been reading things about cruise ships and how they it's like the best place to get work done because everything is sold out for you your bed is made you your food is free Metra if you find a good deal at Cost maybe 50 pounds a day to actually live on a cruise ship for like two weeks. And you can use that time to just bashed out a ton of work so you can do your coding I could try and write the book you know you can do whatever you want nothing that would be a very valuable useful yeah I was sounds like a noble cultural experience like crazy kind of weird right like s*** diversity months ago but I'm not want to study data science any tips what would they do a means of all different things nowadays essentially the reason this hardly exists is I think because lots of companies now have lots of data especially if they're a tech company will have dated coming in from you know the finance department of their money coming in now. you have data coming in about your products and sell them and they're all helpful things that you can do if you unlicensed days that there was ample I become the I used to use data to figure out a way to automatically figure out the value of a house so you don't need someone how she does have a bunch of days about the house at boom this house is worth 500k or whatever so that's roughly what a DeSantis does getting into it I think as a graduate it's kind of hard because it's not as developed the field as a software engineering or other color rolls and so does not really many graduate schemes for people who just graduated one becomes a scientist the way I said it did it was to make sure I had like a solid foundation in things I needed so I studied math State University and I specialized in statistics which is very find with the cause of things nice to say scientists I also knew how to code which is really important update signs when stop in London this seemed pretty cool that needs aligned with mine company while you think your actions been working there and typically if it's like a small estas up that probably more willing to take a bet on everything garage then if it's like an established company with it very established like protocols and things like that how do I go about letting stuff from the front because you can kind of do I have not yet done any of this stuff myself so skills and then when you apply to jobs and things you can you can say all you know I've done these like how will changes I know these comes techniques and stuff so I think that's a bit more tractable in terms of learning stats I feel like in my case I just started the stuff for four years and at some point things started and that was kind of independent of why we starting at the time so I can for that when we're doing some here Bayesian inference stuff that. Somehow shed some light on some like really fundamental things I should have developed really good intuition around like really basic stuff I'm sorry I actually don't know how I'd advise someone to study stats on if you're kind of stuck at the bit before you back even the thing I was going to get you to say was just going to Google it cuz if you want it following some like online courses something oh yeah think I had this for awhile in like Tech stuff but yeah just hearing enough about this is going to make you see Roy translation get up and eventually song when I was and I was co-directing the hospital and the other co-director name is well he's like experience was a really good actor incredible singer like I've been doing this for years and years and I had zero acting movie Zero theater experience adult thinking about me that wasn't worried about themselves people don't give a toss about how I'm feeling or how I'm coming across as long as I'm being a friend going to happen during a recently okay job people can be so tied up in the room and they're on the nose thinking about me at all and I think. which game came from hearing phrases like you know you'll stop caring so much what others think of you when you realize how seldom seldom they do I'd appreciate like that internalizing that made me feel so good and then the Imposter syndrome play new tech in 2019 yes the new Apple 4K LG LG 4K I'm doing LG kind of restless by horses for wall with a bunch of other like in a equivalent monsters from like Dell and NEC and stuff that really good tonight motive Soldier things that you liked on your back and you plug into the wall not going to give you one of those shiatsu messages so that's been I'll pick you and I hope you find that useful and gained maybe something from it if you like the sort of Life at Bautista.

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hit my name is Ali Ahmad look back at what my second placement of being a junior doctor was like and that was when I was on the geriatric Ward so I've got my I love peppermint tea through first day of what DME or Department of medicine for the elderly or geriatrics like the placement of the patient with a copter F1 junior dr. Is he not my first year out of medical school for those of you unfamiliar with the system in the UK and then I'll spend the final part of the video reflecting a bit about the stuff I don't generally what the experience was like maybe talking about a couple of patients here and there a few disclaimer whenever I do any of these videos where I talked about what my job is actually like I sometimes mentioned patients but I will make it clear that one dimension patients often what I will do is I will go over to use fake names use fake genders and ages and stuff and if I do mention a patient it's not actually a real patient I'm talking about it's a hypothetical patient that I have Amalgamated from lots of other different patient experiences so that it maintains confidentiality over all the points on making will still be the same but I don't want to refer to specific individual cases of people just cuz you know this thing is is quite important essay what the actual day-to-day life of a doctor is like then you might like to watch and hugs they might be patience mostly go over the age of 75 I think our original board was a tease to mid-80s 75 who have medical problems and by medical problems problems seriously if someone had a surgical problem. Something like for example of fractured hip that needs fixing or a ruptured appendix that requires an operation yet stuff like that that requires a surgical operation to fix but often patients who are very a very frail would not be fit for surgery so for example they might have to have so much wrong with them that the risk to the surgery whatever that is what outweigh the potential benefits so often we go with will be cool conservative management will medical management someone Falls over and their 98 and their they've got heart disease and kidney disease and dementia would not likely to actually operate on them instead we would manage it conservatively with painkillers and within of plastic Austell so that cuts out oldie potentially surgical candidates who would end up on specialty surgery woods and then I think about geriatric specialty is that we cover pretty much every medical problem that happens to exist in an elderly person for example let's say we had there was an 85 year old who had heart failure and needed to be offloaded because she had fluid in the lungs fluid on the legs off and she wouldn't go to the Cardiology water that she would come to the geriatrics Ward because then we'd managed Cardiology side of it from there and if we needed to would be able to consult with a cardiologist would be able to refer the patient get them seen by the Cardiology team if we needed an opinion but for the most part we would be managing that patient a patient with patients with some neurological problems we had patients with chest infections of medical and respiratory problem may I know the patient with heart failure we had patients that had heart attacks and therefore had heart failure is as a result of those we had patients with gastro inter peptic ulcers with all sorts of problems that was coming to the mall was that they were almost a over the age of 75 have dementia something so blind eventually but things like Alzheimer's disease. Vascular dementia a fair few had Parkinson's disease as well although we did have a specialty Parkinson's disease Ward which wasn't the one I was on so most of the time I saw patients with dementia what's the time over half of our patients had dementia of one form or another and dementia can affect people in different ways for example we had one lady who was able to hold a conversation and able to remember everything you know that the fact that she was in hospital and 5 isn't all that stuff able to recognize a friends-and-family but the way that her dementia showed itself was that she had her stuffed animals by her bedside and was convinced that they were real so you go up to her and ask her how she was doing and she say I'm doing great thank you very much Talking Tom over here has been really good he's been looking off to Peter and Mildred and the other children to refer to them as her children should have them going to lay down on the bed and it was just it was very sweet I think if I had dementia if I had to have dementia that's the sort of dementia I would like to have Why by I still remember people and places and things but you know what harm does it really call someone if they if they believe the stuffed animals aspect of of Dementia in some of the patients that would manifest as a verbal sometimes the families we had a couple of patients who what admitted because they had a chest infection but you know something fatty standard that can be fixed with antibiotics but in the end up staying in the ward for extended. Of time because the families couldn't cope with them at home so that's how you got like a 90 year old gentleman whose go dementia and is being verb physically aggressive towards his 94 year old wife at home the wife has got loads medical problems heart failure can you play whatever and she can no longer cope with the behavior of the husband and then at that point when the husband gets admitted to hospital to us to safely plan the discharge play that is safe for both the husband and his wife so often and their circumstances would be referring the patient's on to something like a nursing home or at the very least we be getting carers who come into people's houses and this is an aspect of medicine that I didn't really until I did geriatrics as a specialty I'm one of the really great things about the UK which I don't think is true of many other Healthcare Systems is just how much money on how much effort we put into the whole the whole social side like if someone is in hospital and we know that if we discharged them home they're just going to have another full or something then we need to organize the carers to come in and talk to them for example there's some patients with dementia who going to forget to take the medication in that case we was it organized for carrots to come in once a day in the morning to get them to take the medication he pleaded might be some patients were around the house but unable to cook for themselves because they're there a fire hazard or whatever and that case we might organize meals and wheels like a meal delivery service organize carrots to come in three times a day to help them with their meals maybe in the morning that help them get washed and get dressed maybe a night that help took him into bed so in terms of the carers coming to the Rhone Homefront the most we could offer it was Kara's coming in four times a day some of our patients we had to Kara's coming in four times a day so this is Yung Filly costing the state quad load money but it's something that we regard as important because it would wouldn't be the case. The state would front the cost of the huge cost of DeSoto DeSoto Healthcare patient who needs 24/7 supervision because they're unsafe and it just going to have a full day of work. often do stations we end up sending to a resident residential home or nursing home where they can have carrots with a little time they'll have trained nurses that's what I think and this was another big thing that I learned on geriatrics that often would be sitting on the word I completely medically fine from medical point of view like there's nothing wrong with a massage waiting some kind of discharge planning thing to be done for them so we as a doctors would so at the medical side but then we had a whole team find us who would help so tired the social side of things so for example we had the occupational therapist who did doing assessments like the patient safety use a kitchen do they know where everything is kept all the able to watch themselves that's one thing we have the physiotherapist who'd be making assessments like 10 to climb upstairs safely I woke up and down the corridor what sort of equipment do they need help with to walk and these guys will be making assessments as to how safe the patient would be to go home and if they're not safe to go home by themselves independently then what level of care would they need and then once these guys made their assessments they wouldn't submit their reports about each individual patient to the horror of discharge planning people and then the discharge planning team will take over and we're trying to sort out the Kerasotes have the Care Homes without the nursing home all this other stuff that wouldn't really learn much about in medical school but I only really started to appreciate more of when I actually became a doctor that we could fix sometimes with with medication turn on the background of things like dementia which meant that communication was a bit more difficult and that we'd have to go through all this discharge planning stuff before we can get someone home like it wasn't as simple as for gums you give him a place to call if you give him an appointment to come to Fracture Clinic can you send them home and said it would be these patients with Rady complex medical problems and social and can AIDS and they'd be coming in and we try and sort out some of the medical problems without causing too many other medical problems and hopefully once all of that is done then we can start initiating the process of discharge planning but because in the NHS today because of the whole aging population thing that's enough for example Calhoun places available for the patients so we'd have some patience to be sitting in hospital waiting for a place to open up and two patients to be especially when your elderly and frail if you're sitting in hospital you're essentially a Sitting Duck for some kind of chest infection to take hold a hospital-acquired pneumonia and you find the longer people stay in hospital longer they're more likely to stay in hospital so we had a pretty solid team of discharge planning best physiotherapist and we do this every morning we'd have a meeting with these guys so I'm not going to talk about what a standard day at work was so I'm leaving at 6 p.m. so what was that like Renault 9 and 1/2 hours maybe a half an hour to an hour lunch break in the middle of the day so that was a standard day shift and sometimes it be uncool so it would be from half past 8 in the morning up until 9 p.m. at night so between the hours of 6 and 9 p.m. I'll bring all of the various geriatrics word sweating had like six of them so any problems that arose during the 3 hours I would be cool for words for the rest of the day I just be dealing with my own wood and at 9 we would have a team meeting with the medical team doctor the registrar who is my immediate charge nurse Toby the word cock all these different people who have these different functions within the team will get together and we go through a list of patients one at time and catch up on where we are with those patients so for example if a patient still had something medical going to be like Smith in bed a one he's got a community-acquired pneumonia he's on day three of his antibiotics we've been giving him Gray we've been giving him, and we're hoping he'll be medically fit in the next 2 days his blood test is very I've been improving his which is in the last couple of days so we're hoping to get him medically fit into the two days from now and then the Woodcock will make a note of the medical fit date 2 days from now and that would be a cue for the discharge planning seem to be like okay we should now start thinking about how does patients going to get home are they independent likely to be like okay well he he he came in when you have carrots three times a day but we don't think he's cooking with his parents three times a day so maybe we'll have to increase that to Fulton today also because he's in hospital to Kara's now stop so that there's going to be a bit of a delay until we reached we might even have to think about moving into a nursing home because there's no one else at Harmony doesn't have any support in the community so they'll be diesel to discussions about every patient in the morning with the medical team and with the the other Allied Healthcare professionals that would take us up until about 9:30 but that was a really good thing to do because it meant that we're all in the same page we know exactly what we have to do with each of the patients then from 10 until about 1 p.m. we would do the ward round and we'll drive around and see every single patient individually so in some days that would be with the consultant Mondays and Thursdays with the consultant and then Tuesdays Wednesdays and Fridays would be with the registrar so the consultant will be doing their own clinics or whatever and be available in case of emergencies but it would be the registrar who is in charge of running the world round easiest and impatient on a case of hi how you doing on the computer system and then results having a look at their vital signs from overnight to make sure they hadn't suddenly spiked the temperature which might be make sure they won't suddenly getting breathless only having a high heart rate which can also be a sign of things going wrong in the buddy so often. We would say up stable the observations or Vital Signs would be stable different infection they'll have daily blood test for the inflammatory markers so things like the C-reactive protein and the white cell count on markers of infection marks of information answer if those are coming down that's a sign that are antibiotics what are the odds we look for the blood station finder how they're doing how they're feeling you have any problems with any questions and LeBron spend a few minutes with each patient and then we go around all 30 patients in our particular wood and as issues arose we'd be writing down medical nuts all of that you know the various plans and I'd be making a separate note on my iPad for each patient as to what specific jobs I need to do so for example for one patient I might need to call Cardiology because we're having issues with their fluid diuresis trying to upload and I might need to book a CT scan because of abdominal pain and went to apply for another patient I might need to do a digital rectal exam because they've been constipated for the last 4 days we're not quite sure why we've been giving them a few laxatives but they still haven't moved my bowels at that point we don't need most I can do need update to do a rectal examination that involves putting a finger into the back passage and feeling if there are any messages or if there's any very very hard stool it does not wasn't then we can give what's go to support the tree so that is a pill that goes up and encourages people to poop because when you constipated for several days at a time that's not good it's not good for the body your blood testing because I've no bullets are common cause of confusion acutely so that was actually quite a common problem that we have to deal with pics of Dunmore rectal examinations and I've done on any other any other word since what time do we break for lunch about 1 and after catching up in the patient's enough to doing all the various urgent things that needed doing often when it comes to arranging things like CT scans and x-rays that's the sort of thing you were doing earlier in the day the CDs counters of orifice you know they've got hold you if people in the have to triage who needs a scam the most hateful if it's something something of those requests in early wolf putting request on the system and then give me a call to radiology and say hi my name is 85 year old gentleman however now he's complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea send possibly about a collage of picture because he's got some kind of history of inflammatory bowel disease would you be okay to do a CT scan 1 semi annoying thing about being a genie dogs that didn't happen much on on geriatrics but definitely happens on my surgical placement is that is is this whole issue of requesting CT scans so like 1 in the morning let's do a CT and then you are the daughter would have to work out why specifically you're doing a CT you can just all the consultant there and then but some sometimes it's a bit of a request and for the most part it recommended that if you are doing some kind of scan that you have a diagnosis in mind and the scan helps you either either confirm or reject that diagnoses but often when it comes to abdominal CT are all reason is that we really have no idea what's going on we can't find a cold then we just want to do a CT scan so the case of negotiating it with the radiologist in kind of telling them the things that you know they're going to want to hear and at the store on my first placement of dinner in Norco Play One Night in August 2018 I find it very hard to negotiate scams but over time as a become more experienced I've started to preemptible to the questions are going to ask you if you'd apparently the kidneys will the events of this about the next the radiologist always wants to know what's a patient's crashing and creatinine is a marker of kidney function so that's the sort of thing that at the start of the of my butt I know what the crap name is at the top of the head so that when they ask me if you could read Alpha me today about the we'd be doing for lunch and then we break for lunch and then after lunch would be when we can have the doctor's office getting most of the other jobs done so that would involve folding up other Specialties to get opinions dominations in prescribing some enemas supposed trees that help people open the bells in my involve for example of humanistic to do an ECG or put a catheter in and for the most part most able to do stuff on the computer so the thing about my hospitalist. Like all of the investigation so you can pretty much run your whole patient thing from a computer in the morning and we see them in if anything needs to be done in person or if we need to talk to you or if anything was going wrong but for the most part we can do all things from a computer from a phone little Bluetooth speaker right now I have my Spotify study playlist open like in the background at the doctor's office so be playing some nice like film instrumental video game soundtracks the paperwork that we had to do on the computer has a little bit more pleasant animals in the afternoon would be doing things like discharge letters and prescribing medications for pay for vacations going home so we'd be talking to families doing I didn't realize I would enjoy as much as I did and I'm really glad we thankful for the communication skills teaching that we had that Cambridge stuff for Pettis really well for talking to families for doing things like Breaking Bad News having discussions with family members where are they cleaning. Like we've we've done everything we can to feel for your relative at this point there's nothing we can do for them and I would like to keep them comfortable rather than focus on activity treating them because we don't think that's going to be in the best interests does isoplus need that I did this conversation quite well able to have families who were annoyed at certain things for example they might have complaints about the patient's previous care home in the NFL that they didn't get the right care they might have felt that on the wards they weren't given enough information so it would be down to me over and whoever whoever else was in the water the time to have you come stations in to apologize to the the families we did anything wrong with explain with the management plan was going forward David enjoyed having this conversation so that was one of the things I most look forward to about in the afternoon sessions on the job doing all the jobs because we only have the patience and always deal with and on some days the patient would be medically discharged nothing to do ready we've done all the jobs we've done all this request we don't know the discharge that is full in a few days in advance so then what's up quitting the registrar's about that love lives and how they met their partner is and how how that was going and geriatrics performance so I think the most important things was just this this appreciation for the role of discharge planning in the role of social care and how important that is in the provision of Healthcare in the NHS I just never really appreciated just how much effort goes into getting patients Kara is getting patients nursing home getting patients residential homes I'm just the Staggering amount of money that the UK Health Service spends on making all this stuff happened but equally the side of the same coin I began to appreciate what people mean when they talk about cuts to social care and custody Health Service it was just that the system was stretched to the point that we just couldn't provide a care home for people immediately and you have to wait for other people to vacate do you have to even be able to die for a care home place to become available funding if the Health Service and the social Casanova set unlimited funding you know as soon as the patient is ready for discharge they would have a discharge destination waiting for them unfortunately that's not the case the doctors didn't really need to get involved with thankfully we were folks on the medical side and we had a whole discharge planning to him about Healthcare professional behind us it would worry about that sort of stuff Bob's dementia is and I really don't want to get dementia and I hadn't appreciated before that point I don't ever heard about dementia already makes you feel thankful for Youth and cognitive power and stuff like often without patient's weed we'd be doing these cognitive tests on them so there's something called the Montreal assessments the mocha where you get the weather get a score of 30 I think 5 can you point at 6 can you tell me what these three animals are can you remember these numbers even with the patients who didn't have an official diagnosis and the patients the really sad cases were when these when they were people who had been in like had been very educated 85 and visibly frustrated that they can't figure out should be able to do it but not part of being on geriatrics and one of the Consultants that I was with the evidence behind multivitamin supplementation so often. Patients would be on Vitamin D supplements because they having the appropriate levels of old is a protective Factor against dementia so from that day on taking a vitamin supplement I was like you know I want to do everything I can to avoid getting dementia when I'm older so this really whatever it takes I would take vitamin supplements more than any others is just the importance of seeing the patient has a hole and not just tunnel vision single-mindedly trying to treat the medical problems cuz we do have some patience that we had already we have an elderly lady who had like a very hematological malignancies investigate that would be blood test maybe even do a bone marrow biopsy will be very invasive things and initially I got kind of excited this tablet and they're too old and frail to deal with the chemotherapy and the new surgical options like what's it going to accomplish by doing these tests and I appreciate the idea that we I mean while it's interesting people to test just for our own curiosity and we should always and needs to put them through a test replacement so that was between January and may between December and March to December 2018 surgical placement and then next year I'll be moving to a small hospital near Cambridge between Psychiatry and stroke medicine so for 4 months at a time and then let's going to get very interesting because then the whole world I will be tied to down two full-time employment then I can decide what to apply for emergency medicine will say anything can happen"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to the channel I can you get my name is Eliana Delta based in the UK and they were talking about how to find the perfect note taking app I've been trying to do this for the last like 10 years of my life and I've come to realize that finding the perfect note taking up it's kind of like finding someone to get another word for similarities and one key difference between the two spheres life so if you're anything like me and you stay up at night thinking about Evernote over Ocean or obsidian or remna or the other different ones and hopefully this video will be very helpful a framework for thinking about how to approach the choice of note taking out there is no such thing as a soulmate the whole like disneyfication of romance and Romanticism has lettuce to kind of believe that does that one perfect person out there for everyone that is obviously a total myth that brought millions of people out there that will be compatible with you and I for the most part and actually most of the success of a marriage or relationship comes from the effort that you put into it rather than the pre incompatibility in fact the philosopher Alain de botton compatibility is an achievement of marriage it should not be its prerequisite until just like there's no such thing as a soulmate there is also no such thing as a perfect note taking up American jumping from one to another to another like they're all different in subtle ways and they will have the pros and cons and if we're trying to find the perfect cup we're going to end up not getting anywhere at all what matters is finding the app that generally gels with your personality knowing how to use it properly annoying how to make it work for you so anyway you and the app you cannot grow together to form the symbiotic relationship has like a nice thing different types of personalities there is no one-size-fits-all solution and it's exactly the same with note taking apps and this an analogy that I came across this week on the Block neslab switch how does basically kind of three types of people in the world and three types of note taking apps to like gel with those sorts of people and that is godness Librarians an architect so let's say you are a librarian personality something like Evernote perfect for you because it's like everything has its distinct place every note is within a notebook and the notebook can be within a Stock and Two very Library like system of organization maybe even thousands of books that you will never read it. evernote's people joke that it's a right only type system that you put stuff into Avenue and then you end up not really looking at it but if you're a librarian architect type of person then maybe you'll you'll enjoy that type of organization I'm not a very librarian person myself I don't use Evernote or OneNote as my main note taking apps but I know a lot of people to do and for example geography you know Avenue is like super old it was made in 2004 it still has fantastic features that if you are a librarian sort of person that you will really gelled with Evernote you might be a gardener type personality archetypes and those people we bought apps like Rome and obsidian I rented and filled his room with one that I personally because some of my thinking is kind Gardener most and it tends to be very open-ended to do what you want and as a gardener uses heading to your collection of notes overtime without like a clear organizational should have rigid structure behind it so it forgotten something like Evernote would be way too rigid because it forces you to think in certain ways and a gardener doesn't want that alarm I kind of want for the blank slate and build their build a garden from the ground up and that's the kind of thing that room is really useful. If you have that sort of personality you might like to give those ago the architect personality type which is probably the one that I fit into most and that is where you kind of want things to be organized and you want to build your own structured organizational system you don't want to be pigeonholed into like a rigid hierarchy like Evernote and OneNote for 42 but you also don't really like just the Pure Freedom that a gardener act like obsidian will give you and that's wearing up like notion video was nicely because as an architect in my mind I can cut a design my organizational life operating system however I want it and if I want I can be rigid with two notebooks or if I want I can use the database peaches databases I can do whatever I want it's my blank slate but it's not so kind of free-flowing network he has stuff like room is and that is why I use notion most of all for the stuff that I do because it kind of gels with that side of my personality and so just like wood different personality for different people it's the same with no taking apps and so when I make a video about using bro people in the comments I switch my life did you find one that fits your personality rather than you say oh my God in Ocean that's where I have to switch my entire life of its motion that's not really the best thing about it when it comes to marriage and getting a divorce is messy and expensive I'm with switching note taking out like let's say you've been using Evernote since 2005 for the last 15 years and you've thousand thousands of notes on Evernote if you would suddenly decide cost associated with. It could be messy and it's going to be expensive it's going to require you to put some energy into learning new systems understand how it works and you better decide for yourself is the switching cost actually worth it based on the new features of the app it would be like kind of having a marriage where but you quite happy you know otherwise you got some kid you couldn't even build a life together and then this hot new secretary comes along and you think you know what do I want to switch my life but I'm saying that you want to think twice before just jumping ship willy-nilly and so yeah don't think that you have to switch to a note taking app just because there's a new one on the book think about the system that works for you and it might be time for you which is the benefit of switching to notion of Rome over rice the value that you built up in an app like Evernote but there is a cost of switching and we do have to keep that in mind and 1/4 similarity between relationships and meaningless sex is ultimately unfulfilling or so I've heard people say that a lot of the value of a relationship comes from the investment that you put into it rather than from screwing around and moving from one person to the next person to the next but then because that ultimately doesn't really need any way you can spend you're one of those people that you know shiny new toy syndrome you're chasing off of that know anything and you know one day using Evernote the next week using notion then he's looking to run any switching to obsidian and then you like trying to find something else I just mean like who this is a shining mutoid let me try that out but actually think about the point of a note taking app it's so that we can take notes for ourselves to help running and creativity organization and so we can convert those notes into outputs because the point in US holding our knowledge internally formatted is that we're sharing it informal if you just going from one up to the next to the next to the next in pursuit of the perfect. find because there's no such thing as a soulmate doing anything useful but there is one crucial difference between relationships when it comes to relationships polyamorous relationships almost never work out like it's really hard to make them work in fear you should work but if you read accounts from anyone who's tried them for the most part it seems like it's really really hard to take slug communication it takes a lot of emotional resilience to make a polyamorous relationship work and the difference between us is that it's completely cool make a polyamorous relationship work with note taking us there is absolutely no need to find one app and only one up that you're going to use for everything because different apps like we talked about. Pros and cons of different ways of thinking find Evernote and draft a combination of those for for my various note-taking Ace Sesame Evernote forms like the base long-term memory layer of my system I kind of chuckled resources all the PDF so the receipt so they kind of corporation tax build I use Avenue as my set it and forget it falling system because I understand that whenever I want like if I need to get my company corporation tax number I know I just need to search corporation tax and Evernote and it will somehow find it using the optical character recognition it will what text is an older PDF that I stored equally if I'm suddenly researching a topic like I was researching membership sites the other day and I found this is the easiest place to save all that stuff because set the web pages to Snip-Its to everything where it sounds like Roman notion you have to do a little bit more hacking to just allow them to accept absolutely anything until Epiphany Evernote is the base layer of my note taking system then we kind of like to see personal notes so I tend to use the Rome daily notes feature to just kind of take some notes of my day I tend to use room for taking notes on books and podcasts and videos I've watched because I find that the bi-directional linking structure of Rome is really nice but I still under use run maybe 10 time and I find that over probably about 80% of my time is still using notion because I'm frustrated architect personality and said that looks to me but also because notion has a lot of team collaboration features that locks and therefore if I'm pretty Picasso whatever that stuff is now done with my team of people who help me out with self and so it makes sense for us to use notion as a central source of Truth everything because notion is so full-featured you can kind of create whatever organizational system and so we've built around system for dealing with a video pipeline for the Imani's data pipeline pipeline we have all of these different workflows and different pipelines for dealing with different types of content and that's the stuff that room is very difficult to work with part of the team doesn't really give us the flexibility to have a kanban board and have like to do this and all that sort of stuff so you know I'm in a polyamorous relationship with notion room at Evernote and I use Drops just a quick capture like if I'm driving Podcast Addict take them into the draft app on my Apple watch and the reasoning is dropped because it seems very nicely with the API with Evernote and it's very least used dictation feature and it loads very very quickly take us to load an Evernote is really slow and Bloated and therefore takes ages to load so I'm in this polyamorous relationship with these for note taking apps and that is how my personal system is built but that's not to say that you have to use all of them you have to use any of them the point is that when it comes to description of thing that depends so much and a personality depends on what we need to get done and hopefully evolves with us of the time it's not something that you have to get perfect from the get-go it's like a relationship in terms of thinking about not taking out here or bother videos where I talked about how I use notion Evernote room and dropped and various different ways you can hit the link in the description to sign up to building a second brain which is the online course digital note-taking system is built on and I'm a mentor in that cost if you sign up for the light Cobalt II then I will be mentoring you unlock Zoom calls over the next level four weeks"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel about my favorite productivity a pop 2019 and that is an ocean and I've been using notion every single day for the last six months and it's completely supercharged my productivity and creativity in a way that no app has ever done before in three parts to give you a brief introduction to what notion is and why you should use and we'll do a quick run-through of what the main features of the airport so I can show you some of the built-in template for students but also for non-students that'll help you get started in the final show you a little bit about how I Tuscany's notion to organize all the various aspects of my life as usual timestamps down below and comment to feel free to skip around the baby feel like it for now and what would a Content management system which is sort of the behind-the-scenes system of what people used to build website and it kind of hard to explain what notion actually is because I just do so much stuff all these have a distinct structure that they force you to use so for example notebooks and then notes with a notebooks and maybe you can have tags or you put dividers in folders in the notes for the point is they give you a very rigid organizational structure structure or hierarchy you can pretty much create whatever system you want for organization and productivity I think about it I'm more like you know buying a pre-built house or renting a house we're at the structures already in place you just putting your stuff it's like you're building your own house and you can build with whatever building blocks you want it and then once you set it up then you can just add and remove and change and what if I bits whenever you like and I'll give you a brief overview of what nursing is actually like what starts with a workspace and it workspace inventively name Minnelli's workspace workspace you got a series of pages and that is pretty much the extent of the araki let's create a new paid within this work space and let's call it an Alexa making notes for Miami my medicine exam medicine doctor icon in there looks cool find something to do with medicine school and so this is my medicine patient you seen some of the ocean in this kind of goes back to what I like to call the value of July 10th just such a delight to you you can have these little icons you can have these cover images it just makes all sorts of notes just look a little bit nicer and anything that makes no taking organization of productivity and what the life process is one that therefore going to be encouraging me to use it more and not something that I'm going to be wanting in my life how to record a few subjects will go for Cardiology will go for a no renal medicine will go for neurology and we'll go for Respiratory just for example the Great Notion is that anything can become its own page so Penn Cardiology into a page by clicking the button turn into page two different options heading 1 heading to heading 3 but that's turning into a page and now this becomes clickable and now suddenly are going into my Cardiology page and I can do nothing I can do whatever like my Cardiology page so I said I don't like calling let's make it an icon of a broken heart because that makes sense that's out of cover images for vents so I'm going to use let's find something to do with hearts about that one great song, Cardiology paid and I can put whatever I want into it so let's name a few conditions we got atrial fibrillation so just a few random examples of 111 Freddy's pages and so what I can do now turn into page now go separate page rape relation I can do the same thing for heart failure I can do the same thing for my card and function and just lets me convert whatever I want into a page and so this makes it easy to set exit of high Rocky and mine organizational system and one thing I can do is I can insert a breadcrumb for hitting / breadcrumb and what that does is it in it tells me where in my notebook So within medicine were in cardiology here so we could cook it back to Medicine I need your back to medicine with a Click by A cardiology Cardiology that's a relation and again I'm just going to add an icon there I'm not going to bother with a cover image cuz and then and now we've got medicine cuddled every formulation so at every level it's this is almost like we're designing your own website Iron web content management system but it's just that there's none of the effort that actually goes into designing website and so you can pretty much structure at 5 play I'm going through something by interpretation so we just go to Wikipedia and cooking pay stuff into notion let's grab it from Wikipedia so at the moment we're within a page and old is have content blocks inside them and blocks is the primary to the feature of hierarchy of notion server example if I pasted this text in this whole thing is a text block and what I can work with that I can either do or standard formatting thing board underline but I can do other interesting things of that stuff for example if I wanted to take some of it I can color it I can give it a yellow background for example to make it stand out a bit I can create separate text 11 so for example to call out element looks like this that's kind of cool something goes here and again we can just modify the colors we can change things around that kind of looks cool we can move stuff around the whole page we can add heading so let's what is a heading ski and then just picking from whatever you want so that makes it quite easy talk to input stuff by easily so let's go image uploader embed an image so that's again funding from unsplash just cuz built-in list example another time we can build up our page into whatever we wanted to be in a way that they just run them placeholder content but you know this is your own productivity system your organizational system Euro note taking system you can do whatever you want with it now has five content blocks and everybody's breadcrumb we got this text we got ahead and we go to call out and we put this image that's five blocks of content I don't know Shinto free plan that anyone can use gives you 1,000 free books to play with you can get started with that a personal plan then cost $4 a month but recently they got this new student found so if you have a door AC or. Edu email address you got a personal problem completely free and so you can then use unlimited block storage and I've been fun if the person plan for the last like 6 months and I've used probably thousands of this point but there's no limit to the Fest on time so it's a deal. It's free if your students are definitely what download Roblox we can pretty much do whatever we want with that all of this can be a little bit overwhelming special that's why I know she comes with so many pre bundle templates that you can use and customize Harvey like that's what we going to be talking about that so yeah templates stop and Mac OS app that shows you or the templates that are available for notion so you can see they've got like absolutely tons of days for pretty much any use case must have also that say you're designing a road map you can do it like this user research database design tips meeting notes I quite like the postal templates of reading list you can make reading the stone ocean and over here we've got these Cola elements and here is the database feature so this is another really big toe and I want really talk too much about in this video but there's going to be another video coming about that but you can use the database before notion to just organize anything into pretty much whatever format you can imagine for the one that talked about here all this student an educated templates that they've recently released and these are a ton of templates. Well unusual for students and Educators set a tablet for students we buy cars no template and within here we go to the stable database. You see we've got this review Tech Mark that we can take if we review the content we've got the and this is a page so we can open it up into its own little section said that talkin about kazuo ishiguro name Rings a belt on a Hula's How it Go with closets and what type it is we can we can reference different materials week what dates and we can fill to stop to just include whatever WinCo job applications to help you try job applications we've got the reading list again Waco grade calculator thesis planning Cornell note system personal CRM CRM is like a customer relations manager this is like how you can keep a track of the people that you need C4 the name Hugo their associations family Google College lost updates that has contacted so you can just make whatever you want is the Cornell notes system anybody seen some of my evidence-based study tips videos is easily the most efficient way to get information into your brain until the audio behind the Cornell note-taking system instead of just taking notes you're also writing keywords and questions Elf on the side cover Golfland notion of the template we can write the notes over here so we can say I don't know so print out some notes about atrial fibrillation which is a cardiac supraventricular tachycardia on the right hand side on the left hand side I'm going to write my recall keyword so over here I'm at right management options for air and that when I see that not looking at the notes but then I would force myself to recall what other management and then next to this one I can write what are the options for rhythm control and then when I see that's not looking at my notes I can think about what are the options of Rittiman troll okay we can use medicine like second I don't know we can use DC cardioversion what temp to see that there is this a summary section on the bottom this is another part of the Cornell note-taking method it's useful to have a summary at the bottom of the note that summarizes the important stuff and also maybe even and so will you can use if you can create a cold outside we discussed cold outside then she needs to wait for you come to the stand out a bit and just make your note to look a little bit prettier so I could write a summary atrial fibrillation is a and so got my notes in the whole page of writing my summary and this is how we Cornell note-taking method and then what motion does it give you the template and you can just duplicate this template however however many times you like and you can customize it to your unlocking so this is a nice sale starting point for a standard note-taking template do the weather for downloaded on iOS or Android or iPad whatever you find absolute tons of templates that you can use on the Zolo the free template to even get off the internet so if you like how other people use notion and have their notion set up you can usually download that templates and you can adopt them to you so that was a quick look at some of the student defocus templates an ocean and just as a reminder if you are a student with a do ACO. Edu email address you can get notion completely free of charge otherwise it cost $4 a month but to be honest it's the best I ever spend on any software ever okay so here's a look at some of the ways in which I've been using ocean for the last 6 months to organize my life and I'm just going to show you a few of these studenteve related stuff I used to love the other things but that would be the subject of future videos so I can medicine I know here I've got this database structure so I've got a table that has all of the very subject in my syllabus and so let's have a look at in urology for example so I'm going to open the page and I've got neurology and what I've done is I going through the neurology syllabus the textbook very sources and I figured out what all the topics in neurology are and this is what I like to call scoping the subject because it makes sense to have a skeleton structure of the subject in our heads before we didn't start learning an individual thing Leeds muscles infections degeneration Mile and cranial nerve spinal cord headaches for the movement sodas near examination end of genetic stuff and this pretty much covered everything I need to know if in urology and then within those boxes but I see that's fine one that isn't empty so within muscles we go nmj Wisconsin during muscular Junction and then within that week but my senior gravis and lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome which are each diseases and then Within what I'm going to do is overtime I'm just going to be writing out questions to myself if it's a topic that I'm weak on and sew in an Ideal World what I've been doing is once I've finished revising Urology I would just look through this list and think okay what do I know about strokes and I will get my pet out and just active recall everything I know about Strokes holding phone stuff onto the page and I would do that with every single thing so then I know the oldest content is in my head and then what I've done is Armada like undefeated he's just to add a little bit more personality to the thing so I don't know if I was looking for non-compete degeneration old degeneration from pretty confident Confidant but I don't know nerve nothing neuron rain final coat mine is not an emoji backpack backpack did you get the idea and this just makes studying much more fun colorful emojis how to use anything was more excited to yours is going to encourage us to use it more and that's good when we're trying to study over to be productive and then if I show you my clinical hematology and oncology page within that objective written some questions so I split it up into red cells and platelets ocean and white cells malignant stuff and so Within These Uncle these various categorical hierarchical organizational systems BSA as you can see I've spitting up more and more into these knowledge trees that helps me remember what is in which category and this is just another way for G6PD deficiency glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency what causes what caused the crisis which drugs on the jet we diagnose it none of Hayden my notes on this particular topic underneath one of these total points and that is all these notes that I've got from this copied and pasted from a? On the internet but the point is what I'm looking at this see my questions first and that means I'm full-time forcing myself to active recall so then when I have forced myself to active recall I can look at my notes and then I can read whatever I want and this is just a few different ways that I've been experimenting with various note-taking features of Note Pacific pay for student related stuff but as you can see if we just have a quick look through this I use it come out of my email newsletters you can subscribe to manage my video that uses my weekly review my view I use it to manage my online courses are you there figure out content for my website and I used to telling my team I keep track of my ideas I have this like life Wiki where I share my thoughts of organize my thoughts around creativity organization protiviti all the stuff that I care about I use notion to lug yeah well I do at the gym which I'll explain a bit more electron is it to keep track of ideas for making money that I've got to keep track of podcast ideas as residents calendar thing that animals using it for things like planning out my book reviews and call Kaiser various various disguises. I'll definitely be discussing in for the video so it's free to use the first a thousand blocks you can just play around with it down at some templates figure out if you like using it probably well and then if your student you can just upgrade to the postal package complete and I've gone so much more value out of notion than the 4th of this month that I've been paying for it for the last 6 months"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the log on to another study with me video that's David Feherty chill day we just the way I like revision to be I've always thought of taking it at allegedly Pace during birth to active recall inspector position to maximize efficiency for not being overly concerned with 100% productivity hopefully you'll see that we got a lot of work done but be it settle Zac white chill at Funtown. Ossipee including 10 study productivity tips hacks things that we use throughout the day so hopefully you find those useful anyway I work at 8:30 a.m. lay in bed for about 30 minutes doing absolutely nothing / present YouTube from 9 to about 10:15 I was editing and uploading one of the revision Q&A videos of the shower and this is what number one one of my productivity hacks as it were normally I have a shower first thing in the morning to wake me up but if there's something specific that needs doing that I imagine will take our less I jump straight into it and then I use the shower afterwards as a soda break from 11:10 to about 11:30 I'll spend some time to hide in my room telling my desk packing my broken drone to send it for repairs that will be more on this when I put together the blog about Singapore and Bali this is another trick that I use before settling down to work I make sure that my room and my desk atayde yeah it does sort of waste time in the tithing face and I guess you could see it as procrastination from actually doing the work but I think the overall benefits of having a toddy room and clean. all better for my own mental state then trying to squeeze out that extra 20 minutes of productivity at the expense of a Hino nice room with good feng shui as it was after that the work session starts because I don't like having a revision timetable at first need to decide what that actually didn't I think too much if we have the exam later today what topic would I be least comfortable with I saw it. If I had to take a history from a patient with a psychiatric issues like depression or anxiety or suicidal ideation or Mania bipolar disorder I don't quite remember that so I spend the next hour or so getting my head around that turn it off do something for example Beck suicide scale I want to write down for memory exactly what I learned this is point before this is active recall in action there's nothing fancy about this I just like using different colors and arrows and I'm taking things out on the page who gives me more recoil cues for example at some point if forget the Beck suicide scale it might help me jog my memory that I remember writing down the three components on the right hand side of the page of green that I can remember all yes there are three components and thought Q's my Rico Love oh yeah those component components one number one planning the three what happens after this is why you different color than the iPad makes this super easy but to be honest even using different colors for years even with paper full so it makes you know it's a bit more of a pleasure to look a bit more work if I be feeling like nice when he died cuz I'm there's no understating the importance of that my friend Catherine and then spend the next Psychiatry history role-plays putting into action the theory that we did that and I act like an asylum-seeker from abroad his family was murdered by men with machetes and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder I've got my asylum-seeker hearing the following week and I've taken an overdose of paracetamol because I know that if put it in my home country so I might as well end it now Catherine has to talk to me or ask about my symptoms and assessment suicide risk to work out where we go from here we can swap roles as she acted the young lady with a past history of sexual abuse from a partnership and homeless to the past two years and her dog has just died best place to rent a spirit of depression she's come to the GP practice with the social worker and I'm acting at the gpn trying to talk to her about what she's been going through so we so that we can make an action plan from 2 to about 2:50 p.m. I make lunch so make my you combination of pasta with tuna and pesto and Andresen static peace because that increases my green vegetable intake and not to revolutionized my lunch at around 3 pm pull and Alex two of our other friends come up to the kitchen and we decide to do some work we go over the thyroid acromegaly and the crushing the combination Toledo tattoo phone number 5 is that pull sat down and was like what guys let's go some examinations how about we do the thyroid he's taking lead he's making us do work and the rest of us we're sort of in this inertia mode where I will we're feeling a bit lazy but if someone comes along and says black guys were doing work let's do this this unless then was quite happy to come and go to that is important that whenever you doing a work session with friends at least one person needs to take the initiative and tape record between us and everyone else will follow if you don't see yourself taking to leave without sort of thing because you feel like you're not. So the person that just sort of takes the date I would really employ you to work on that leadership skills also important in literally any workplace environment especially medicine you know it's a good way to practice the skill in a chill sitting with your friends rather than if the first time when you're in a cardiac arrest and year of you and you're the most senior person on the team is something that we do in the cell section as well and that is the same that active recall is a way of life instead of pull just going over the third examination and us being like yeah that makes sense when you that Serving Spoon fat one of us says actually can I talk you through it myself and you fill in the gaps that I missed in this example I had done the third examination a few days ago and I forgot some of it but that's fine because that's the perfect state to be in in order to active recalled because when you've allowed I forget something and then you're retrieving it that strengthens the the connections and not thinking it would have been much easier for pull to spoof spoon-feed us the Examination for the thyroid or for us to read it in a book and then be like in power Chocolate Fest without looking at the notes without having it explained in fonsa is going to strengthen the memory ultimately that's much more efficient anyway in the session we draw diagrams for the acromegaly man and the machine's man this is another 4.7 learning by diagrams diagrams DeSoto based on what I previously said about suing recall and if you can cue a Ricola Vector anything based on images colors position on the page these are all things that you can use to your advantage to maximize your efficiency and because I could recall his way of life putting them right that we encourage all the time to record so far gone by founding the actor Michael examination and I'm trying to remember all the details were and I remember that they were five things in the sentence I would say to my friends like right guys don't tell me don't tell me I'm going to get this very hard to think about what those five things were the idea that the more take this most strongly that members going to get encoded right so that's done from 4 to 5 p.m. I decided I've had enough and do some piano practice sight reading Factory which is generates random pieces for you at your level to the ER Tyler Henry music Allen spend some time catching up with the tech news. and reading about what happened at Mark Zuckerberg Congress hearing from 5 p.m. till about 6:15 p.m. I go back into work mode and I have the cardiovascular examination to my active Rico spreadsheets are in one column all right questions that could come up in the exam and in the second column are right answer to those questions are there color the second column and white so that when I'm looking through the questions I can't see what's written on them this is why I like Rusty having a big widescreen monitor and secondly using online / PDF versions of books rather than physical books it's much easier to do a split screen when writing these questions yourself 9 this is my magical spreadsheet active Regal system which I've alluded to in this block which will be linked above and below and everywhere I was going to magical spreadsheets face recognition system which again you can read more about in this video or the video link below the from 6:15 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. Catherine come to my room any and she asked what we should do I decide to follow .5 I decide to be a leader so I offer the opposition I say or I Catherine I'll just Randy's cardiovascular examination questions why don't we go over them so we sit at my desk and go through these questions together I'm disappointed attempt this is something more by activerecord when it keep going on the back to Rico's it's literally the most efficient way to learn anything ever what we do is that I read the question out loud and then we both stay silent while we both brighten L2 down / think about what the odds would be only when we're both ready do we look at the onset of this means that while we working together we're still having to use our own brain and our own active recall to get the answers we're not just passively piggybacking on what someone else is doing which would be a really tempting pint by about 7 p.m. we're done with work for the day over we'll just on the four hours until but I think it was full pretty productive hours because it was mostly built around activerecord spaced repetition in the pasta might have been tempted to read my textbook make notes from the textbook etc etc need help I could have been like eight I was doing the same topics that because making notes and reading textbook is so so so inefficient I think I would have learned less than I did in this full quite efficient hours then from about 6:45 to about 8 p.m. I feel the intro for one of the revision Q&A videos Catherine help me set up the lights kind of her an expensive time editing this video at 8 p.m. we order pizza from these which is a favorite like pizza place in in Cambridge there from about 9:15 but he tied around 10 p.m. or so to go to the gym to burn off those calories. I just ate the pizza into a quick session of squat overhead pricing while listening to the audiobook for the wise man's fear of the sequel to The Name of the Wind which I talked about in my think my February favorites with other than get home get into bed around eleven-thirty spend an hour playing tonight, so you guys have been sending it on Instagram and then pulled at nights I hope you guys in Play With Me video and let's make the best of Eurovision see you in the next one she liked video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribe to the channel to listen to the dang so have a good night"

            "text": " a friend's welcome back to the channel in this video I'm going to go over 20 life lessons that I learned in 2020 has consulted the first one is from a blog post by Paul Graham cold the top of my to-do list and it comes from a book called the top five regrets of the flying and list of top five regrets is in a particular order number one I wish I had worked so hard number to I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself not the life others expected of me number three I wish I'd let myself be happier before I wish I'd courage to express my feelings on number five I wish I'd kept in touch with my friends so given that we know that these are the top five regrets that people have when they're on their deathbed these are all mistakes that is very easy for us to fall into by default on a full gram says in the blog post the eye way for us to avoid those would be to change our default but in the absence of completely changing allies around there is an easy way that we can remind us of those and so will pull does which I have to do is write these five Commandments at the top of my to-do list don't ignore don't work too much say what you think cultivate friendships and be happy so that is now at the top of my to-do list and whether I'm doing it to do this in the ocean or or in real life I always try to remind myself to have those five things at the top and secondly I really love this year that to me if I to grow as a person I need to lean into doing the things I'm scared of Orlean into the fair this year a publisher and seems like a very very very everything I was on the verge of saying no I don't feel qualified or no I'm not I'm not good enough to write a book about about whatever and I have this feeling of fear and I already analyzed qualify to write a book and it won't be here for me anyway and all these things invoice I'm too down to was I was just really scared I did not like if I were to write a book I didn't want to be bad that he wanted to get negative reviews I was scared and as soon as I named that feeling of fear I knew that I have to say yes and do the thing because leaning into the fair is how we grow as people and usually it's me I found that if I'm scared of doing something provided that something is not physically putting my life in danger if I'm scared of doing something that is a very strong indicator should be doing the things moving for what I may be writing a book and I will tell you more about that later if you want to find out more about that description and you will get more details about which is the difference between how to and get to and this is just a mental mindset shift that completely changes the game for me at least when it comes to thinking about how I have to do stuff and I remember there was one real moment when I was I was at work and I was an evening shift just approaching the end of my shift and one of the nurses came up to me and said this patient needs a Kenya. So you know intravenous access to put drugs in and then I realized that I was feeling a bit disgruntled about doing this kind of that because I was thinking about it that I have to do this and I remember the blog post that said Golden Road Star which talks about reframing things from have to to get to I have to do this kind of that it's I get to do this Connie Le and just a mindset shift just changing the framing of it in my head made me realize like you know how appreciative and grateful I was to be in that position where I had the privilege and the owner of putting a needle in someone I'm strictly doing it in a nice way and told him to them and eating them through this process and instead of thinking to do this at the full my shift ends I thought of it as I get to do this in this is awesome I was just that thing just a little change that completely changed the way I approach that situation hope that for a letter better experience for the patient over old and now when I find myself being like procrastinating from something with thinking you know that feeling of all I want to do this I switch from I have to do this to I get to do this and that always helps me is a very simple one I really struggle with waking up in the mornings like I have my phone across the bedroom for me so I have to switch off the alarm I recently realized that I could just ask Siri to switch the alarm off so I didn't even have to get out of bed until 1 like mental Hack That I Found help myself actually get out of bed it's okay to get back into bed and I'm allowed to sleep but I have to have a shower first and inevitably want to have a shower and sing a few songs in the shower and stuff I feel like fully awake and energized and Revitalize and I don't actually want to go back into bed but shower helps me how to trick my brain into letting me get out of bed so I thought that was an idea what's your lesson number five is that I realized this year that my information diet is not very good information. I mean the books I read and the podcast I listen to and the audiobooks I listen to because I was I was looking through my list of podcast I'm subscribed to and all the 69 of them like 65 of them was something do with business or Tech or entrepreneurship or like creative type stuff only one of them was related to health that only one of them out of the list of 69 was related to relationships and given that the most important things in life are helping relationship above things like business entrepreneurship Tech creativity like that while I'm really not putting the focus and effort into improving my health improving my relationships. I really should be doing because one of the point of listening to 65 business podcast when I still eat like unhealthy takeaways everyday and actually we just ordered some fried chicken for the evening what's the point of listening to 65 business podcast about how to make my business grow if I'm not putting even a modicum of effort into my personal it's whatever you the thing that is going to lead to long-lasting happiness and so now what I'm trying to do is reshape my information diet so that it reflects more what my priorities in life actually are or what my priorities in life I would I would like to be like focus more on health and relationships rather than business and so I'm trying to shake the tight around and actually does a great quote that has a thousand wishes and has only one I started thinking a lot about the components of an ideal life and I hadn't really come across the floor framing before until I listen to a podcast I think it was a Samantha Ryan Show where Annabelle Robert comes with being interviewed and she asked him what are the components of an ideal life and he said that while most people would say that it's this fool things in an ideal life number one physical health number to mental health happiness mental well-being that stuff stuff number three relationships and number four Money / work / you know putting a roof above your head to dump some stuff and so I reflected a little bit again I realized I was so just like always so focused on the kind of money career Financial Independence freedom thanks and kind of neglecting the physical health the mental health well-being happiness type stuff and also the relationship types of so hearing it framing that way has kind of made me appreciate that I gave you the four important things in life and at the moment you way too much there was one of them and I need to be giving more effort to the other three that's what I'm going to be doing hopefully from the new year on what's an actually there's a second quote from this episode which is the audio life would be one where you had a hobby that as a byproduct made you money puppy that has a by-product kept you healthy and you had a puppy that has a by-product made you smarter and more creative and that's like another way of thinking about how you know what would a good life be so what does it mean as a by-product makes me money so that would be this YouTube channel next and I think it also makes me smart remote creative and a hobby that has a byproduct keeps you healthy sofa me sort of that's going to the gym but actually a lot more for me it's playing racquet sports like tennis and badminton in squash now I'm starting to take this Farmington Mo regularly with friends and I think she can have those puppies that fulfill these different criteria that is another way to Nadia life as an evolved for this year and what really sealed the deal for me was in the first lockdown in March of 2020 I decided hey you know I mean it's my dream to become a gymshark athlete and go to the gym so why don't I do some homework house and I kind of did it once or twice and I just kind of fell by the wayside and then I was doing a fitness and we were talking about like physical health goals and he clearly knew a lot about physical health so I said hey can you be my trainer the oldest thing was I was just a little bit of accountability has created a Google sheet for me and they should put into notion that was a workout plan and he told me what macros I needed to hit, I was just meant to track them on MyFitnessPal and send him a screen every week and just that little thing just having someone to hold me accountable even though this person wasn't anywhere near me was living in like matches to help North or something having someone to hold me accountable made me really make progress on the homework out front and also on the health in front at the time since realizing the huge power of this accountability stuff I've not been looking to hire coaches to work with me on all sorts of different names because I realized that in the past I used to think of it like hey I want to learn this thing or I want to get better at this thing that for figure it out by myself and that was totally okay but I had something from the time of my hand and nobody but now that I have you know that I feel I have less time on my hands and more money thanks to this YouTube channel of my other things it's now a total no-brainer to take tennis lessons tallest guy doing all these things recently and most of that to be honest is related to the power of accountability next we have the life lesson do what you're doing and this comes from a very good block cold rattitude where the author David references book from the 1990s about spring cleaning in a spring cleaning oven cleaning your house Authority pay attention almost everything else will fall into place if you do don't think about revisions in the text code nothing else and Latin all gay quote do what you're doing and you know this is fantastic life advice from this book about spring cleaning a house because in his book about spring cleaning they say that look when you are cleaning the sink focus on this thing of cleaning sink when describing the door scrubbing the doors and that makes the auto spring cleaning a joy rather than a chore and I think we could really apply this to everything that we doing and may I often find that if I'm free sample I actually won pay attention to the thing that I'm eating because I'll be listening to an audiobook or watching TV or just thinking about something completely random and then before I know what the meals over-running like well I did really taste any button so now whenever I'm doing something and I find my mom I try and remind myself that don't do what you doing keep your attention focused and being present in this moment where you're actually doing the thing or other than multitasking and thinking about dozen different things while washing dishes or doing are Nick for example next we have the idea of improvised productivity on an episode of my first million podcast where they were discussing interviewing and invest what is improvisational productivity the less noble it becomes to do writing things on your to-do list and then coming back to them later helps you focus but it comes at a cost you've now converted an interesting idea into work since you've thought about it a little bit it's less interesting to work on an object Wella products that I've been working on some time last year I started a second YouTube channel called appendix which was going to hell is lots of medical education related things and I've been toying with the idea for a whole year and I've been making all these plans but yeah after getting excited making all the plans I then didn't bother working on it because I'd already done the fun bit of thinking about it and turning and that was that was kind of cool and then executing on it just felt like work and so I didn't do it equally anytime I make a new skill check last the longest and the longer we spend planning it the less likely it is to get done because now the fun stuff is done and it's only the work that's remaining until what I tried to do now is when I have an idea for something I will do what I can to try on it straight away and I think there's a real you in minimizing the time between thinking of something and then executing on it like obviously planning is useful to an extent but as Daniel says that we actually become less productive when we spend a lot of time planning just seems a lot less interesting to us next we have an idea called homework for life and I came across this in a book called story worthy by chop called Matthew dicks and this guy is like an expert Storyteller and is really good at telling stories and storytelling is something that I improve about myself over this book in an attempt to hopefully improve my own storytelling and to make my Youtube videos a little bit Besa and the idea behind homework for life is that it's an exercise that we do every single night before we go to bed and it's all homework for life so we do it for the rest of us Andy exercise is simple we just want to ask yourself the question of what is the most storyworthy moment of my day like if I had to tell a story about something that happened today what would I tell a story about an idea is that we make spreadsheet or I do this an ocean of essay where we write it right on the dates and then write down a story where the moment that is has a few different benefits mostly it just helps us remember more of life like I did this for Life thing for is a few months and then I completely forgot about it and now when I when I look back at my list I can quite vividly remember each day where I've written a story where the entry I do that was the day without thing happened at work with that was the day with this person came over for dinner if I imagine the rest of the time in a few months where I wasn't doing this religiously every night those days it's little blended into each other and especially with the whole lockdown thing especially with exit of everyday feeling very similar to The Lost I found that I remember a lot less of the things in my life and therefore in a wait time has been moving faster for me whereas when I do my homework for Life Time move slower because my perception of time slows down because now I'm remembering more things about my date so that's one benefit from better but the second benefit is that when it comes to storytelling will and I'm definitely guilty of this will feel that our lives are boring and we have nothing to tell a no I haven't been on holiday anyway I think today or I haven't done anything particularly wild but very nice things that Matthew says in the book he says that no one wants to hear your drinking stories and no one wants to hear about your travel stories those are two categories of stories that just like throw away completely that made me feel pretty good cuz I'm like I don't have many travel story And yet when I think of how the story. Those two are the first things I come to that whatever I hear people tell the story it's always either about drinking or about traveling so if we do this homework for Life thing we and we have to pick out a story Woody moment of all day if we had to we could it forces us to think of Our Lives as being more interesting than they actually are but also to find the actual story moments with an alive because most Story Woody moments actually come from failure and transformation rather than oh my God that you wouldn't believe all the different places we've been sick so I am trying to get myself to do I have an iPad Air on my bedside table where I write down my homework for life in motion every evening sometimes I remember to do this sometimes I forget I'm trying to build more into my routine where I can systemize this thing so that I will always remember to do homework the life every single day next is something that I only discovered earlier this year and that is the incredible power of listening to audiobooks at like speed multiple select 2X or 1.5 xr2 XP David listen to audiobooks on Audible seems like 2017y first discovered the mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson and at the time I try to listen at 2x speed and then iced iced I kept listening to these look really long fantasy audiobook series for example this year I finished the Wheel of Time series which is 14 bucks and I've been listening to it since March of 2019 to tell me a whole like 12 months plus to finish the wheel but this year I realize that actually especially for the slower bits of these books if I to speed up to 1.5 Raven 2x speed even sometimes higher than that I personally don't lose any extra enjoyment from it going fast in fact I gained more enjoyment because it's Foster and therefore there's like more exciting stuff happening so now you know at the moment I'm listening to rhythm of War just came out like 2 weeks ago and 1.5 x speed because I want to fitbit's I'll slow down to One X speed but it's just something that I haven't really appreciate it before this year and thanks to you listening to stop at 2x speed 03 Speedo or whatever I'm not going through a lot more books and this is useful because I was like do useful because it reduces the time cost for any book that someone recommends to me like a few months ago I remember someone recommended Tigers orthography the ride of a lifetime he was the CEO of the Walt Disney Company for 15 years and I saw it wasn't when I saw it was like an 8 Hour audiobook and so if I if I listened at 2x speed it would become a four hour audiobook and so over the course of 2 days driving to and from what I listen to the holy book in Just 4 hours and it was a really good book and I wouldn't I would not have read it how do I know how that's be multiple cuz it would have just felt like too much of it do anybody have 8 hours listen to this and I can process in an unjaded Jade video I think in December of 2019 and I did the exercise run about this time last year not the Odyssey Fun is an exercise that apparently they get Stanford Business School students to go through and it's in three parts the first part is in detail what your life will look like 5 years from now if you go down your current Puffs you write that letter details like what was that look like if you continue doing what you doing number 2 what does life look like in 5 years time if you take it completely different what does life look like 5 years from now if you take a path where money and societal obligations are not affected they have to consider answer when I did the Odyssey sign in this time last year they made me realize that the part that I was which was doing medical training in the UK and living in Cambridge all my life and maybe becoming a supervisor at a college and doing medical education that I was kind of on and I slept realized actually this is maybe not where I actually want to be 5 years from now because it felt easy it felt like a cad does no real challenge long hair I know that I can make this happen and it just kind of lost all the excitement to me and when I thought about all the other things I could be doing this Odyssey plan exercise with was party what prompted me to you're out of medicine to directly travel the world before the world ended and now I'm going to take a foot a year out of full-time medical training so that I can travel more hopefully when the coronavirus situation gets less bad glitter things that in five years from now I would have much that I spent two years maybe James YouTube thing probably the weather like in Australia for a bit doing stuff like that rather than you know five years from now I'm doing I'm going to work everyday I'm doing the same thing I've always done and I'm just climbing up the essentially that corporate ladder while staying in my comfort zone so exercise I will be forever grateful to Jade for showing me this in a video where she talks about how to figure out what to do with your life but it's something I think about a lot what is my life going to look like in 5 years and is this something that I want to change this year I really appreciated the power of clarity. I'm sorry seems like is one of the five steps of David Allen's approach called getting things done which is like the Bible about productivity and the five steps of that capture clarify organize reflects and engage the kerafiber is very important thing because when it comes to for example a to-do list a big part of why we procrastinate from doing things is because the thing we have to do is just not clear enough if I were to write life lessons video it's a very negative thing or right to the script for the 20. Doesn't that's more specific actually is chemistry it's never going to get done because like what the hell does kung fu originate revised chapter 1 module 4 within physiology about Horton membranes and stuff then that's a more specific thing it feels like less of a mental when it comes to actually doing the thing so now whenever I go through my to-do-list I always think I K how it like do I have a really clarified every single item on here and is it really obvious what I actually have to do this and I've seen this happen with basically all of my friends who struggle with procrastination is that okay what are you supposed to be doing I would like some prep for my exam okay are the items on your to-do list less likely you are to procrastinate at least that's what I found I found it really helpful to move away from thinking of time in 1 hour chunks instead to think of time in 15 minute chunks so just like by default in my head time in 1 hour episode 1 serving from it and see if it's like 10:37 or something that I think oh well you know what a reasonable time I'm just going to stop and then I will procrastinate start work at 11 or if I'm arranging a phone call with someone I do just by default the white calendars upright like Google Calendar and just going to default doesn't for an hour until I have phone call from my friend from like 12 to 1 and if it finishes at like 12 oh okay well finish that one and then the next thing at 1:58 minutes to wait 1045 and I can do the thing I actually want to do at 10:45 rather than procrastinating an extra 15 minutes and waiting to do it at 11 and so now when I'm scheduling meetings and stuff I do try and think of it in terms of 15 minute increments rather than in 1 hour increments giving me a lot more time in my life this year next let's talk about the idea of goals before this year I used to be very Auntie goal-setting because I used to think that okay what's the point of setting a goal like the only point of setting a goal is like a field what does like if I have AAA I want to hit 2 million subscribers by the end of the year or whatever that feels like a very pointless goal because if I hit it then you know I'll get a nice feeling for 2 seconds and then the goalposts will shift and if I don't hit it and I'll be disappointed because I didn't hit my goal the reason that I was antigos is because I felt that the thing that we should be trying to cultivate is self-acceptance and alive at least me and that you know it's if it feels like a more worthwhile a.m. to try to be satisfied with what I have Roth event can you please try for more this year that I've been doing we're having a conversation I've asked almost everyone about how they think about goals and one thing I've learned is that it's actually completely okay have this tension between self-acceptance and self-improvement and it's like yes on the one hand we can learn to accept yourself for who we are but on the other hand we can also strive to improve who we are and do more interesting things and I strive to do challenging happy stretch goals Duff and I used to try and find like a hoe this going to be a way to reconcile these two things that's going to be way to reconcile self-acceptance versus self-improvement but then I don't know who it was I feel like it was maybe howdy who identity black with it said that you know you actually don't need to reconcile that you can accept that yes part of me is focusing on self-acceptance but another part of me is focusing on self-improvement that is how I think about goals my own personal like personal fulfillment be reliant on that goal being fulfilled at this point we're going to be 15 life lessons the other five lessons are actually in the extended version of this video what you'll find on nebula if you haven't heard training platform that's run by me and a bunch of other creators and on nebula WE Post extended versions of YouTube videos ad-free versions of YouTube videos and load of other exclusive content that you won't find on YouTube it's not supposed to be a competitive YouTube because you can is it supposed to be like an extra place we can put stuff without having to worry about the YouTube algorithm until nebula I've got lots of other exclusive things so for example I've got my work the series which does a deep dive into my productivity Workforce but using different apps I have my deep dive snippet series take Scuttlebutts I Snippets from Aldi interview that I do with people across the internet and turns them into bite-sized chunks that you can consume there also add free versions of all my videos with extended versions of videos like this one has five more life so if you go to subscription to Navy.

            "text": " 8 tips that I find helpful for reading more consistently these days I'm averaging about one or two books every week, this is alongside my full-time job being a doctor and my part-time career of being a YouTuber and running a business like Alyssa the point is that I find the time to read in my routine and I think over the loss of eight years of reading a lot that has so much value to my life as usual * * all of these are going to be in the video description and append comments you can skip around the video if you feel like it but let's get it. phone number one is that you should get a Kindle like there is some evidence I link it down below if I can find it that says that people in America who use e-readers read about 44 to 50% more books per year than people who don't use he read his amazing I've been reading absolutely candle scents like 2008 so very long time experience three other videos where talk about how amazing it is having a Kindle so if you don't come in so far then please have a look at those videos when it comes to reading and everyone that I have how much is recommendation down the throat of Hezbollah Kendall has said to me later on the I'm going to go out to go to Kendall because now I read so much more and it's just continue with it so yeah kind of like a mindset shift and I found that when I develop this mindset it could have changed the game for me much like Anita Kendall. It's okay not to finish a book previously I had this view is like books being the sacred prestigious object that if I was going to reading a book I would have to finish it what's the next one even if I found it boring in there so many people have spoken to over the last few months when we can we like talk about reading and consistency and stuff cuz this is the last time I talked about for the last 18 months and just haven't haven't got around to finishing it and yeah everytime I sit down to read sapiens that I Tried reading it and I got bored off of off of page and I closed it and I go to say I just read something else eating books more like blog post if you were reading a blog post you wouldn't feel the sense of Shame if you didn't get to the end of it it's kind of like a book like yeah we should treat books much like we treat Optical the blog post on the internet in my life that mindset I find it easier to read more consistently a note to read Classics so this is a thing that I used to have back in the day they just go where I used to think if I'm reading I should read something good rather than just re-read Harry Potter I don't really care for enjoyment and I want to rate for enough to help my life get SSI and so the advice off and give to people is that when you're when you're a beginner and reading are you don't read very consistently this thing to start with is not something like Charles Dickens even though it's a good book or like Gennaro's like these Classics that people say a good butt. You know or from a bygone era Avenues of these fancy as English literature sold books like Charles Dickens and Shakespeare and all that stuff recently read the changeling series which is a series of 16 books on the Paranormal romance genre fun the cool the different characters double magical powers a fold in Louisville that so Jazz I'm not thinking about you. I'm not feeling guilty when I'm reading it when everything just thinking thinking that I'm reading trash and I think because I've got this attitude of I don't care as long as read much more consistently because it means that there isn't any of this baggage associated with having to struggle through reading classes phone number for that and that is that it's okay to skim through Book Sales the guy was talking about there being two modes of reading level 1 where you reading for enjoyment and number to wear your reading for information or inspiration or if that's what his stuff and reading for enjoyment like reading fiction so if I'm reading for enjoyment then I went really care about in a highlighting passages he knows what I got there cuz I'm reading for enjoyment I'm also okay with skipping bits of lung better description like if I get the idea if I'm really wrapped up in the story I don't feel the need to read absolutely every word and then when I'm reading nonfiction I'm not really reading it for enjoyment older some of them are quite good but I'm moving it for National educational inspiration stuff like that and so my tactics were reading that is about different like a skin stuff as well be I'll be looking for things to highlight on Kindle Kindle highlighting thing is amazing see I sometimes not even stop by looking at the table of contents scroll through and see which bits of the book catch my eye drawing attention to flick a few pages eyeball some of the words on subsequent Pages see if it's going to get more interesting and if not I'll just close the book and read something else like I'm treating these books exactly like I'm freaking out the blog post I'm not feeling guilty for skimming over not finishing on it is that I find it very helpful to build reading into my daily routine so my night time routine consists of me brushing my teeth change door Barenaked depending on how I'm feeling to take a day getting into bed heading Alexa to turn the lights to relax which is like a nice like Alexa turn on relax in the living room turn on ice and fire in the living room that we got back across the room I set the alarm for 6 in the morning which means the only thing I can do when I'm in bed I need to sleep or read on my Kindle through doing that for the last like 5 6 years I just going to read every single night before bed and I read until I feel tired I feel my eyes begin to close and then I'm like great I'm falling asleep I'm going to close the candle put on the bedside table and I will fall asleep that is just the way I was built reading into my night time routine and so it's pretty easy for me to finish you know one book a week because I'm reading for at least 20 minutes half an hour each day and if it's particularly you know gripping book happen to like to 3 in the morning and I'll be super glad that I did and recently I've read lots of books about blood shoe dog and third or in particular that have kept me up way into the night because they just enjoyed it so much even when you I'm here I'm going to get a plug to a foldable foldable is amazing it's like the best audiobook couple never video I just didn't know that one video a few weeks ago and I've been using them for the last like 2 years on it's just more like one of the best 799 a month anything. Because when I'm in the car when I'm at the gym I can be listening to audiobooks at 10 tomorrow to listen to fiction rather than nonfiction reading nonfiction it's better to read on Kindle because then you can highlight stuff you can skim a little easier what's fiction you know wait till you see very good at the moment I'm listening to that The Wheel of Time series by I don't even know who it's by but SS you like a 30 day free trial on a free audiobook on a two free audible Originals something like that you should have a look yes that is correct your choice along with two free audible original so you really might as well give it a shot of my opinion it's the best 799 a month I spend until 7 is that I think is really helpful to have an account on Goodreads which is also coincidentally owned by Amazon who are not puncturing the video unfortunately has really good because it's like the ultimate social network for books kind of they've got Library every single book ever published if we're going to make you reading a book on Kindle you old it automatically can add it to your currently reading section of goods were gone Goodreads and then when you finish the book I lost you to get a writing and that was mostly goes to Goodreads account and to overtime you develop this Library truck every book you ever read and if you want you can write a book review you can read other people's book reviews you can follow recommendations other people have until when I first go to Goodreads account I think it was like for 5 years ago now I spent a day just racking my brain and thinking about to every book I've ever read I'm just adding it to my Goodreads through I've read this book library and giving a writing if I could remember what the book was about and now I've got like three hundred and something books in this in this Library just like a puzzle game we play with ourselves but I found that is another thing that's helped me read a lot more consistently as you guys are interested I link my own Goodreads profile in the video description you can follow my profile you can add me as a friend and you can see all the books I read no. Maybe that might help you get some book recommendations if you're into that sort of thing and funny Point number eight is a service call to read wise that's absolutely incredible because what they do is that they sync to your Amazon account and if like me you read everything on Kendall and if you have a little highlights what it does is that it send you an e-mail every day with five random highlights from running books that you read until I found this to be an absolutely amazing way to resurface content that I had read in the past and I thought was legit enough highlighted but before discovering realize I didn't really have a way of actively going through my highlights like the case in the eyebrows the Kindle app and go through my highlights for a particular book if I was researching a blog post or an email newsletter that quotes from Happy butter and brown that put from two of the Titans by Tim Ferriss actually applies to the thing I'm thinking about at the moment but that's a fantastic way of resurfacing the stuff that you highlighted in reminding yourself of these life lessons. You know if you feel like me and you read everything on Kindle smnc valuable that you can sync all your highlights to Evernote so I started doing that recently and so if I'm making a video about productivity I can just control as productivity on Evernote and that will include with in that surgery would find me any quotes about product I've highlighted in various books I think at the moment I have like two thousand highlights across hundreds of books on Kindle in there for the roasting so just going to be Ultimate Way of building a second brain why buy anything that you think is good enough to be highlighted is then sociable whenever you want to find something and that is another thing that's helped me read more consistently because now I feel excited to highlight stuff and whenever I come across a new password this goes against Real Madrid white library is going to go into evernote and I'll be able to have this as a piece of a piece of wisdom that I can call upon whenever I need it on how to read more consistently main thing that candle and build it into your night time routine as a finish a book it's okay to skim and it's okay to not read the classics you can just kind of read whatever you want this reading is supposed to be fun to be the store this thing of the only had to do nothing besides in soap were there somewhere that would be a playlist of some of my recommended reading so I'll go video called free books that changed my life and another video about 3 recommended fantasy books to listen to on Audible so you can check those out"

Holding us back from doing creative or entrepreneurial things will things that require any level of risk-taking or putting ourselves out there and whenever we try and do any of the stuff we always go up against this hill of procrastination at the constant battle in the nice quote from the book for he says we don't tell ourselves I'm never going to write my Symphony instead we say I am going to write my Symphony I'm just going to start tomorrow I've heard this a million times people be like I'm going to start a podcast but you know the time he's not quite right all you know I haven't quite with a gear I haven't quite procrastination is building within us but we're ready fuels resistance is fear resistance is activated by fear and gangster whatever we give into that fear creating a cycle that we fall into and what leads to resistance becoming even stronger as a fear becomes even write it but he says in the book fear is actually a very good thing because when we feel scared about doing something it usually means we should just do the thing he writes number one rule of thumb the most scared we are off of work or calling the more show we can be that we have to do an airway resistance is that compass that points to was the thing in a life of actually most important for us to do like I never feel any resistance what sitting down and playing World of Warcraft do you spell resistance to what sitting down and writing my book and that tells me that sitting down to write my book is currently the most important thing I need to be working on it from here to experience the more important article project in 2017 I actually started using this as a model for it away model for decision-making like if I feel scared about doing something then more often than not I will try my very best to actually do the thing at so far in my life I have never regretted doing but I've always regretted melting something that I was scared of so now that we've done step one which is no or any man weave Define persistence and figured out what actually is it's that source that makes it procrastinate we need to figure out some ways of dealing with it we just become a professional in the book price is the idea of the professional versus the amateur amateur takes action whenever inspiration strikes or when they're in the right mood and not committed in the goals of focused on fun money and Status a professional I like sad that the work is a priority that determined and committed to succeed by following the inner drive and creative spirit that the only way we can deal with resistance is if we become a professional without work rather than an amateur I think I think it's interesting how Define professionals being someone who makes money from the thing cuz you can want to make money from a thing but still treat it like a complete amateur but instead a professional is someone who does it for the sake of doing the work and takes pride in the work itself and there's a few of the traits that professionals have when it comes to doing that job professional then you will show up everyday to your job no matter what you want to just not go to work because you don't feel like it if you're a professional you work through adversity and you open to criticism because you always want to improve whereas if you're an amateur then you feel like you know if you draw something will make a video and someone give you buckwheat about, you get like really kind of woe is me and like it hurts your feelings at like ruin your life because you're freaking like an amateur whereas if you feed as a professional you would be more inclined to actually grow from the feedback a professional as well understand that fear is just like if you're a doctor and that's your profession you know that you're going to be stepping outside your comfort zone if you approach things with a mature perspective like starting as soon as the going gets tough then you're going to fold like a cheap suit as they say and finally if you're a professional with you you recognize that facing the resistance is the daily battle what I'm looking at the doctor when I wake up in the morning then I think I already feel like I do I do it anyways Paul the day to buy flights that's what you have to do when your dog trained you know someone asks you to put an IV or cannula into a patient who you know has difficult veins I want to do this but it's part of the work is part of the job this is what I have to do and we want to be kind of taking that sort of attitude towards our other like creative an entrepreneurial stuff and oversee there is some level in which you can take this too far like being so focused on using your hobbies as a professional to the point where you're doing it for 8 hours a day is probably a little bit excessive and there is something something to be said for not monetizing all of your hobbies or at least not trying to make a living from your hobbies because I hope he has fun when it makes a bit of money like playing if I could get paid a bit of money to play the guitar that would make it very very fun but if I was relying on playing the guitar for earning a living as a professional I like it just means that we're approaching it with a bit more of a professional mindset rather than the mindset of oh I'll do my thing whenever I feel like it but doesn't really work if you're treating something like a pro keep what number three is we need to banish the ego he said that once we become a professional I need to do is recognize the ongoing battle between the South and the ego and the way I see this is that our ego is more focused on external events and how other people see us we're at the self is this intercom that we have which is about the way that we see ourselves when we last by origo I mean to maintain the status of the eye in the world and what does focused on how external events affect us and everything is very superficial and surface-level then we go to self which is made up of the individual and Collective unconscious errors of a Minds which includes our dreams intuition and aspirations are compasses the deepest form of who we are and when we sit down to create we're attempting to channel to self because it's through the self that we can beat resistance some of this stuff is a little bit woo for my liking like pressfield goes on about like how creative Endeavors alike plane of existence and role striving for that plane of existence and resistance is like the devil that gets in the way it kind of like the growth mindset and fixed mindset stuff in a way when we have a fixed mindset and we get like negative feedback or something it would do something it really shakes us to the car because it like damages are we go when we have a growth mindset to something we recognize that if we fail at something is just part of the process of improving every time I think of this is when it comes to goal setting I get a lot more resistance by procrastination when I've got goals that are based on outcomes that are outside of my control so free sample if I'm making YouTube videos which is an easy example one way of thinking about my goals for you to think about this video to get this many views or I want to hit this many subscribers by the end of the year that's a very outcome go at night outside of my control anything in my control is making videos but if I have a goal that I want this video to be really good then that's when the perfectionism takes hold that's what I feel. that's when I procrastinate so much to the point I don't even make the video and I seen this basically with every student has been through my pots on YouTuber Academy anyone who's doing YouTube. YouTube. YouTube taking it seriously a few start thinking that this video needs to be good as defined by what but think of it it makes it really hard to actually make the video where is why I prefer is to have most of my goals being input golzari bear entirely within my control their entirety based on inputs by control so I'm going to make two videos a week for the rest of my life within my control I'm going to write the best book that I can order it and a book that I'm happy with is an input goal it's a goal within my control whereas I'm going to write a book and I wanted to hit the New York Times bestseller list I find that when it comes again to the writing my book anytime I even think of that outcome goal I feel the procrastination I feel the resistance I feel the pain whereas when I think you know what my job is to just write the best books I can it becomes a lot easier to do and now I realize that if I'm struggling with procrastination usually it's the resistance getting in the way and usually it's because I have some kind of outcome goal associated with the thing which for me personally is bad for some people but I don't personally like number one in Indiana me I either assistance number to become a professional and number three banished to Ego there's a lot more stuff about this in the book the whereabouts which as you can see it doesn't take very long to read only takes 2 hours to listen to evangelizing in fact it's one of the nicest feet in the world when one of my friends started signed up for audible account getting into audio books and tells me oh my God I sounded a little bit cuz of your recommendation and now I'm reading this phone Series in my mind is blank because it was so good so if you want to learn more about beating procrastination audiobook but if you looking for fiction recommendations which is what I personally prefer to listen to most of the time in Woodinville I would 1,000% recommend the mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson series is narrated by God called Michael Kramer who is like Envy best narrator in the world in my opinion full series of The Stormlight Archive of The Wheel of Time in these are like Amazing Fantasy Books that I've been listening to audible but since like 2017 and I basically had Michael, Michael Kramer's voice in my head at all times so if you knew the world v-bucks recommended mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson the first book I started listening to that in like yeah 2017 is completely change my life because now Brandon Sanderson is my favorite and I freaking love listening to fantasy books on Audible Another One Bites the Dust by Neil Gaiman best love story and it's just like no rated very well by Neil Gaiman himself Stardust by Neil Gaiman fiction or the warbot if you would like to talk again this video anyone learn more about how to beat the resistance honestly off the hundred plus after I subscribe to I always say even one of those descriptions that I would hold above all else I would even cancel my Netflix subscription on My World of Warcraft subscription if I have to in order to just described it will double as the only thing because the amount of value is added to My Life and Times of how little I pay for each month is just absolutely astronomical and the most cost-effective thing that I own in my life forever never forget this very moment we can change our lives and if it was a moment and never will be when we all without the power to alter our destiny this second we can turn the tables on Resistance not this book had a pretty profound effect on my life had am I crazy Florida impacted my life and check out this playlist over here is about 3 books that changed my life and we put a few other very short videos summarizing some of the other books that I loved and I really help me in life. Thank you so much for watching I will see you next time goodnight"

            "text": " I'll drink around four cups of coffee everyday and I've often wondered is this a good thing or bad thing I'm doing with my life so in this video the very first episode of taking a break from the Deluge of coronavirus right content and we'll be looking at the scientific behind weather drinking coffee is good for you at 7 to it what does coffee actually do well as you might know coffee contains caffeine and caffeine to the Natural stimulant which blocks one of the neurotransmitters in the brain called adenosine inhibitory neurotransmitter and so it's main action is to dampen down brain activity and so when caffeine blocks adenosine actually increases over only run on firing in the brain and that increases the activity of other neurotransmitters like dopamine which ultimately stimulate changes energy mood and attention he's got a few other bits in it other than just caffeine but because it's mostly caffeine that causes the positive and negative effects that we're going to be focusing on in this video and caffeine and therefore coffees most famous effect is that it in haunted or mental performance 10 ways Social Studies have shown that coffee improve cognitive function in terms of alertness and vigilance why they gave 20 healthy male volunteers different doses of caffeine and they showed that just 30 mg of caffeine less than half a cup of coffee that was enough to increase their or distributed Us by either one more aware of the auditory stimuli around them it was increase the visual reaction times re they were able to respond to stuff quicker secondly we put the paper from the European Food Safety Authority and they reviewed randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials on the effect of caffeine attention and they said that overall that was a cause and effect relationship between a 75 mg of caffeine and increased attention on They concluded that caffeine increases both selective attention and sustained attention so selective attention is kind of focusing on one thing at a time and sustained attention is kind of being able to focus for extended periods of time but it always seemed very useful when was studying reproductive 2013 and they looked at 66 double-blind placebo-controlled trials and they said that both simple and complex attention tossed will consist of the affected by caffeine consumption caffeine affect both reaction times and the accuracy on a variety of simple talk higher order processes involved in active monitoring and coordination of behavior twitching response inhibition and interference rule They concluded that caffeine has clear beneficial effect on attention and The Defector even more widespread than previously assumed does caffeine there for coffee improve alertness and I can attest to that whenever I have one cup of coffee I feel like I'm more alert and focused more on the evidence in literature set for example you got this story from 2009 where they gave load college students 6 list 15 word h to memorize an enzyme test I gave him caffeine beforehand and sibo and a ruler found that the students like caffeine will more able to recall the words and the students have been given the placebo study was quite interesting because the students got caffeine what was able to recall the wrong like wrong words like was that one on the left side not memorized but that could be so related to the words desk a fully conclusive 100% study but you also did conclude that caffeine appears to intensify the strength of connections amongst list words on critical I was there by enhancing both true and false memory consolidation of memories history from Johns Hopkins University in 2014 and the story was interesting because normally studies give people caffeine before they get us to learn words and then get tested on them for what they gave him caffeine or Placebo after they go after and it was pretty good study because they use a hundred sixty students it was double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized and they tested the performance of the group's the caffeine group and the placebo group 24 hours off of the roster for I was off Administration according to an inverted u-shaped dose response curve this effect was specifically consolidation and not retrieval we conclude that caffeine and Hans consolidation of long-term memories in humans but that it'll say that we conclude that a dose of at least two how many grams is required to observe the effect of caffeine on consolidation of memory which is about two regular cups of coffee so two cups of coffee a day John Hopkins University is improving the consolidation of memories what is suggested coffee can actually improve our mood on top of the other things it does for example this was a study from 2011 done by Harvard that use fifty thousand volunteers and it was a long story over 10 years. Which is really hard to do and initially at Baseline these the study didn't have any kind of severe symptoms of depression or clinical depression but the study looked at with a correlation was between that coffee consumption and the subsequent risk of developing depression and they said that the risk of depression decreased in a dose-dependent mother with increasing consumption of calf coffee and that basically let them to conclude that the more coffee drink the less lucky you are to be depressed the actual causation aspect that is probably 346913 different people and they showed that 300 milligrams of caffeine which is about three or four cups of coffee that could be helpful for those suffering with depression with a protective effect of coffee and partially of tea and caffeine on the risk of depression acquitted from the study and for me personally but I've noticed that when I'm drinking caffeine. Really gives me a mental boost and help me get out of the stump. I'm in at the moment and I find out that mental abuse is similar to what I get when I do online courses on brilliant fantastic online platform for boosting a cognitive abilities and they put crosses on math science and computer science and Israel's birthday really interesting but they're also challenging enough in a way that really makes your brain work when you go through them like it's not just been feeding information it's ready concept and I'm giving you a problem that helps you run with the concept to try and solve it for yourself the quote that I'm working through these days is called introduction to neural networks and is atopic driving curious about for a few years especially in medicine we've got all this talk about neural network AI getting all this stuff being used to interpret Medical Imaging like x-ray CT scans and ECGs and so this cool some breathing is really giving me a a a good starting point to how this whole neural network thing works and the nice thing about it is that it doesn't like drill down into beanie but they use these clever it's kind of problems that you have to solve for yourself to help you understand like the potentially complicated math behind which everyday give you one or two different problems to solve and these contain 5 minutes and 15 minutes depending on how much effort you want to put in and actually do find that sometimes I do like study with me videos I will drink my cup of coffee and then if I'm still feeling this lump I will do an online course or like a day challenge that mental really gets me to the Moose. so if you happen to be stuck at home for whatever reason we just want to improve your cognitive abilities and the first 200 people to visit annual premium subscription vigilance memory recall and even mood that's all talk about the effects of coffee on physical form and the way this works is that coffee contains caffeine and caffeine is an adenosine antagonist block the actions of inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine overrule closing firing in the brain but when does monurol firing in the brain the brain think so crappy night we must be doing something serious and it increases the amount of adrenaline and I bought it so that we produce more adrenaline increase the heart rate and makes us pumped and more like exercising we've got some evidence that caffeine consumption can increase the amount of time you can do exercise until you become exhausted so if we're going we put the study from 1978 they got nine Competitive Cyclist to basically as much as I could until the exhausted and couldn't cycle anymore and in one of the test they gave them coffee with caffeine beforehand and the other one that gave them decaffeinated coffee and they found that Indie caffeine group The caffeinated coffee group they were able to exercise for 90.2 minutes before collapsing ocean but the decaffeinated coffee group could only exercise 475.5 minutes before they collapsed of exhaustion and sewed the fact that they drank coffee that contains caffeine vs. coffee the didn't contain caffeine that increase their performance Time by roundabout 20% Which is pretty good going research that suggests that coffee can reduce our perception of tiredness during exercise so for example in 2015 that European Food Safety Authority published their official scientific opinion on the safety of caffeine and that was a meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trial caffeine and sports performance and they concluded that a cause-and-effect relationship has been established between the consumption of caffeine and an increase in endurance capacity from the University of Illinois which showed that caffeine consumption can reduce Dome so delayed onset muscle soreness which is that kind of bumpy car painting that you got your muscles a day or two after exercising and what they did is that they go 18 men stood them up into two groups when was the placebo group of the gym and then they assess house so the muscles were like a day-to-day 3 days 5 days after doing the bicycles and they found the group that had caffeine before sore muscles two and a three which is when Dome security kicks in those who have caffeine had less sore muscles than those who didn't have caffeine caffeine when did they find out that way they did as many reps of bicep curls they couldn't they managed to get more reps in the group overall they said that decrease the perception of soreness in the days after a strenuous resistance training workout may allow individuals to increase the number of training sessions in a given time. So yeah over old that suggests unload all the studies back this up that caffeine might help our recovery from an interesting made between 1984 and 2004 the world anti-doping Authority said that caffeine had such an effect on physical performance they banned High quantities of caffeine from Olympic events but then in 2004 for some reason they said that caffeine meet the criteria that they had set out for being an unfit father not answer. Everyone probably has coffee before because they know the caffeine is improved physical performance Performance Physical performance but actually I'm quite a link between caffeine consumption and a reduction in long-term health problems some key micronutrients like vitamin B2 B3 and B5 with naturally found in coffee beans and coffee contains natural antioxidants as well I would quit this one still hear from the Journal of nutrition that showed that coffee was the single biggest source of antioxidant intake in the body when compared with a lot of other stuff including fruits vegetables and cereal so yeah but also secondly and I think more interesting any coffee consumption is negatively correlated with a bunch of long-term health problems to firstly coffee consumption is inversely correlated with the development of some neurodegenerative conditions 6:30 that was done in 2010 and they found that 300 milligrams of coffee per day which is 3/4 cups of coffee that reduced the risk of developing Parkinson's Disease by 32% but even so the officer said that this study confirmed an inverse association between caffeine intake and the risk of Parkinson's disease which can hardly be explained by bias or uncontrolled confounding and in relation to Alzheimer's disease we put this study from 2010 that looked at 1004 the nine individuals aged between 65 and 79 and that examined them over a 21 year. Which is really long. Of time and they showed that coffee consumption in the midlife reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia in the elderly with the lowest risk because they 65%. find the groups that had between 3 and 5 cups of coffee a day between puffy intake and type 2 diabetes 1 million people in total analyzed and they should have statistically inverse correlation between coffee consumption and the development of type 2 diabetes diabetes decreased by 6% each cup per day increase in coffee consumption and those consuming 5 cups of coffee per day suggested that those five or more cups of coffee per day could be a correlation early could reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 29% this review in 2017 that says in healthy people in comparison to not consuming coffee habitual consumption of 325 cups of coffee per day is associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease and coffee consumption has not been linked to elevated these risk for the things that the more coffee you drink lower your risk of cardiovascular diseases but they've not shown any link between drinking too much coffee and getting more chiropractor today so yeah that seems pretty legit for now stroke this meta-analysis from 2011 and they looked at 11 prospective studies that over 10,000 cases of stroke and over 450,000 participants across the studies and they show the coronation that drinking two cups of coffee per day reduce the risk of Stroke by send an drinking three cups of coffee today reduce your risk of Stroke by 17% again Purity correlational but still the data does solar add up to the fact that coffee is calligraphy is your risk of certain types of cancer in 2016 for example the international Agency for research on cancer a thing they published review over a thousand studies looking at the links between coffee and cancer and Thursday they found that there was no direct correlation between drinking coffee and you developing cancer but in fact they found an inverse relationship between drinking coffee and developing certain types of cancer so for example that was some evidence that coffee is linked to reduced risk of liver cancer they said that this response analysis revealed a significant linear play some chips between coffee consumption and liver cancer risk subgroup analysis answer this review of 1000 studies that says that there's no link between drinking coffee and colon cancer but in fact there is a negative correlation are the more coffee you drink the less lucky you are to develop liver cancer again with the caveat the oldest Basin electric Whitehall detectives in Apalachin fashion but still there's a lot of days out there that supports the fact that coffee seems to be on the 7th can increase alertness vigilance we got some evidence that too much coffee can cause anxiety restlessness and agitation for this review from 2010 that completed low doses caffeine improves hedonic tone and reduces anxiety intense arousal including anxiety nervousness and jitteriness so yeah as we all know if you drink too much coffee you get caught at 3 with consent to be bad but increasingly the author of the study also said that caffeine is also been reported to prevent cognitive decline in health about the coffee can reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's and Dementia and stuff if you look at the correlation study says that the results of the study the heterogeneous some funding no age-related effect While others reported affect only in one sex the oldest population so what you're saying is that we really shouldn't take this whole caffeine reduces your risk of dementia we shouldn't take that at face value because there was a lot of variation between studies and it kind of depends on how old when we have caffeine special late for the day that can be negatively impact asleep so for example we got this story from 2013 and they gave different people a400m dose of caffeine so about 4 and a bit cups of coffee either 03 or six hours before bed compared to a placebo group who had a placebo pill and they showed that this moderate dose of caffeine whether you had it just before or 3 hours before or even six hours before bedtime. Had a significant negative impact on quality of sleep what's 9 hours and so like people generally suggest and I'll start feeling this advice that you shouldn't drink any coffee off to 2 p.m. because. Like if you sleep at 9:10 and 11 p.m. that could still have a negative impact on your quality of sleep so overall is coffee good for you and suggest that actually coffee does reliably improve alertness vigilance memory recall and even mood provided you don't have too much of it because having too much of it can then cause anxiety and restlessness I'm a pretty good evidence that coffee is associate with increased physical exercise output and also reduce muscle soreness and also reduced perceived fatigue during exercise oldest correlational data that shows that coffee consumption tends to be linked to a decrease in things like the men Parkinson's Alzheimer's disease cardiovascular disease Strokes diabetes and a few other bits and bobs what we look at the scientific evidence Behind These interesting questions to see if you have any questions you'd like to come up please do take a comment down below and I will hopefully see you say goodbye"

            "text": " hello everyone welcome back to the peanut tip series my name is Ali I'm a v a medical student and today we're going to be chatting about chemistry calculations this is sort of a follow-up to the last video about your protection to chemistry so if you haven't seen that yet I suggest you do because that talks about the fundamentals questions are quite tricky tricky because the heart it is just Jesus he's an adult parole and if we have enough time we will be able to get a hundred percent because of the timing he had to work out what the question is asking remember is mental math in under 1 minute questions there are three things we need to do first thing we need to know the formula for everything thinking what was it mole under way around this is to just memorize that triangle formula thing and just hope that I can plug numbers into it that works perfectly fine when you don't want to be wasting all that time thinking about it for me. which way around the MRI at the end of whatever it was and then having to plug numbers into it really want to understand it any more conceptual intuitively let's calling Ron would use the formula triangle in King riots or his number intuitively that there for 36 grams of carbon is going to be three moles that he could very well fuse by In the Heat of the exam where is her money is thinking about it more intuitively she understands the concept of a mole and therefore doesn't need to remember formula in order to convert grams to moles she just kind of does it without thinking the money we'll save precious second Beach time she does want to be a calculation which of the two paper out of two quite a bit of time would you want me spending getting another question right if this is confusing the link in the description to the free tutorial and Beyond intro that explains the concept mold in a way that we wished we had explained to us when we were doing the subject at a hole mystery calculations tutorial series is completely free on demand ninja calculations are probably the hardest part of being a chemistry and older the official guide does have some guards on them students are the pallet found our destination to be quite helpful in addition to the explanations of the guides you might want to check those out why were we talking about the three things that you need to do to improve your performance in the chemistry calculation questions we talked about knowing the formula inside out and then we talked about how you shouldn't overly rely on the formula for motor calculations the thing we need to get good at chemistry mental nuts and I'm going to be cooking a whole lot more about that in the approach to section 2 months video which is coming up for now a few things that are relevant to chemistry the beam at chemistry questions that involve numbers are weird at first glance the numbers can look really scary and students think that you need a calculator estimate to get the answer of 137 and then ask us to do something. why is converting 2.74 grams into moles at first contest in squats get it exactly half of 274 therefore we can use a bit of trickery we can think that if we had 274 grow Within 137 that would be to most but because we have 2.74 that's a 0.02 moles or two over a hundred 150 if you like thinking about things than fractions like we recommend you should you'll notice how we didn't use any formula in that we just knew that too who's going to be to mold for over a hundred thirty-seven written download feel very scared indeed so I'd want to avoid thinking like that sometimes we do have to. simple as 12 grams of carbon for 16 grams of oxygen the moral of the story is that in bement chemistry calculation questions you're going to be getting numbers that you don't really have to estimate heavily with building numbers that go into each other in some simple way or another if you are having the estimator for particular question you might want to double-check just to make sure you got the numbers right but if it's still taking too long they just ignore the question yes or no answer and move on it's not worth your time so yeah that concludes today's video on the beam as I said they're available completely free of charge and I put a link in the description below so what if we covered today well we talked about the three things that we need to do to improve our performance on the chemistry calculation questions remember then secondly we should try not to be overly reliant on the formula triangle from mole conversion and finally we should try and brush up on a mental math skills remembering that in vmat chemistry the numbers that usually quite nice which means we don't have the estimate too much and we shouldn't get frightened by numbers scary and thank you very much for watching if you like the video please get the thumbs-up button if you'd like to see a bit more please hit the Subscribe button and if you are taking the Beemer lovely day and I'll

            "text": " my friends welcome back to the channel this is going to be a little bit of a rumbly video where I explain the thought process behind why I left medicine and quit being a doctor about 6 months ago and why my mind is now changed and I'm now moving back into the medical if that sounds like it might be up to a straight and then grab a cup of tea and we can we can talk about it if not that's totally cool lots of other mobile videos on this channel at Elsewhere on the internet and off the internet so feel free to skip this one if you like so that start with a little bit of context you have a life and you haven't been following my kind of Life trajectory very very carefully basically from 2012 to 2018 I was a medical student at Cambridge University 2017 I started this YouTube channel in my finally 50th final year medical school for two years after that 2018 through to August 2020 I was working as a foundation year doctor in the East Anglia region of the UK that when we work as a junior doctors as Foundation don't have a specialty of that point we are rotating amongst lots of different Specialties to try and figure out what specific thing in medicine we'd like to do in America the closest thing would be an intern and the idea is off to these two years we've been make a decision as to what specialty or resin residency but that's what the American system is what specialty we want to go into at that point we can decide we want to go for internal medicine or do we want to go for surgery or do we want to go for some run through Specialties like Psychiatry and Obstetrics & Gynecology in like Neurosurgery big decision because this decision about which specialty want to go into pretty dictates a huge chunk of your life it like to take 3 spend your time with what you do maybe even who you marry maybe to give me who your friends are like it's like a ridiculously important decision and so in the UK hip doctors do is that off to the first two years of the foundation programme we will take a break and a little people take a year out sometimes two sometimes three to explore all the interest so let's say I thought I wanted to go into surgery but I thought pretty sure I want some more 4 year I could spend it doing extra shifts in a local hospital or going to Australia and doing some surgery stuff or maybe doing a research project and surgery and then at the end of my air I'll be able to decide you know what is surgery for me I'm not going to officially apply to a surgery training program this Gap this would have two year mark came at August 2020 where I have to decide okay do I want to go straight into a training program or do I want to take a break from medicine and do something else stuck in August 2019 I had to decide a year from now do I think I want to go directly into specialty training or instead do I want to take a break from medicine and do something else and in August 2019 when I made the decision to my plan was I definitely wanted to sometime out of medicine and I like the idea of traveling to different countries around the world I like the idea of maybe going to Australia to do some emergency medicine stuff come August take it you're out and then I'll be able to prepare for my USMLE and do all this kind of stuff until ready this decision that I made to take a break from Edison to deep medicine was made absolutely ages ago but it's just like because it just takes so long for the application process to happen it ended up being August see where I kind of left the job when my two years and is giving you the specifics online because I'm had Instagram saying that how can you feel okay with leaving medicine in the middle of a pandemic there's a lot to unpack there for the main one on I chose to make that decision to leave medicine away before the pandemic was even a thing and this is just how the system works in the UK you apply for training a whole year before you actually start training until me and most of my friends chose not to go straight into printer tray this was before the other reasons as to my thoughts around kind of leaving medicine in the middle of a pandemic I will say for later in the video or talk about why I'm going back but in terms of the background context that's one reason why I left medicine because it's a very natural logistical Korea Gap when you're in the it's not like we think hey screw medicine I'm going to leave I'm going to quit it's more like two years down the line you like okay cool I've got a natural career Gap where I now need to decide what Specialties go into I'm not a hundred percent sure of that. Let's take a step back that's hop-off D kind of rotating treadmill of medical training programs and let's assess where I want my life to go that was the logistical part about why I chose to be medicine 6 months ago is because like I really really really I'm sure what specialty I wants to go into number one and be I wasn't even sure if I wanted to stay in medicine at Ole Miss decision to go to med school with the decision that I made around about the age of 16 when I was choosing my a-level exams and because medical school is such a competitive admissions often people make that decision even before that point so like from the age of 13 or 14 I sort of had in the back of my mind that I might want to go to med school and so I started doing like Saint John's ambulance and volunteering for stuff and just trying to get my my resume up to the point have a competitive Medical School application pissed off about is like you know you decided to do medicine why are you not now seeing it through and the thing that I would say is that like I made this decision when I was like in my mid-teens and it's now been like 12 years since I've made and said to do medicine I think it's pretty unreasonable to expect a decision made at the age of 14 15 or 16 what you really don't know like I had no idea what the careers are out there like my mom's a few people in my family are Asian and you have a good day just like a standard thing in like most most my friends parents without his and it's hot nerd like genuinely when you're in that position what other possible careers are out there anyway I could be a doctor I could be a vet I could be a lawyer and an engineer and I really didn't have much scope for like water really when I was like 17 and friends of mine in school or applying to study history or English or math truth is like thousands of different jobs you could go into but me sitting there at age 14 to 16 I really didn't know that these kind of jobs exist if that's not to say that if I had known I would have changed my mind and I still think the decision to go to med school was one of them whatever and I don't regret a moment to that but in some ways I kind of prefer the American system here where are you kind of go through high school you go through college and then you decide what you want to but you know what you want your postgraduate qualification to be cuz you had that point you have a little bit more life experience few more things in the UK we have to decide 16 you know what you want your whole life career trajectory to look like and I personally don't want to be welded to a decision that I made when I was 16 and I don't want that decision to necessarily shakes unless I decide that it's actively what I want to do and to be honest rap medical school as well like I knew that it wasn't medicine itself that brought me fulfillment and joy and meaning the things that brought me fulfillment Joy meaning what number one teaching I used to really really really enjoy teaching and I still do that's one of the most meaningful experiences I have custody and secondly the thing that I enjoyed while in med school was building businesses on the side and coding in like doing website design are like launching a business and building a question bank and learning so besides scripting in like that's what the stuff that was what really brought me in medical school rather than the work that I was doing at self driving me there was like looking forward to coming home so that I my YouTube channel or I could walk in my businesses and those in a nice quote that I came across which is that which was along the lines of you know the thing that you think about in the shower should be the thing that you do with your life and if I think about like what stuff I think in the shower more about medicine it is always about like my side businesses are my YouTube channel on my website. The time when I was making the decision about do I want to go straight into medical training program this was really Weighing on me this idea want to look back at my life kind of 30 years from now and think damn you know that was like I don't want to regret sticking to that and while I'm young and while I've got you know lots of opportunities and wild my business is it make sense to take if I can actually think what do I actually want to do do I really want to stick with the decision I made at 8:16 or do I want to maybe switch to something else that was one part of it like I wasn't really sure if I want to stay medicine the second part of it was that if I did say medicine I really had no idea what special was going to go into I did upset tricks and gynaecology for 4 months and then because of the pandemic I screwed everything up I ended up staying on Obstetrics & Gynecology for another 4 months and when I went into it I kind of feel that maybe Obstetrics & Gynecology with something you want to do as a specialty further down the line but then through doing it for 8 months I kind of fell out of love with that and I realized that okay I've never tried this for 8 months and I don't really see myself becoming an electrician on Oregon ecologist do it. experience in cardiology Elderly Care Medicine general surgery Psychiatry and Obstetrics & Gynecology and I really couldn't see myself doing any of their Specialties and one thing that was in my mind is that a specialty that I enjoyed most of all the medical school Regency medicine like working in the emergency department we quoted accident and emergency A&E American school to ER the emergency room but I kind of like the lifestyle on the idea of working in emergency medicine the problem was I just didn't have any experience at all actually doing it the right now thinking like what specialty do I want to go to a good going to have any like a any emergency medicine is at the top of the list that's like committing myself to sort of 7-year training program in emergency medicine without actually having an experience of emergency medicine in deciding whether I like it seems It's a completely stupid thing to do and so over all that brings us to why I quit medicine it was because of the distinctly it made sense B I was intending to travel to Australia and like to do some emergency medicine and started making some inquiries about okay how can I get a job in Australia friends who done that swell and Sunday I like the idea of taking a step back I said reassessing do I really want to do medicine until maybe I want to travel the world of broaden my horizons Explorer stuff while I have the luxury of not really having any responsibilities not needing to worry about money YouTube channel an oldest active culminated to get me to this point in August 2020 where I was like cool that's my disa my lost as a doctor and I don't intend to go back until I figured out like what I actually want to do and that brings us to today 8 months into my unemployment away from Edison it's been 8 months since I've set foot inside a hospital still in the middle of a panda make where things are a little bit weird but recently I decided that I was actually going to go back into medicine and I decided that essentially when I what I've been thinking about what do I actually want to do with my life one exercise that I found helpful is kind of imagining 25 years from now what do I want my life to look like imagine life 25 years from now but if I think 25 years from now 10 years from now 15 years from now it like a sort of quiet long-term and I think what do I want my average week to look like as I imagine this I keep on landing on the idea still being a doctor but doing it part-time like I love the idea of doing medicine maybe two days a week maybe three days a week depending on how I'm feeling quite a lot like the through and through the last eight years of medical school and being a doctor become friends does audible come with them pay if you won the lottery would you still do medicine for fun and half of them say they would leave immediately and do something else and the other half say they would still do medicine but they would do it part-time and in my eight years of asking that question there is not a single person I've ever spoken to that if I won the lottery I would still continue to do medicine for fun full-time if you do it like 5 or 6 days a week more fun if you did it 3 or 4 days a week for example and so it want to think about what I want my life to look like I like the idea of doing maybe medicine two days a week maybe doing some like medical educational stuff like teaching at a local medical medical school one or two days a week the rest of my time making internet videos may be writing some books continuing to write on my website doing this sort of Internet entrepreneur type thing that when it comes to making decisions about what we want to do with my life I've been like three thousands of Studies have shown this we really need to study to know that we we are really really bad at actually knowing what we want until right now and thinking that hey it would be cool to work in medicine two or three days a week but I've never actually tried working in medicine to three days a week so I do I'll never know if that's what I want until I tried I tried waking you medicine 5 to 6 days a week and I know that that's not what I wanted so there's a big part of me that thinks okay if if my vision for the future is to do medicine to three days a week I should at least test that assumption to see if it's whatever you want to do Tim Ferriss talk about love in the 4-Hour Work Week like our default way of living life is to imagine that a kids need to work really hard and then when I'm 65 I will retire and then when I retire I'll be chilling on a beach and life will be good and what he says defer your retirement until the age of 65 try taking a few weeks off work and going to a beach and still sitting there and like try living your retired life and see if it actually brings you happen to see if it's what you really want and the way that he prices always like when you live that kind of life you realize hang on sitting on a beach and sipping cocktails all day is actually not that fun it gets pretty boring after awhile but if you work for 40 years with that vision of like hey one day I'm going to stay on the beach all day and do absolutely nothing you get to that point and you be like them I've waited I waited my whole life because this thing that I thought I wanted is no actually what I wanted and now everything's a bit weird and so the moral of the story there and what I already take from this is that when we think we want something we should test that assumption and so part of the reason why I'm going into medicine right now is because I want to test the assumption that do I enjoy working as a doctor 2 or 3 days a week part 2 of why I want to go back into medicine is because this I'm quite a utilitarian guy in the way that I am it's like cost-benefit analyses and like party why you know if someone says Hailey don't you feel guilty that you're not working in medicine in the middle of a pandemic the answer to that is no I don't feel guilty at all and the reason I don't feel guilty because of my kind of marginal impact on the world is so much higher making these internet videos and being a being a full-time YouTuber because it just affect so much so many more people in so many different ways then if I was just another doctor on the front lines just being a doctor like I'm I'm just a junior doctor I've been doing it for two years I have very limited experience I think I'm all right I think I have all right communication skills I quite enjoy it but there is really not much that Separates Me from other doctors which is kind of helmet supposed to work it. Like medicine is not supposed to rely on individuals standing out and being particularly amazing the system is supposed to be such that you can put anyone who is sufficiently qualified into the system and because of the evidence based processor the guidelines and everything like that how early the system will deliver a good outcome for the patient rather than individuals going above and beyond and delivering a good outcome for the patient and this is how a lot of successful businesses like McDonald's is a perfect example pausing between McDonald's and the healthcare system because the point is it's it's it's really all about the system that I think about McDonald's is that you get exactly the same experience whichever McDonald's you go to anywhere in the country or anywhere in the world because this system is so I am so well-tuned that you can put basically anyone with a small amount of training and a McDonald's uniform you can put them into the system and they will deliver a consistent result and that's kind of what medicine should be as well always be there is an element of like being nice to patients in like taking care but really the system is what gives the results rather than individuals and so if we do a utilitarian analysis of like Ali being a doctor Visalia not being a doctor is a slot into a an existing well-oiled machine just another Cog in that machine is really nothing special about me as a doctor I'm just as good or just as bad as any other doctor my my let my experience level and so I contribute very very sliding to being a cog in this like big machine but ultimately it's the machine that get it that give the patient the results element of if I'm not the coconut machine someone else will be the coconut machine like in the hospital that I am and there is occasionally a shortage of doctors but it's not like particularly dramatic it's not so dramatic that one extra doctor working part-time in the cyst actually going to make any difference in the way the system is designed it means gaps do get filled by extra shift to locums thing things like that so in dle being a doctor Road there is like my marginal impact is like very very very tiny as just being a doctor on the front line my marginal impact thanks to this YouTube channel and get the stuff I do is pretty high because if I wasn't doing this YouTube videos it's not like someone else would just take up my place and start doing YouTube videos I don't know trying to compare the impact of like making City internet videos with the impact Hibachi saving lives as a doctor but I mean like if it comes down to it it's like people don't analyses that on average in the Western World a doctor will save about eight lives throughout the course of their entire career if you go by estimates side get well which is a charity like analysis platform donating to the against malaria Foundation if I would $3,000 to that would on average save one life today against malaria Foundation I'm saving a life if I were to be deductive my whole career on saving a life to just with that analysis alone if I can make more money off of YouTube and because I've taken the giving away campsite which is where I give 10% of my income every year to charity Tri-State more lives by making money on the internet and giving that money to charity then I Do by working full-time as a doctor for the rest of my life that's what I like to visit the other aspect of it is like you know making videos like this it's very hard to it's hard to quantify the but if the messages and emails and stuff if they are anything to go by people email Amy emailed me saying that you know thanks x uo videos on how to study for my exam they're not going into med school and then I wouldn't have done it without this more no impact that I have making videos on the internet than I do as a cog in the machine so that is why I've never really felt guilty about not working in a pandemic but having said all of that there is still something qualitatively different about sitting camera and putting videos on the internet that's fine but like there is something that's much nicer about in person in traction this really doesn't need to be said but I do genuinely enjoy being a doctor and there is something nice about talking to patient to like being able to help people and having down to Ithaca cuz and that whole real life Community Vibe of being a doctor even though the impact of me being a doctor is like quite small compared to my pack on the internet there is still something there and so that's kind of Reason number two as to why I've been thinking for a while maybe I want to go back into bed soon cuz I'm not really getting that side of the Human Experience sitting here on in front of a camera with a light shining in my face making YouTube videos and part number three of wine back in the medicine is that I feel like my own she's my own life life experience and send stuff has been stifled in a way by just sitting in my flat for the last eight months making videos on the internet and being on Zoom cold all day if it wasn't for the pandemic I would have been proud the well that would have been done taking medicine maybe in Australia maybe New Zealand I would have done most of the especially because of the pandemic I feel like my whole life is getting up bingham's room cold all day making a video bingo more than cold playing World of Warcraft going to sleep and repeating the process for the last eight months and this is a huge part of me the things that like I don't want to be a professional influencer like I don't I actually don't want to be a full-time YouTuber it's not the life that I'm ashamed of myself and I think there's something more interesting about someone who is actually the doctor and using insights from that experience and having that life experience and then making videos about it rather than someone who assisted of the person that I've turned into which is I stay on my ass all day in front of the desk reading stuff and browsing Twitter and then I make videos about did I write it right in the front of the eyebrows like that's just so much less interesting than actually having real first-hand experience of doing stuff whatever that stuff is whether it's being a doctor or a lawyer in the world doing anything doing something and then everything been reading something and then told me about it and I feel like over the last eight months. I've become the sort of person who reads stuff and then talks about it I know I want to be the person who does stuff and then talks about it that's what that's why I want to go back into medicine and in fact in like mid-January I had a chat with one of the emergency medicine Consultants at my local hospital and I explain the time of your life some shifting emergency medicine I don't have any experience in it but like you know me and you know I'm breathing too legit can can you give me a soda pop time job and so now I'm pretty much just waiting for the paperwork to be sorted this is actually like surprisingly annoying like even though I've worked at this hospital before and they should have all my paperwork there still like a large amount of Hoops to jump through in terms of filling out forms and through six weeks later my criminal record check is still being processed by the criminal records people and I can't go back into working at the doctor until I have been cleared that I have no criminal record and for some reason this is just been think since like the 1st of February I know it's like middle of March with the last 6 weeks of taking ages to come through latinicity to get more experience want to see if I like it when I hang out with colleague going to get vaccinated stuff but my criminal record check is is causing some problems so that's kind of where I'm at thinking I was going to travel the world and explore my horizons and figure out what I want to do I realize that while iconic for the world and figure out what I want to do and so now I've decided I want to go back into medicine and see how I feel about emergency medicine as a specialty specialty I want to go into the future who knows do I like the idea of working part time at the doctor I think I would but I don't know I'm going to test that assumption it's okay we are today we sitting here explaining in this video why I left medicine and why I'm going back that's it nothing to do about it video you wanted to check out this video over here which talks about how I feel like I wasted the last six months of my life working on my book that's another kind of Remedy kind of sharing my feelings and stuff on videos similar to this one thank you so much for watching have a great evening and I'll see you again"

            "text": " in the video I'm going to talk to some of my favorite books of 2020 so we going to go with 10 fiction books and five fiction books Flash series that we have a million miles in A Thousand Years by Donald Miller now this is a really really good that made me cry and lots of places I'd also make me reconsider how I'm living my life it's about a dude who is a writer and a Hollywood film crew comes up to him one day and they wanted to convert his life into a film and then in the process of Henry living his life story and trying to figure out how I can become a film he kind of realizes that's the life he's been living is not particularly storyworthy like it's there's not much of a story behind it and he comes to this realization because he realizes that the life is that has actually been pretty easy he hasn't had any particularly difficult goals that he was driving to work and didn't need to overcome any conflict along the way to get there because the things that make a good story or a character that really want something and overcomes conflict to get it and you realize that that is also good life story so when I read this it was in the middle of the whole coronavirus lockdown thing in the UK and I remember I was reading it when an evening shift at work I was at work at the hospital until midnight and they're like three hours of the end of the day off to 9 p.m. where we just happen to have any patience so I just found the doctor's office I just started reading this and I was completely absorbed and I really started to think that in my own life maybe I'm living to comfortably and the things that I'm going off to Iran challenging or on challenging enough for this not enough of a struggle and then from this book it's like the story of this dude who is life of becoming a story and it's like very engaging and it's like a really good story but it also has a lot of interesting lessons along the way. Quote from the book somehow we realize that great stories are told in Conflict but we are unwilling to embrace the potential greatness of the story we're actually end we think God is unjust rather than a master Storyteller next on the list we have how to think more about sex by Alain de botton and I listen to this on Audible over the course of like to call Jenny's and it was it was really really engaging and also very entertaining and insightful in those different parts how to put this into words myself so I'm just going to read the excerpt which is in this rigorous and supremely on his book Alain de botton helps us navigate to be intimate and exciting yet often confusing and difficult experience that is sex supposed to be feeling rarely matches up with the reality this book argues that 21st century sex is ultimately fated to be a balancing act Between Love and Desire and adventure and commitment on the surface this is a book about sex but actually about so much more and it's about like the human connection and it's about like both intensity and vulnerability and all these cool things honestly I think this should be required reading for everyone like this is going to be on on my list of everyone should read this book books that I'm compiling at some point by the way keep up to date with all the books I'm reading you should definitely sign into my email newsletter which will be linked in the video description as a every time I read a book in 2021 I'm going to write a quick summary of it and I'll send out an email so if you're interested in getting insights from books in your inbox for free Saint Anthony's I said Lincoln video description is the Righteous Mind by Jonathan haidt and Addie a subtitle here is why good people are divided by politics and religion that it was really really really really interesting because the way that he he kind of explains our moral intuitions by talking about six different moral taste receptors and this was really interesting because as a storage liberal and left 8 myself I never quite been able to appreciate why some people Arkansas flash right-wing and all that kind of stuff but it's as if we all have the six different moral taste buds and different intuitive if you if you're liberal the rest of the Pharaoh conservative or if you're busted if you're somewhere along that Spectrum you respond these different moral taste buds in different ways and he explains that through his research and stuff if you are like me a liberal than youth you care very strongly about like two or three of these moral taste buds whereas in general if you were conservative UCare summer play about all six of those and that actually goes like for me what a very long way to explaining like just being able to understand more about how people on the other side of the political Spectrum how their views were shaped by what they we have the psychology of money by Morgan housel if you guys know money is one of my favorite topics and in this book he talks about how actually the way that we as humans treat money is not very rational and in fact you know tastes a lot on emotions and aloe on psychology and to me in the past I've always wanted to take a more kind of rational stones to with money, except for example something like you know paying off the mortgage on your own house is generally not Russian cuz you could get higher return in the stock market if you continue to have a mortgage but as Morgan housel is very well in the book it is even though paying off your mortgage is not rational I eat it's not the economically rational thing to do it is in fact very reasonable because help you sleep at night that was just like one of the Dozen different insides and I'm going to be doing a separate video specific about that book that will be linked up their butts out but it just really changed my view of money and things like saving and investing and salaries and also stuff about like ambition when it comes to money because he tells a little story the people who didn't I love the notion of the money and then threw it away or by doing illegal things on the procedure for money and is Aldi so it's a cautionary tales that I'm now starting to become more interested in because so interesting like this money thing is the thing that binds all of us together wherever we live stress about money is like one of the fundamentals of the human existence of The Human Experience and just being able to understand a little bit more about it was eye-opening and nice the book story worthy by Matthew dicks which I think is probably the single best book nonfiction book have read the year and as I was reading it I was taking notes in Camden Kindle highlights and stuff and I was saying I was saying to myself damn this is one of the best and most engaged I've ever read and it's a book about storytelling that's about how to become a better Storyteller but it's a lot more than just about storytelling and in fact he talked about how becoming a better Storyteller is actually the way of becoming a better listener to become a better so many different aspects of Our Lives. It's a skill that most of us don't bother trying to improve or even realize that you can improve it and it's already been this year that I've realized that I need to improve and storytelling and this book is one of the things has really helped in that way is also really good exercise that equals homework for life which is the idea that every night you spent five minutes just going over your day reflecting on your day and writing a few words to describe the most storyworthy moment of your day and I have been doing this for about three months so today when I read the book and it makes such a difference in my life not just in the sense that I could then tell more interesting stories because I have these written down actually now that I look back through my spreadsheet on notion where I was like cracking my story with the moment we say I can remember those few months between like May and July I can remember those months a lot better than I can remember the last three months when it slows down the passage of time whereas for the last 3 months where I haven't been doing his homework for life and not been ready reflecting on my day and right writing things out I don't know the time just would have blended into itself I guess I was sitting at home not going out sitting in front of the computer making videos but that's that's like about it and so moving forward I really want to keep on trying to do this homework for life every night because I know it'll help me a better Storyteller and therefore better conversationalist and therefore better social skills across the board but more importantly it'll help me you no experience life and enjoy life a little bit more putting the final five non-fiction books I'm just going to Blitz through because send emails about the stuff as it has already anyway. The first one is how to take smart notes by sohn TRN switch is all about how to take notes when reading and it was really really good and I enjoyed last we have the ride of a lifetime which is the autobiography biography Bob Iger who was the CEO of the Walt Disney Company for 15 years and that was really interesting was all about like you know his life and how he got started and how he became CEO and how he acquired like Marvel and fox and lucasfilm in these really interesting stories elephant in the brain which I've done an episode of book club about battling over there that's what about the hidden motives at all in our everyday lives and about how I actually a lot of the behaviors that we have is humans or about signaling and about stasis and about just trying to play state is game people and I was definitely like that definitely made me reflect a lot about what my own motivations were for doing things like this YouTube channel and running a business and being a doctor and stuff like toys a vascular surgeon based in London and who has been in loads and loads a different War zones over the last like 30 years doing like War doctoral type surgeries and think that was so good it's like a really engaging in thrilling story and you here how his experiences of being a surgeon on the front lines on a pie the frontlines by surgeon in the hospital in places like Syria and Libya and other like Warzone by places that was really pathetic recommending for everyone multiple negatives by a color which is all about like the interplay between race and class in Monday person I listen to that on Audible and it was directed by a column self and Izzy's like a spoken word poet I just gave me a pretty profound insight into things like what it's like to be black in person what it's like to be working class in person cuz either experiences that I don't have anybody help shape my view of the world there's so much more to say about it but favorite fiction reads of 2020 and we have to start with the series called The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan eye which was then finished the final three books by my favorite all-time Brandon Sanderson find Series has 14 books and I've been reading them since the mid 2019 and I finish them in March 2020 in April 2020 something like that and it's ready ready ready good it's it's hard to describe what I like from 14 book fantasy series is about but it's sort of like the three boys are in some tiny house Village and then like a wizard comes and tells them that they like the chosen ones and knock the darklord it off themselves and then they like Golden Venture and that sounds super super lame but it's actually so good and I thought the lost like four or five books in to take absolute masterpieces and I would look forward to driving to work each day and back because I could just listen to more we have time it was so so good if you knew to the fantasy genre which is a genre that I've been engaged in it since like 2017 if you need to it I wouldn't start with a we have time is a little bit slow and quite long so you kind of need to be a bit more versed in fantasy and being able to sit through large amounts of description and stuff to really appreciate it but mistborn by Brandon Sanderson book series by but you go quote six of crows again this fancy I reload I think every own for four out of the five books in this list all fancy like I said just like the best pics of crows it's about this gang of Thieves in like this sounds of a city and they each have their own life specialist skills like one of the main characters is the boss of the gang of Thieves and the other main character is like really like a gymnast so she can like in a scale walls and the place isn't what about they're basically trying to break in to like a super super super heavily guarded Fortress to rescue a scientist who discovered some like formula that create this drug that is going to completely take over the world just like a bit of magic and there's like a bit of a very short and it's it's very nicely packaged and then like a nice way I read six of crows one and two straight after finishing The Wheel of Time when call a my heart from one to be that I'm finished they temporarily talk to that hole that was that to my heart after I finish the wait time. Even have another book by Brandon Sanderson called elantris this is one of his Standalone novels again really good it's one of his earlier book so it's a little bit of a slower that is more modern stuff to accept but it was also really good and I was up until like 4 in the morning for about three nights in a row just like reading it cuz it was sick oh yeah what's it about Tikal interest with 10 years ago used to be like a superpower and they had people who could do magic and stuff but then something dark and evil happened and then the city became like you know decrepit and desolate Wasteland and it follows the story of like three different power tools how we going to one of them ends up in the city and ends up becoming a starts with his like a princess and then ends up becoming just like a random save / 7 in the city and the person that he's using Mary so his fiance rocks up to his and finds that he's actually dead in the summer Harley Race in 2018 TV series about it I don't see the TV series for the book was really good I think I read it in one sitting like I just started reading it one evening I just continue to read it until like 5 in the morning what is this book about it flows to teenager call Connell and Marianne and Colonel is like a super popular dude in high school and Marianne is like super nerdy unpopular in high school and cuddle and Mariana get together but like because he's the popular sports guy he doesn't tell anyone about it and he's like mean to her and stuff and then they both go to university the end up at the same University and then becomes like popular and pretty and stuff and then struggles to fan and so it's like their love story which is sort of intertwined and Isolde electroma and like mental health and insecurity it's really interesting and it was a very interesting insight into The Human Experience in a way that I just know quite appreciated before so yeah would recommend finally this isn't really a book this is actually I think it's like an audible what it's like a specifically designed as an audio program is gold the original and it's by Brandon Sanderson favorite fantasy with her again and Mary Cole and this is just like a it's it's like an a lost a few hours I think it's only like 4 or 5 hours and like a book by it's like specifically for audio and so disliked background music and sound effects and things as the narrator's on the writing it and this isn't to say it's more like science fiction it says that in the future in a world where people can get cloned and so the story goes that there's this woman who ends up murdering her husband and then the government decides to clone the woman and give her the Clone like you know this like artificial intelligence angry the code of her in every way gives her like martial arts skills and amazing like powers and she can like people's houses and stuff and her job is to track down the original like the original person I had to kill her and then take over her life and again that probably sounds lame but it's really I was visiting Oxford with a friends have like a three hour drive each direction from from Cambridge and like the drive was so good cuz my friend was asleep and I was just listening to the original all the way there and all the way back and it was absolutely incredible so that would be my final recommendation link to the video description so it does non-fiction and five fiction books that I enjoyed in 2020 because every time I read a book summary of the book check out this video over here which is about the three books the most change my life I've been watching happy New Year and I'll see you tonight.

            "text": " and it's going to be talking about the five key principles of productivity ccor and 8 that when I discovered them a few years ago pretty much overnight that is immediately made me more productive and made my life a lot less stressful Leon the doctor based in the UK and on the channel to explore the strategies and tools to help us live healthy and happy and productive life and this video is going to be one of the 25 lessons in my brand-new skiltrek laws about productivity we're going to be looking at David Allen's amazing book called getting things done literally the Bible of productivity and when I discovered this book a few years ago it completely changed the game for me and my own productivity system as of today that cost is now available on skillshare whoever that means is that the first one trial of skill share during that trial that you can watch like the other five causes of a low voltage on skillshare up to about productivity to a bad study for exam one about stoicism kind of techniques that made me happier and one about how to edit videos exactly like this one using Final Cut Pro skillshare is amazing platform that's thousands of passes and also the topics from creativity to entrepreneurship illustrations graphic design to cooking but you definitely and then you can watch other people like a friend Thomas friend who has on productivity is less than $10 a month it is totally worth it I pay for it even though this one's my videos and I'll use skillshare as my first go to place whenever I need to learn anything but some people please hit the link in the description you can watch the entirety of my productivity if you don't then here is this excerpt which is I think like 9 minutes long poking about the five key principles of productivity from David Allen getting things done I hope you enjoy it getting things done which is a soda productivity methodology name Daltrey book on productivity looked as most transformed my own productivity and there are millions of people around the world who is to say exactly the same thing like if you rent productivity you you have to read getting things done there is just no substitute for it I'll do a dedicated go check out if people are interested because I think 35 step process to getting things done which organ talk about now getting things done is that we will have lightened and the more the more you get into the woodwork like the more you realize you have black wheels all of these different kind of commitments we have this different toudouze we have all these things on calendar we have all these areas of our life that we want to kind of sustained wheels of don't just want to be effective it was going to be effective at home and at school and University with a friends things that I like to track an organized and often were storing all these things that I had and therefore we get frazzled and we become overwhelmed with the amount of stuff we have to do and so getting things done ottb for short gives us a system for organizing all of these commitments in a life and effectively Islands main point is that disorder to rounds what you want to organize this horizontally means that across all the things that were involved in we kind of want to keep them very tidy like we want our work life but we know we have to do when iPhone left because holiday we want our relationship you want to maintain horizontal coherence across the board but also we going to be thinking vertically and keep things tidy vertically but if he means within a given project or given area we want to efficiently and effectively get stuff done that moves us towards a particular goals for those that's a lot more in the book about if you want to read it five step process to GTD and that's capture our file organizer reflect and engage CCO re-capture reflect and engage storing them and a big reason is because we are using our brain as a to-do list we don't really have a dedicated system in which to offload is an offload things that we have to do so the main point in Step One capture is that any open loop in a mind anything we have to do anything that's one of mind we write it down and put it somewhere and sit with me for example I'm completely obsessed with caption I think for me it's been the single most important thing that give me more productive and less stressed in general which is that the instant I have an idea for something I need to do or something I need to remember or something somewhere now usually I use the app things on my iPhone to write this down do this time if it's an audio for video of ocean if I'm driving a brain draft I'll go to videos my YouTube channel where I talk more about the capture have it but the way it works is that anytime I'm finding my brain trying to remember something that person's email you know which is an idea I might have well and I'm doing the groceries I kind of have a bit of an allergic reaction cuz I I think there is no way this is staying in my head because I'm just going to forget forget about it because I'm a total dumbass and I don't trust my brain to remember any so I will always write it down and that's kind of the first step is that a big part of why we're very stressed about everything and we have is because we don't have a centralized trustworthy system we might use it to do this but often we don't use out to do this for 100% of the things we actually have to do we would maybe use a to-do list to 70% of them but when it comes to it's my mom's birthday next week and I should get her birthday card and a present we would like that we would just or no heads was what they saying is that every single thing in your life you want to capture and you want to offload into an external system an apple paper what kind of whatever you want to do and once you once you have 100% coverage that means you trust your system rather than relying on system + brain is that often procrastination a black of protiviti comes from not having a clearly defined next step and when it comes to rising to do this we are all notoriously bad at actually clarifying what each step means so for example on my to do list if I was doing this like how we used to do it I probably have website redesign on my to-do list project to that task it it's it's it's not very well Define SOB audio of terrify is we want to convert all about to do list into action was so freaking pool website redesign is a multi-step process by the first part is probably develop mood board on Pinterest using web design inspiration sticking a boat step two would probably be create mock-up in sketch which is a web design app showing structure website so there's a very very specific things which are within the general project of website redesign cephalon capture everything but stuff to clarify and make sure we've got a specifically defined next actually going to be doing then we have step 3 which is organized and put stuff where it needs to go so if we have reference materials for me from email we want to put it a folder in Evernote or notion of whatever you want to use I use notion Press today and if we put these items not to do this we want to organize them into projects in areas and then we probably want to organize them by kind of priority and deadlines these bits of metadata like a Jew date and who clothes and stuff like that we add those things it takes a little bit longer but it keeps a whole system organized as a whole and that is one of the most important jobs of the engineer stand before in GTD is reflect review and that's when we come into doing things like weekly reviews month more on that in a later video in this class and finally step 5 is engaged which is to actually do the thing can I look through a list which is now 100% covered across-the-board we don't have any information in our heads that is kind of keeping us up at night system and then with choosing to do the things that are going to make us the most effective so that's just a very quick Whistle Stop tour through the five steps. Organize reflect and engage depending on when you watching this already be out so look at my profile and look at that cost discovering gcd has been the single biggest change to my productivity like in my life I think I first read it in my first or second year of University and I thought them I've been hearing Salon I can't believe 104 I'm literally everyone I know who's into productivity also swears by DTD because it's literally the Bible you got to read the book if you care about productivity don't know what to do to stop a computer or Apple notes whatever you want to use just write down a list of every single thing that is on your mind as like a to-do list so it can be anything like you know figure out furniture for my balcony or figure out website send thank you card to friend for dinner or anything that you've got on your mind when you try and capture and put on this on the piece of paper on this list are like most people will have between 30 and 100 things if you're a normal person and every time I do this what's my productivity even though I'm upset with capture I still have so many open Loops so many things. I've been thinking about that just been weighing on my mind as soon as I get them out of my system suddenly I feel a sense of so from this video make a list every single thing right now it really doesn't matter which one I promise you you will feel a sense of relief step number one about engineer doing its job said thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next four thousand people hit Link in the description you can sign into a free 2 months just your heart's content that's it yeah if you like this video and I want to see most of this on YouTube video care which is productivity equation and that's where I talk about the amazing equation for productivity that you can use to Target specific interventions that to help you leave a tell you happy more productive life or something like that thank you so much for watching"

            "text": " this video is sponsored by Squarespace whether you needed the main website or online store make it with Squarespace official smart keyboard folio thing which definitely could be named a lot better because it doesn't roll off the tongue but I absolutely love this thing I've been using it every day at work for the past few months since getting the iPad Pro and I think it's absolutely incredible think about it and then we'll end with a little discussion about who I think would benefit from this 180 lb glorified keyboard about it I think this is the best type appearance I have ever used on any device ever just typing on it just such a lovely beautiful thing the keys feel amazing the keys are have this kind of like fabric coating to them that is not as like cookie as a Pro keyboard and it just feels a feel that such a joy to talk when I get to the point where I pretty much used as for any kind of typing thing that I can anytime I do have to type on my MacBook or on my Apple magic keyboard I feel bad that I'm typing on those rather than talking on this experience it's it's kind of hard to describe but it's just it's so nice and it just feels really good like once you've used one of these keyboard you will never want to use anything else ever again for typing anything ever apart from the amazingness of the toppings all the things I like about it or how easy it is to get setup so this is the default camera position for it and then you know if you want to just bang angle angle because it's is quite nice for having on a desk and then being able to talk stuff I kind of wish I had more of a kind of like the old appliques had like a 15-degree sort of like this writing angle so you could right stuff with the apple pencil on it if you want to but sadly that's not the case with this one except for this one if I do need to switch from planting to apple pencil I just do that I'll just lay it flat and this listen to be like a thing where you're just kind of resting it about to Wrangle but it does end up being kind of whatever you want to do apple pencil rather than it being fully flat it's just very slightly angulated in this particular migration and then you close it take it up and go to say is I have spilt so much stuff on this case I carry on my lunch tray whenever go to lunch and still like Korean stuff in it sometime today even still drinks on it lives it's been tucked in my bag it's been totaled over the place and you can see like fingerprints on it cuz I didn't even using this every single day for the last few months but Signa florist let's talk about those now so what do not like about this I don't really like the fact that when you fold it over like this if you just want to hold and then you get off the feeling of the keys behind your fingers I don't do this very often but when I do kind of feel that this could have been better designed even though the keyboard is amazing I still get a bit annoyed when I'm having to act like John my fingers against the keys there so I like this it's very easy to detach you have your amazing iPod and it's all its Glory Fitness with the paper like screen protector on it. My favorite screen protector Link in the description and then if I want to I can just sit back in it was open and get back to doing whatever I was doing which is pretty ideal kind of keyboard thing on the back of the other thing I don't like about this is the color I like a kind of A Cut Above everything else but this if you sold it it just looks like a you know Samsung tablet that they might provide two people at some Enterprise and when you open up this doesn't look like an iPod anymore because it's not the iconic home button so that's not a big deal and the best I've ever made but it just he just doesn't really look like an Apple product essentially I think that if you have an iPad Pro obviously and you do any sort of typing that you want to be able to do in your iPad then this is fully worth 180 lb investment that you're putting into this Smart Keyboard folio it does transform the iPad from you know a cool little device that you can browse the internet on what Netflix only use the apple pencil on it transforms. To something that is almost a laptop replacement if you use the keyboard if our student and I have the iPad Pro that I probably would get the key so just because we're such a small kind of expense rather be speaking to the culture like you know this like 11 or pounds the keyboard is going to be about a hundred eighty for a relatively small cost you transform the capabilities of the iPad into like from an iPad to almost a lot but I think that if you don't do a lot of typing on you primarily use your iPad as a consumption device so for watching stuff and occasionally maybe using apple pencil then you probably won't regain much by having the cable with the cable to just such a great talking experience that value piping I'd like a thing then it's absolutely worth getting time to me like the main thing I found from having the keyboard is now that when I have a spare moment at work I can quite easy reply to emails I can reply to messages I can even reply to Instagram DMS cuz of the Instagram app call Jenny or train journey or even on an airplane or pretty much any time or I have is a few minutes I can vouch open bear my note taking app and stop pounding out the script for a future YouTube video which is exactly what I did on the flight back from Sudan a few weeks ago I just had if I don't have the keyboard I think I mean I would have tried to plan on some videos using apple pencil in that would have worked but it's just so much easier just to type out a whole script a whole plan for video when you have a keyboard so to me I found that it's increase my productivity one-time-only iPad is made me able to reply to email. is more quickly and it means that when I get home I've been able to treat out of my inbox and all this other stuff while I have been at work and what on my lunch break and all that so yeah overall I think a hundred pounds this is definitely added more than a hundred. value to my life as an experience get this you won't be disappointed if you don't value typing as an experience we don't use your iPod to type lots of stuff and don't worry about the cable is not really going to add anything that case that looks a bit more Pro that looks like this video just want to say a big thank you to Squarespace for being a today's videos for Squarespace as you probably know is an oil platform for websites to Mains and online stores that have some incredible and I'm actually redesigning my own personal website using Squarespace they've got designer of templates to choose from and you can customize those to your liking and go 24/7 customer support everything just kind of works really nicely together and actually one of the things that use my iPad for these days is that every time I read a book on my Kindle or anything else then I write a book review of it in Utah on my iPad Pro I use a keyboard to type it because it just makes typing such a nice experience on the plan is once I get my Squarespace website up and running all upload order my book reviews to a separate section of the website will my tech put up reviews to separate section my blood blisters after section and Squarespace make it so easy to have these post types I have different different layouts for each one and have different images for each one and using the iPad to create content for my Squarespace Squarespace and when the time comes to find a paid subscription you can get 10% off by using my special code which will be in the video description so thank you very much goodbye"

            "text": " when I was 12 years old I had this dream of making money on the internet now 13 years later and with a ton of failures and experience under my belt I make over three times as much money from the internet on the side as I do in my full-time job as a doctor in the NHS the UK National Health Service this is the video I wish I would have had when I first got started hey friends welcome back to the channel if you knew here at my name is are they in on this channel we explore the various principles strategies and tools that help us live happier more productive lives and we're talking about money in this because bus emo people to do it and secondly because money is such a massive source of stress in most of our Lives we often feel like we don't have enough to bet most of us trade more than 18,000 hours of Our Lives a huge chunk of our full-time on this Earth to go to work so we can make money I need to let being able to make money online outside of a day jobs is pretty cool that means that if we're lucky enough to be doing a job that we love than happy days we've got some spare cash to go on holiday with but if maybe would not entirely happy with working 4280 hours then we put the option of going part-time old taking a job that pays less but that we enjoy more or even to stop working altogether if that's what we want. Obviously this isn't an overnight thing I ate a lot of time and effort to get to the point where we can quit our jobs and stick it to them but to be honest I don't think anyone watching this would say no to having an extra few hundred dollars a month kicking around and the process of getting that isn't as mysterious as it can sometimes feel basically three legit ways of making money online but before we go there what money actually is a poem from the early nineteen hundreds that goes as follows money is a matter of functions for a medium a measure a standard a store is just a medium for exchanging value money to buy things that we find valuable and so if we want to make money will make money online we need to be providing some kind of value that someone else is willing to pay for this basically three forms of value that people will pay for of the internet and these are all three levels of make money on another level 1 Services level 2 product and level 3 attention I've been doing variance of all three of the last 13 years like I started off sitting services as a web and graphic designer I then moved to what selling products approximate school applicants and now it's mostly through the attention that I've gone platforms like YouTube that I can leverage to superpower the sale of services and product and those are sold at the three levels of making money online make money online by sending you service this one's probably the easiest way of making money online it's one I recommend everyone we need to develop a skill that people are willing to pay for and secondly we need to find people who are willing to pay for that's guilt Step 1 skills that others are willing to pay for if you thinking that I told myself HTML CSS which of the basic the markup languages of website and then because I wanted to make a video game for my nerd friends I just have to teach myself PHP which is a service light programming language in 2006 with just free information on the internet way back when listen software thing so you can pretty much learn anything online for free these days this hundred ways you can learn how to code online I'd recommend starting with the basics of HTML and CSS I following random Youtube tutorials Hope by paying for something like codeschool or codecademy build your own personal website coding I'd recommend the introduction to python course over a brilliant was wondering this video will tell you more about them laser online how to grate there are literally hundreds if not thousands of different things that people will pay you for some of them are related to doing stuff on the computer like coding and websites and graphic design and illustration and stuff but there's no other things like writing and copywriting and dislike this whole world of stuff that you can do on the internet wherever you are in the world pretty much as long as you have a reasonable internet connection another easy ish one to learn is video editing if you want you can check out my skills. Claus and how to edit videos in Final Cut and also working through that you'll be pretty good it's like not having a monetizable skill is not an excuse anymore assholes if you want to actually make money online because you can literally teach yourself anything over the internet and then you can sell that skill to other people just have to find people who will pay you money skillo service not this to sort of people who will pay you for your service is essentially a people in real life or secondly people names that start with people in real life I learn how to make website so I was 12 13 and then I sent an email to like my email contact and told my friends that I was going to be designing website has really terrible looking Banner thing to advertise my services I have my home phone number and I have time anymore we moved houses anytime since then website built into my first website that I made what does Genki looking HTML CSS thingy that I made for my mates. He paid me 30 pounds for it so that was pretty solid the internet know I got my start in a website called ghetto coder.com where you know people would post project saying they need a web designer or developer to do these various things and I would bid on those projects and say I'll do it for $10 I'll do it for $5 I would basically everyone else in the market because I was like 12 13 and for me 5 or $10 would like oh my God I'm rich these days the sky's is like app work in fiber that seemed to be the biggest ones and you can just going to browse through all the different things people are looking for and then you can tell yourself that you can say you get better at the thing you can start charging more and more especially as you start getting decent reviews and you start building up your own portfolio of whatever the thing is that you're doing until I did this whole selling services thing for a few years but I realized pretty quickly ultimately what I was doing is I was trading my time for money and that's ultimately not very scared of a bottle because I wasting my time or time is is limited and so if you really want to make money online that we going to get to level two level to make money online by selling products what is top selling products like physical or digital good when your ability to make money online magnifies a lot because it suddenly becomes available like it's not directly tied to the amount of time you putting it out if we want we could sell pretty much anything online but all I do is think of you want to sell it something that has a one-time cost of time and money to make that we can sell infant copies off and we won't be close to reproduction to be zero and ideally Wendy costume distribution to be zero an ugly we won't be ongoing time commitment to be as low as possible so we can make the thing and then we can sell it like a million times without having to spend too much more time so the audio product category than is digital Goods on digital product anything from a website to an app for an online course or an ebook or these things have a one-time cost of production 0 coaster reproduction Zero Custom Distribution and hook blade a zero cost of Maintenance as well level two basic is selling other people's products not this very different ways of doing this but just to simplify precarity the two that we going to talk about today off Thursday dropshipping and secondly affiliate marketing let's start with dropshipping the basic idea is that we could make a pretty looking website nice-looking watches let's say for a hundred pounds apiece when a customer orders that watch we then buy it from a third party without you having to watch and we arranged them to ship it to the customer so we're making 50 lb without ever handling the watch until I've never really done this and I would recommend you probably stay away from it as well just cuz I've seen so many kind of online courses that seemed to seem a little bit Sky me about how you can make money online by dropshipping I also don't like the fact that dropshipping generally focuses on physical goods and as we talked about physical because you actually have to pay for it you have to arrange the logistics of the shipping it's just a mess of Bullock we're at digital products ready all the way to go to the second way of selling other people's products is with affiliate marketing affiliate marketing stuff pretty good review website called Wirecutter and they've do reviews about the best electronics in different categories and they have Amazon affiliate link so when someone clicks a lot Lincoln Vice from Hamilton NY to the website will make 1% and 2% 3% I think you get enough visitors buying enough things you can make a lot of money from affiliate marketing or you can do what I do which is to have affiliate Partnerships with certain product like the receipt paper like screen protector who I've been evangelizing for the last two years because I genuinely love the product and so if someone buys a paper like screen protector for the iPad Pro using minding I will get some percentage Commission on that sale and if enough people doing that that can make a reasonable amount of money you sending someone else's stuff but you're getting a percentage Commission on the if you're interested in learning more about this that they do. level 2 expert level 2 expert is one with selling our own products it was telling our own self then we control everything from the Aesthetics to the price to the distribution to the logistics that is the entire customer experience things you can sell you could try selling physical product manufacturer distributor Logistics loaded money I wouldn't recommend any physical products thing it's something I'm kind of looking into myself when it comes to setting March but it's it kind of hard and I think personally more trouble than game or something and people buy it from the App Store you're making money off of that lets you making website that's offering some kind of service and you're charging people like subscription fee or something to access to that serve it this is something that my brother and I did in 2015 we both know how to code in the summer of 2015 we built an online question back. In the UK applying to medical school taking the seven exams and so we charge people to access to the question back and through the platform they could do the questions I can walk around his right they could see Solutions problem with this whole I want to build a website and make money off of that is that is really quite hard to do in general you need to know how to code using you want to find some co-founders you can go down the store separate this the very first thing you should do probably shouldn't be to try and get rich off making up is really very hard and it's kind of a more advanced way of doing things is I think a much easier way that anyone can make money online and that is by selling in food products so button for product I mean things like ebooks downloads online courses because if you can teach something and you can teach it in a compelling an interesting way online increasingly it's becoming easier and easier to find people who willing to pay you full that online education online education so if you can't eat something you can make money off of that so it with me for example I've got a series of online courses aimed at medical school applicants that teach them how to do all of these exams in Med School interviews so that makes some money every week every month by setting online without me having to pay any more at the end I want to go online courses how to edit videos and a class on how to study for your exam and generate passive income i e i put the effort into creating the post once and then it's just setting itself repeatedly without me having to do much else full of expertise that then means you can teach the thing I don't think therefore I can teach online but you can because if you're a beginner you can teach all the beginners right now if you think you could very easily so if you're free for the Scotia what's my clothes and how to edit videos in Final Cut Pro and then you can make your own post for complete beginners and it's so easy to learn anything online and then you can make an online class teaching that thing to other people and if you want you can send it through your website or if you want you can what's the different platforms you can sell your expertise on and as long as it's good always have to be good because you know we make money online by providing value if it's invaluable then people buy it make all of the digital product the problem is we still need to find people who are willing to part with their hard-earned cash to buy the thing that we're trying to sell them so how do we do that and that's what level 3 comes in level 3 is when we super charge on money Powers with attention they're always that you can get your product in front of people you can send a cold email online I got the attention of people who know like and trust you and by far the easiest way of getting people to know like and trust you is by providing valuable content on the internet completely free of charge for example if you want to do right now you can stop about productivity tips and every week you could write one or two blog post sharing your favorite productivity tips from books formatting papers from articles from podcast from urine and overtime if you do this consistently and provide value because again we all care about body if there's no snow we can tell you if there is no shortcut to make money online you're providing value for free across the internet over a long. Of time and then in three years time you build a mailing list of 20,000 people and now when you want to run your own productivity course you've got this meeting list of 20,000 people who No Lie can trust you from the value that you've given them for free over an extended. Of time and now they're far more likely to buy you a thing you've got an audience of people that you can sell to other God from Gary vaynerchuk who you should definitely be following across every single social platform if you care about making money description of a book called jab jab jab Right Hook and the middle. Is that a job is like, I think a job is when you give someone content and valuable content for free and a right hook is when you off them nothing will try and sell them something and he said that interviews. Actually he wished he could have pulled the book......... Free content vs. paid content needs to you need to be providing 25 pieces of valuable free content for every right hook that you're watching every time you often someone to buy stuff and revisit the exact Playbook wood would forward that I've been following with this YouTube channel since 2017 I've been found Tim Ferriss who are the time by just flooding the market with a ton of ready valuable free content not really worrying about trying to charge people to things and then later on you know once you've got disoriented people I can trust you to do that now for me if I want to sell them online course if I want it I want some actually have this audience of 600,000 people who are willing to hear my message and will be far more likely to buy the thing from me if you can build up that pistol brands that professional reputation that this audience of people that know that I can trust you at that point you a super charging your abilities to make money online because now you can sell Goods now you can sell services and in fact you could even sell attention directly but the people that piss and there's just like completely changing when you got the huge audience that you can leverage to make money online. Big runs one about marketing any shows that even with a very small amount of people if you could the Right audience following you you could easily sell a product as a Geico Kevin Kelly who wrote a famous essay where if you can just get a thousand people falling Union and those are your true fans those are the people that that's your musician that the people who will you know go to every show there buddy special edition of your album if you can get a thousand people who like you enough to potentially pay you $100 a year for the stuff that you make you're making $1,000 a year you've got a full-time living from a thousand true fans and so the audience doesn't need to be that big but the way you're feeling any kind of audience as Gary vaynerchuk content parasite is to just produce a ton of radio valuable free content over a long. Of time if I give away content for Free People Want by my paystub people will buy a vape stuff but only if you give them something for free you don't build an audience by selling stuff you build an audience by giving them a load of stuff for free and then you can sell to them 3 years down the line right now I'm at the point with passive income where I'm I make so much more money on the side through these online activity through selling Goods services and attention online and I do my day job working 60 hours a week of being a doctor in the UK years ago when I decided that I wanted to be a super nut and learn how to code and so if you watching this right now you're thinking that you want to maybe start this do any one thing. Really recommend is that you learn how to code yes in this day and age you don't absolutely have to learn how to code but it's it's a really helps if you're trying to sell any kind of on a software product online and honestly the best place I'd recommend to code it first date teach yourself HTML and CSS using random free tutorials on YouTube you can learn HTML in a single day you can learn CSS into you can fly building your own personal website then once you've done that you should definitely go to bring it after that one line quotes on learning Python and the fundamentals of the Fantastic online platform for meth side and the introduction also they're kind of advanced python courses already good at learning python which is the world's most popular programming language you can do anything from making a website that gives people access to do the thing that me and my brother did sounds good you should head over to Whole Foods naturally and the first 200 people to click on that link look at 20% of the annual premium subscription online read the books I recommend and then I promise you'll start on your path to the internet but thanks for watching and seeing"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him on a ventilator I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this episode of medical Mondays would taking a deep dive into The Graduate medicine application so I interviewed a friend of mine called Summer she is a third-year Grant Medical Cambridge and we had a really real long and very nice conversation what we talked about all the aspects of the crowd medicine application all the way from what makes a good application to the kind of stuff you should be doing while you're doing your degree to personal statement entrance exams how to prepare for the grad medicine interview questions that you blessed buy Instagram so this is quite long, hopefully going to be very useful for people applying to grad medicine also timestamps to everything we're going to talk about is going to be linked in the video description so you don't have to watch this whole video you can just kind of skip a long sleeper protection whatever you feel like outside yeah that's it for me I hope you enjoy the conversation between me and some about The Graduate medicine entry application just kind of take a chronological view of the whole crowd entry medicine thing and then at the end once we talked about that will do a few Q&A from Instagram and see what sort of questions people asking about medicine and then you decide you want to go for medicine or you already decided prior to that they wanted to know if medicine beating an offering you into being volume at whatever I might do people have different ways into it thinking about applying to I agree that eventually I'm going to be taking medicine and say they sort of going to the undergraduate degree with the mines that all I need to be during this time during we got the grades to go into an ulcer I'm building so then people are doing like later societies loads of extracurriculars and loads of research and things and that's that time to make that application I think the main sort of thing that grad medical applicants have in comparison to undergrads Africans is the research because you know undergrads wouldn't School you wouldn't have that much opportunity to do proper research little cries when they're applying they possibly already called Publications and things and is that like a requirement because what if people do like an English degree or something sometimes are open to apply at applicants of all backgrounds so for example noise complaint Cambridge they allowed anyone to apply so you don't have to be someone with a by Sciences degree universities already prescriptive about what they want so I seen some University applications which are like you need to send us a list of exactly what modules you took because they need to match up to the content they expect you to have covered in you on the ride decide where you want to be looking at different aspects such as fun things such as you know who takes what sort of degrees to how long the actual degree is his son graduate he has enough I guess and that can affect funding and things so you go to redo your reset my city doing biomedical Sciences UCLA somewhere around the mother and I know that for the underlined I want to apply to medicine so am I aiming for first causes and everything like what what are the soda grade requirements and would anyone still care about my a-level chemistry components spring yes so a little chemistry and makes a difference in a lot of places so make sure you check whether that is a requirement and sometimes they have a weird sort of timescale on it as well they want you to have done a level chemistry within the Lost if you took it before the seven years you can have to redo it more heat if you'd probably be to apply somewhere else in times of the first pop your question which was I'd like to what extent does it matter if I come to the year old get a first-class or get a 2-1 the better you do the more chance that you have of getting in when you are applying for graduate medicine if you are applying from your final year so you have a Nike graduation yet that for you don't actually know what what you want the degree classification is that you're going to get you'll be predicted your degree classification biocheese at you today so you thought would be what is used in your looking for medicine so ideally you should be predicted the first class because that is the thing that will help you get into you because as I was going to say they draw the numbers of what matter in private medical since the case that such few places in the country for graduate medicine the number of people applying Puppy Place is like almost double what are playing for undergraduate medicine so it's much more competitive and so in that sense being pretty bust for your degree would definitely help you got place for interview but eventually it doesn't really matter because most places only required to have go to one but if you'll predicted that you want it's less likely that you'll get an interview so you want to be pretty too fast but once you got that place usually that offer that they give you is you need to get a 2-1 in your degree Hall okay so you need to cut it what about kind of aiming for top of your stuff like that does that. That is no requirement anyway it's just with Edibles like if you came top of you yet and you know yet I see no whatever it's not like a requirement on medical applications but it just makes you look pretty good similar to when you applying for undergraduate medicine so it would be good feet have arranged so do GP do Hospital a lot of rides actually who haven't just come from a degree so they've been doing other things like why can things they actually work such do things like health care assistant roles and things for like a whole year which gives them so much experience already and then it really looks good or not acacian as well so if you have the time to do that and if you're willing to do that for a whole year of your life yeah things like that great extracurriculars do universities care if you would like to know captain of school University cricket team on undergrads as an undergraduate applicants I can't even fix that you've proven that you'll tried-and-tested at University you can handle University life and you'll not only a handle University level what but you can also contribute in a healthy way to university life and get back to the university and and participate in the community go to go to the grade I'm going to a city Smasher out of the park in terms of my grades I'm going to do some kind of research project you know if I can find get publication will to I'm going to do some extracurricular activities make sure I contribute to the Water Corporate life of the university and then I get to my final year at when I apply to grad and it sounds like I need to spend after the age of going all the websites of all the different universities that have made a table on page unlike a naval page of a website soda tab e-lite it for you they've already got all the info so they've got listed like that medicine universities that offer the cools and then they've got like how many places they have what entrance exam they require that sort of thing so it could have probably quite easy information already online universities Is it feasible for me to apply to and then once I do that shortly so I can narrow it down and you can apply to both Oxford and Cambridge three different entrance exams last time I checked if things have changed but when I was applying that was being naughty cake at against that and I think again you should take that as a very strategic decision about whether it's so for example if you're applying your yes you go to be juggling you know you're finally a dissertation and other things like that as well as their new medical applications which is a lot tougher than doing you available to be honest so you go to make a decision about how many times you going to be prepping food and how many going to put in the effort for Sobe Mountain you take at sometimes if you were one of those people who did apply and initially didn't get in and then you did something else and then decide to do still gave medicine you probably already got some kind of experience with either Ryobi metal both so it's sometimes good to just stick with what you know. Is another kettle of fish because it's a lot more effort it's it's like a whole day to do as well so it's a lot of effort and I think a little prep has to go into it as well so it's just about how much pressure you're willing to take one and how much you wanted to diversify your choices I guess get messages from people saying oh you run courses for the beam at UK at 6 medical you can't you can check them out but like I don't know anything about the gums then science says so you go to I think have a good knowledge of your body chemistry physics so yeah it's quite heavy on the sort of scientific content I think there is an essay as well so yeah it's just like a series of exams that you have to take any breaks in between but I don't know much more than that because I decided I wasn't going to be the games that and put in the effort so I didn't do anything that donut I've got first in all of lifetimes ago some sick extracurriculars to start a YouTube channel become a magician on the side just to kind of boost my application and applying and I apply through you why's you should I mean if we took about whether you go to do or not yet it's the same what makes like a legit personal statement for grad you've done an undergrad you've got more experience than the kids are applying for the kids aren't experienced so the thing that really stands out I think is one if you've done extra research so for example idea 3 lab internships I think in my undergrad during my son is on Christmas and things so that was a lot of experience so I could talk about that I'm pretty sure that her 18 year old would have and secondly want to talk about Society some things that you've done at University because that's what if you'll hey I'm a proven University graduate country to to university life I you know I was president of XY that I was present off while I was Fight Club I think I was present yes it was a women's fitness Society at Kings that I can flour Don about why I wanted to Medicine in why I kind of being a grad it's like the best thing ever now let's hear back and I got three offers for interview way that they do Van Der weide when I was applying for Cambridge my Cambridge interview I thought would be either one of those scary College ones where you got the academic Quantum the normal one but actually was an MMI and I think a lot more universities are moving to anime just because I think it's Farrah and you know if you got the 11th how many stations I decide to do at Cambridge with 11 stations dr. I've liked it even split between you know you'll reason behind study medicine what you'll experiences have taught you like or why you know why did you awake friends make you want to become a doctor or what did you learn from it and you know this kind of things usually yeah yeah lyrics of applying so just sometimes yes she is the important part because this is something you do as an eighteen-year-old applying for undergraduate medicine you kind of go to open days and you have a good feeling about the compass that you're at what's the what's the strategy for playing to which universities offer the most places Festival because it's so variable I think Warrick has the only course in UK that Justice graduate medicine where is most of the places do Underwriters they main course and then offer a few places for graduate medicine so I think I definitely apply to work because they had crazy like nearly a hundred Paces which forgot your medicine is crazy mood faces off of between 20-40 places so I applied to wear it and then I looked at yeah how many of how many places that they offer how many people actually fly to those universities and how many out of those apply actually get given an interview once you go through that love math then what to get to interview stage how many out of the ones that were given to you at to get a play so I worked out that once I go through that whole initial Maspeth Cambridge that if I had managed to get to interview stage I then had to knock out to other people to get a place there are threatened I think that's probably to do with a bit of The Prestige with applying to Cambridge and it's a bit scary and people's think oh no that's not for me so the number of people actually applying to Cambridge is quite low in comparison to Paces like kings where I went to my undergrad so ACL has so many people applying I think it's about 15 or 16 to 1 applicants to place it crazy I want to apply seriously because I think that wants you to go to a place where you decided I'm applying for graduate medicine you've obviously given it quite a little fool it's because you're at a certain point in your life where you know what you want with your life you know that you'll like I want to be at that's what I want to do with my life so you need to then figure out the the way that is going to get you ashore far away until you doing it basically reaching your goals you really wanted to leave it too much up to chance you want to give yourself the best chance possible that sounds like a pretty good strategy was there any other tactics that you used that you can advise people to maybe try out between making sure I'm focused enough on my undergraduate degree to get the grades I want and not putting too much extra Wacom myself but it was so giving myself an even spread of University so not putting all my eggs in one box oneyplays UK top universities only applying to bement University I could have did a bit of both so I think I had Tuk Cat TV mount and then I had Cambridge who at the time when I was applying for project medicine they didn't actually need you to do an entrance exam so I had a good even set the right so I think that brings us together while strategy discussion or any other kind of General helpful tips before we move on to the Q&A the first option is you just apply as a grad to an undergraduate cools and those you'll pretty much starting to get in because you just got such more of an edge over the undergrads that are flying so you're much more likely to gain you making your life so much easier if you do that but the problem with that option if you don't get any funding this counted as a second-degree so if you have the money for it go for it and if you don't mind the extra yeah doing the five yes if I'm absolute bowler I don't need to bother applying for grad medicine I can just apply for undergrad absolutely destroy those 17 year olds are applying Lagos State grades I'm really mature easily Confident by this point Whataburger close to 80th and I'm fine but I'm a 50k for a degree Plus I think you mean has passed three unfashionable funded by GM finance at which is huge so I'm and I'm sure like other universities will to have their own batteries and things as well which you should qualify for especially if you're over twenty-five I think which a little brats all when they're find medicine so that the option you go to be careful when you get to a bit of a gray area because some graduate medicine courses have decided to increase the number of years of that course which historic please before yes to fight yes so when I was applying Imperial had decided that they want to increase the four-year course to five years but that meant that NHS and student finance we're looking at that as a second-degree even though it was still cold I graduate medicine degree they decided that. Didn't qualify for Project funding supposed to keep in mind this whole funding thing because it is a big deal and you don't want to be ending up with a bill for like 15 que no trailer and then I know I'm not doing that because I don't want to be in that much data you're passing he's got an AAS degree Humanity 3 anything other than a bio Sciences degree make sure that you've University accept those degrees I'm similarly if you are science cried it's something to hold onto your head because obviously there then posed to be going to have a quota of Paces at they getting with you no Nann Science degrees so you going to have more competition basically that's only more people playing but let's move on to the Q&A so I asked on Instagram big YouTube channel that people just kind of instantly respond when you asked questions on brother that you have a worse experience in autism because it's very intense very very intense so you'll definitely putting a lot more pressure on yourself to perform in like to get all of that done in a short amount of time where as an undergrad undergrads go off with a 5-week 0632 holidays however long it is what is a Christmas Easter and they have these huge hummus you don't have all that time as a Cambridge graduate medical students you have to in the time that the undergrads running away for the holidays going on like three or four week placement and you have about a week off so the second year of medicine in 2 Fast ESO be more intense and then what about what about from like the social side of things do you suffer because you're like 5 years older than a Corona what to do with writing eyelet what do you think we have the same friendship voice could you give for someone wishing to pursue graduate math with a chemical engineering degree or you know replace that with any known love science degree for the applicants use your degree to your advantage you're going to be quite a unique applicant compared to all the people in turn by medical science so you've got something the definitely play to your strengths and use that difference to your advantage top lies on the transferable skills that you picked up I'm maybe you've done things like internships and things and you'll summon is that have nothing to do with medicine and chemical engineering and that's perfectly fine because you have lent life skills and you know things that you can transfer request medicine okay so it's not necessarily disadvantaged provided you're applying to University that doesn't require less time to degree cuz I suppose if you're applying swings that does require a lot of times it's a green Eco English and you just need to get what's his name HX reasons for post-grad Med Cambridge and how Cambridge that's very vervaeke to get in anything funky Utica Cambridge any reset for Cambridge I had an open application so I didn't know anything about colleges I didn't reset anything about colleges I should have put it down because I had us best base on my application because I got rid of Imperial and I didn't know what to put and my teacher is pressuring me to apply for Cambridge Turtle this is perfect timing says Marcus Roy one applied to Cambridge to GM this year do you have any tips for the health-care / work experience forum where you go to write down like in chronological it's looking like a CV and I treated it like a CV so don't just put down so where it says what experience I should have other things I done as well I did just put to the state and I've been doing teaching and to train and the myths and Sarasota treated me like a TV and trying to fill out face yeah so it's to do with the extra phone that they gave you two feeling off that you've already done you test your personal statement at your previous degree supposed to experience or did you still include education prior to higher education some people that post a statement say well when I was studying a-level chemistry already enjoyed the fact that we do chemical reactions said that you need to have a power off of justifying great choices down what you will either what you've already achieved and you ate apples or what you've been predicted and that's enough that's what I need to know about your academic degree about Reedy what the extra research. not reading my degree but obviously I could do that because I was doing the degree thank you Lewiston or for the question let's move on okay what kind of degrees is suitable for grad medicine I guess we concert. accident Cambridge when you apply and you also have on you graduating senior first-year faithful to say to you historically the people who had known find backgrounds actually be better at medicine they they always come out but I went there it's an result it says to what extent is grad medicine more competitive than applying for medicine near 13th and testificate you don't usually usually but like a group of people who are playing straight from undergrad there was a few people who did Masters and PhD so obviously they do actually have a little bit of a cob of you put the extra qualifications and experience and places like Bora Warrick I think they count they give you an extra point in your application if you've got paged rgcc Craigslist important if you're applying to grad Masters I don't care about your GCSE grades for that point proposed by identity is not going to be that much different from when you're applying as an undergrad so they still look for the same skills and qualities of doctors that you would if you were playing as an undergrad and what I did is I really just soda completely absorbed tomorrow's doctors and good Medical Practice by the NJ because the concept they took part in that are really what they're looking for and what you what you're trying to sell them basically that you either already got the skills they want tomorrow's directions to have or you've been working on developing them and you could knowledge about them and you know that their employees search on what goes into work experience volunteering extracurricular has that kind of thing into ounces I'd especially it was an ethical scenarios when they ask you about you know if patient came in and did this this is what would you as adults how would you react but you won't be using that contacts and your aunt says you can watch my videos Cambridge in the sense that I wasn't informed at all I just put it down on my application and I was very very surprised when I was the first interview that I called and I think they give out that interviews reading as well like November or something so I didn't feel pretty I felt quite scared and worried about it and intimidated as well by Blackfoot at Cambridge and it was a two-hour drive from London to Cambridge and I remember that my mom was so they're getting me to price questions with her and things along the way and then she was like why sound really scared and you can't even speak properly to me and I'm your mom you know how you going to be when you go then she's so psyched me up the entire way to the point where I actually when I got out I was bouncing from stage station and Emily and I had so much energy and she was sort of like you to treat this as a game I'm treated as something fun that you were doing because you know that you know someone who's making up the fact they want flea medicine you actually really do want to do medicine this is genuine and that genuineness and your enthusiasm will come across because it's something you genuinely feel and the other thing that she should have said to me was just feel like you're going in there and you've already got this you got this if you feel like you got this. lacrosse in the way that you speak and act and you know your interactions with people you come across like you meant to already be that and I found that that mine says help me in most interviews I've done and I find that it helps me like positive he's quite easily because if I go in that thinking I've already got this I think it helps you with your Mana straight away I've already bought this and I was meant to be here I meant to have this for life in general it depends on your background so if you done a different degree like if you've not done by scientists agree all you've worked for a while and I doing some people come from consulting or like you do teaching or anything that they've done the different things your background is often quite unique and I think just within my cohort so that's 23 or something of us at Cambridge in my yeah we're also different says that usually going to be something cuz you just got more lifx she probably done stuff to other people haven't see you probably already quite unique to make you application to eat unique I don't really know I mean I guess you could say that to undergrads as well magic that made him quite unique just thinking about that I think you could do anything to make yourself unique questions a few people did ask questions kind of in advance of this like some guys I know this lifetime questions but I totally forgot to screenshot to save it and because I'm such a popular guy these days I just have read messages. So I can't find his attempt questions our apologies to that guy who ever was any final any final remarks a couple of things I wanted to say one it's quite easy to feel intimidated by other garage because if you want someone who's going to be a c like I have and haven't done you no mas icna PhD and you come across people playing and you feel like oh my gosh like faithful sucks so much more you know qualification send me more clarification so much more experience than I do and it's easy to feel quite intimidated by them and get like a sort of imposter syndrome especially when you're at Cambridge don't feel that way because you got to buy you off for a reason and if you do get onto the same course then you'll sort of started was he I think at the interview stage you even killed everyone then it moved it to the interview that counts what happens from there on in in terms of being a university I think you should really relish the fact that you are stupid again cuz a lot of people our age and now you know I don't hang on the grind like they have possibilities and bills to pay exactly where is when students again and opportunity and I think she definitely enjoy yourself and enjoy this time that you've got I will whatever people hearing this cool so I will leave your contact details or we'll leave links to Instagram at least in the description that people can message you in if you want you can reply to them I'm and yeah hopefully people found this useful thank you very much for coming on the show"

            "text": " okay so here's the thing with how to make a Blog there's no definitive guide there's no rulebook there's no blanket statements there's no do these things people make successful Vlogs that everybody loves that are tons of fun that doesn't exist it's only depends on you full years ago when I first started my YouTube channel that was one channel in particular that I took a lot of education and inspiration and entertain well and that was Peter McKinnon I'm so in this video I'm going to Shady nine lessons I've learned from Peter McKinnon and the YouTube channel over the last 4 years let's get into it when I was first starting out my YouTube channel and I was thinking about the idea of blocking my life is an interesting enough like you know I'm a medical student right now and it's a little bit say me and maybe I can make a vlog here and there but why would anyone really care what I'm doing with my life it's not like I'm doing exciting things all the time and I had this phone for quite a while until I saw Peter McKinnon video Courthouse and this is what he said in that video of your personality is more important than doing fun things like jumping out of a plane or doing fun things like ripping a Lamborghini around a racetrack in Monaco those are all awesome things to do and they make great blog content but you take the person out of that situation that is the Wagner you take the vlogger out of those fun scenarios and all you have is just an emotionless commercial that you just flip through on TV giant misconception that I feel is people don't want to start Vlogs they think to themselves I don't have an interesting enough life to Vlog I don't do fun things like that I don't travel I live in the middle of no those are all things that do not matter because you are the story that's Point number one you're the story and I'll return to this video many many times ETA because anytime I'm having a bit of like impulses in Forever on YouTube enough to make videos about myself go back to that video and I think you know what you're right you are the story and it kind of makes me more okay with putting myself out there so thank you Peter for that one that's number two is to be your unapologetically itself out whenever I want any Peters videos like one of the things that's pretty obvious this is how much personality and Charisma he exudes in the early days is that he would have his like an intro is like what's up everyone welcome back to another video we're talking about how to make objects look like they're floating you think coffee he would just do City kind of fun things on camera and it was an approach to YouTube that I haven't really seen cuz I've been watching the occasional like Photo videos YouTube channel for a few years of that point but none of them really have liked personality and they were all just like you know playing it straight of the line rather than just being weird and seeing how paid his weirdness was like accepted and loved by the audience made me more okay with being weird on camera until when I started my YouTube channel and my first video that was very stilted and very formal and thinking that I had to give a presentation that overtime as I got more comfortable with that I started being more okay with Adam camera I found the anytime I would present or exaggerated one of my own personality quirks the audience like you guys would pick up on that end. I think was part of what made this channel go well in the early days and hopefully will continue to make it and go the other thing as well it's not seeing pit of Hell and a demon of Charisma he exuded on camera made me kind of internally think that I want to be a d Peter McKinnon of medical school that was my thought process I want to get into medical school is that when you first learning a Croft like you cheering for example you actually learn by imitating other people in the first instance and the way I think of it is that like my failure to become like pee be like Peter McKinnon is what made me evolve into the kind of personality like camera personality that I now have it's like my way of trying to be the Peter McKinnon medical school which is what the game was four years ago making your life the store you got to share the things that you love because those become integral parts to the story that you were telling through your Vlog I'm just trying to get you guys over that hump that a lot of people don't even begin to Vlog because of that barrier of I don't have an interest but you do your the story share what you love and that was another exempt from his head of Love video but that's another thing that I really taken away from Peter notice from that video but his channel as a whole is that he's very open with sharing the things that he loves weather tattoos recently or like what is pocket so what song is what they are like what is Hawaii the same technique to use is a walk-off he like it's like you can really tell that he is sharing the stuff that he loves and that like love comes across on camera and so this is something I've been trying to do with myself as well over the last 4 years just to kind of unapologetically share the things that I love whether it's my love of my love of listening to things that double speed regardless of what people say or like this is the funky keyboard I like using this is the stuff that I personally love and so I try my best to share it on the channel and these days when I coach other YouTubers in my pots on YouTuber Academy that's a thing that we always try and and help them to remember is that the point of making YouTube videos 11 to listen to before that you don't have to be with other people are telling you to be you can be who you want and like with me when I kind of started YouTube I was very much a kind of medical school lesson best YouTuber where it's basically the question to be getting more how do I get into med school and you know how does how does this work in med school in the nuts. And overtime I sort of felt felt confined in this box of being I don't know productivity or like effective studying type person and if I'd make a vlog that I wasn't about my life or video about something else I will get comments being like okay this is cool but with the study stuff I want more study related content you know what if the only thing people falling National Forest Vista became content and I made this puppy making the contact for two years and I've got like two five-hour long classes on skillshare where I explain study techniques in-depth what would people want what is the only continent allowed to make for now and forever is like study team contact but then around 18 months ago wallets lot of people might say like dude you talking about EDC stuff alive talking about what's in your pockets and pocket knives and wallets like where the tutorials go man like what's up I thought this was a photo Channel it's still as there's hundreds of photo tutorials that you can go back and look through and it's my roots and I'm never going to stop doing that but I think not to clear things up it just I don't know maybe you can give permission to other people that are going through the same thing whatever you want this is the Peter McKinnon Channel sometimes you're going to find stuff about wallets you're going to find a tutorial on how to make a coffee it's going to be real and how to do a cinemagraph it's going to be a vlog with K-Ci Vlog with Maddie holiday snowboarding jet ski walking my dogs cleaning my garage it's just going to be a myriad of things that are me because this is my town this is what I do here and I don't think you should ever put a limit creativity I don't think you should ever just set parameter set rules saying I can only make this I've I've tried to live by that my entire life and I can rub her first watching this video where where Peter said all that stuff and I was like oh my God he's like the things that I've been feeling with my own channel and it away. Video really gave me permission to be okay with exploring other things on the channel that aren't necessarily related to productivity and that video made me more okay with just doing doing videos where to sit down and talk my feelings videos some people don't but that's fine the point is if my time all I could do what I want and I'm going to make the stuff that I like so thanks for giving me permission to do that sound camera type stuff I basically learned from Peter McKinnon and other videos that I sold suggested videos from his head when I first got started absolutely no idea where the lighting in particular but it's his like terrible lighting setup into like something that looked pretty good for less than $50 and that told me so much about the principles of lighting and then I applied that to my channel moving forward 4 less than fifty bucks my entire YouTube filming setup is well-liked with a slide the camera the microphone everything is all kind of based on his videos where he told about his YouTube filming setup as one of those weird things whereby you know just as a Creator like just like documenting the thing that he was doing I like millions of people have not seen those videos and we will based all YouTube setups off of what he was doing and now I see other other YouTubers especially like medical YouTubers who seem to be around it's kind of nice. DeSoto cycle continues and you know you learn from people then you do the thing and then other people died from you and I just feel very nice and wholesome around 6 is in terms of Aesthetics now two years ago he did a collaboration with Becky and Chris which boss became one of my favorite YouTube channels and their branding and Aesthetics is just absolutely amazing they're really great Channel. Chris election Interventional radiologist like a real life doctor who works at the doctor every everything about their videos is so professionally done and the interior design is amazing in the lighting of the the design it should so cool aesthetic design inspiration for being like the gold standard of production value at least in my eyes around about a year ago when when Peter dropped his $500 camera bag like he released his camera bag and Fabrication with no message I think I need to be back to on Kickstarter I just dropped like $700 on it and it was a really weird feeling because in a way I felt I felt grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to support him by buying something from him had that feeling with anyone before where you know I just have so much Goodwill and love towards Appraiser for helping me out so much that when they release the product in like oh my God you're doing me a favor by letting me buy this from you and under my bed and I'm really glad that I have a special program S&D filters as well which again I rarely use cuz I rarely go out it's nice to be able to support think about that feeling whenever I worry about selling stuff like if I'm selling a course opening account and still share I wonder that you know what if I will people think I'm a sellout for like a charging money for something that I think back to how I felt when Peter McKinnon something I'm sure maybe some people will think you to set up doing it but I didn't enough the power building aliens that no like in Frosty is that good stuff takes a lot of effort Graham videos where he talks about kind of how he shoots and edits things to Instagram I'm always completely amazed as to just the amount of effort that goes into all of these individual photos where he'll spend like half an hour shooting hundreds of shots for a single flat Instagram editing it for another half an hour to make it a perfect adding an element's and I think when you scrolling through so nice to me when I'm scrolling through a photographer's Instagram account appreciate the amount of effort well that's great. I'm seeing the behind the scenes of the amount of effort that went into it made me appreciate that every good thing in life takes a lot of effort and so rather than trying to find shortcuts on hey how can I streamline my YouTube production process so much that as tempted as I am to go down that route instead I think about that and think okay how can I put even more effort into my videos to make them as good as they can possibly be if we had to make a fourth Point overall I would say a good time right sharing should be fun sharing the skills you have to help other people sharing your own passions sharing the relationships that you have in your life and comedy and humor and sad moments in fun moments and taking people on a ride just like Eeyore TV show it should be fun should be fun to make should be fun to shoot it should be fun to share and if any of those things are not happening something is not working and you need to correct it so with the image that I have among some people of being some kind of how is a productive and the real answer that question isn't that I enjoy what I'm doing for the most part I like I try my very best to enjoy the journey in anything that I'm doing whether it's studying for an exam or going to med school working as a dog for putting in a candle making YouTube videos of Jamie website I try my best to enjoy the journey I think this is a really really important point because for me I've occasionally have moments where I forgotten to enjoy the journey this is supposed to be fun writing my book for example these days like you know how to pair it if you a few weeks ago or I'd forgotten that it was supposed to be fun and so I let all the stress and anxiety and pressure around expectations and outcomes little buildup in my head enjoy the process and then when my house might remind me that you know you're supposed to be having fun doing this that was when I was like that anytime I'm I feel like I'm not enjoying something or I feel like something feels like a chore or that I put this gold and f****** to reach if I remind myself that you're just remember to have fun remember that this is supposed to be fun remember the end of reason I'm doing this is because fun remember to enjoy the journey and the cool thing is that I'm having fun doing something actually it was more productive buddy. Yeah thanks for this supposed to be fun and if it becomes no fun very long and you know that something is wrong thinking of starting I'll be trying to do check out this video over here which is my 10 top tips for aspiring YouTubers against pizza for being an ongoing inspiration for soul and thank you guys for watching I'll see you next time"

            "text": " friends welcome back to the channel happy new year old that good stuff you need hit my name is a Lamborghini jumps between Cambridge and in this video I want to talk about 15 life lessons that I learned in 2019 all of these are things that I've mentioned in some capacity or another in my weekly email pretty much anytime I come across any interesting life lessons I find useful I share them in my email newsletter every Sunday so you can sign up for the link down below but yeah here is a Roundup a 15 of my favorite ones from 2019 let's go Twilight and I came across this in a book called make time by John zarosky and Jake and they suggest that everyday like the way to be productive is to have a single daily highlight that you're going to be working on for that day so that either something is going to bring you the most Joy something at the most or something that will bring you the most satisfaction option for the last few months and I find that on the days where I remember to set myself a daily highlight I inevitably get more done that day just because I've been people activity that I know I'm going to be doing so that was a very important lesson. Secondly we have a quote from Kurt Vonnegut who the famous writer and he says and I urge you to please notice when you are happy and explain Boomer think at some point if this isn't nice what is and I first came across this kind of towards the end of 2019 and her own reflection I realized that I'm I'm very quick at moving from one thing to another thing to another thing and I very rarely take the time to appreciate and enjoy the moment I came across this quote already started actively do that more like you know let's say I'm driving in the car and I got like a latte my hand I'm missing something a little whatever then you know if this isn't nice I don't know what is you know what it's like to think if this isn't nice I don't know what is and I just thought stufful encouragement for me to be more grateful for the things in my life so of window openers door knockers it's not quite the terminology they use in an episode of the my first million podcast that I first heard the song but I kind of synthesized where they were talking about and turn into window openers and door knockers and the people there are the window and the door knockers the window need to look through a window and when they see their expected outcome on the other side then they open that window and they walk through the door knockers are the sorts of people that will knock on lots of doors and open those doors and see what's on the other side so like the key difference between those is I don't know cuz you don't know what's what the outcome of Your Action is going to be you have to knock on the door and see what is for the window up and see the outcome of the other side and you just kind of work through it to get it and the point they were making this podcast that really resonates with me was that in most things these days a lot of the success disproportionately comes from from the door knocker attitude rather than the window opener attitude there are still some traditional careers like medicine and stuff whereby you know you have your power charted out in front of you and any action predictably but in all the rest of bits of life and you know a lot of business a lot of creation or lightness starting YouTube channel you don't know what the outcome is going to be you just knock on the door you apply consistency and hard work dedication good stuff and you didn't gain the opportunity for Serendipity that you never cost me two and a half years ago what's the point of starting a YouTube channel I would have been able to I'll take it out I would have been like if I'd been a window opener if I just been thinking oh you know let me spokes on my medical career because that's the thing that I can see in front of me phone number for is idea by Derek sivers which is that what is obvious to you might be amazing to others out whenever we're in any sort of like ideas kind of field consecration to sort of stuff making videos of writing blog post writing books reporting podcast and stuff we have this thing like we will have this thing that do you know I'm not going to share this idea because it's just kind of hope he is surely know about it you know that this Listen to I said about the daily High Tides at this point because I've I've incorporated into my life it's pretty obvious to me that you know if you want to be more productive you should save yourself a task to do each day and if you don't then but that idea when someone comes across it who haven't heard it before it's pretty revolutionary looks like some of you watching this video when I talked about you know if this is nice I don't know what else you might have been thinking of going to make that'll be as everyone knows. But when I first read it I was like oh my God this is actually changed encourage me to have to feel gratitude so the point that do Tibbetts makes in his blog post again in the video description is that don't worry the WhatsApp used to use going to be obvious to others because they probably won't be we discover the things that we've learned that 15 life lessons that we left in 2019 because what's obvious to us might not be obvious to others it might even be amazing to others already began to appreciate the the value of lifelong learning so I recently became a supervisor at Goshen College Cambridge University where I teach 10 medical students every week about human physiology and that's meant that I've actually have to learn all this stuff all over again and kind of explore and more detail and that I should be refunded in one of the most joyful activities in my life with the books and put PDFs on papers and stuff and trying to figure out what the best way to teach the soda topic is actually of the UK government I found a commission dislike study which was an analysis of all of the benefit of lifelong adult learning people who learn stuff actively in their in their adult life and the rules for the benefits of adult learning can indirectly improve well-being and be positive outcomes in Health and Social a positive attitudes and behaviors amongst other stuff at one of the way that I've been trying to do this bloodletting thing is by doing online courses on brilliant.org and Brilliant it amazing learning platform targeted in math science and computer science and then go online classes from also the things within those categories like probability number Theory algorithms structures AI neural networks oldest stuff I personally enjoyed taking the computer science courses now I have to consider the plan for computer science involve the medicine but I sort of reason. The time when I was 16. It would kind of be cool to be a doctor who knows how to code rather than to just be a but that meant that all the coating that I've done has been for a very hot pot have never quite taken the time to understand the fundamentals of algorithms the fundamentals of how computer science work and that's what I've been doing on bring it would have been very helping on that front they've also got this really cool and you like daily challenges feature on brilliant my every day there's a new day challenge and that introduces some Concepts to you whether it's my son's computer science and then it gives you a problem in which you have to take that concept a little bit further and try to apply your new learning to it and it'll give you the solution kind of explain it and it's a really good way of just generally exercising the mind and I find that it's also a good model for me to build my own teaching sessions around because the idea of tutorials and supervision that universities like Oxford and Cambridge is that you would give the student a small amount of information you couldn't give them the basic building block and then you lost him a question about it that kind of tests are a little bit more and so kind of takes a little bit further and then we'll see and then you see how far they can go in and out some more knowledge and it becomes the process whereby hopefully kind of lunch together and standing rather than by just kind of regurgitating something out then like I'm car detailing in this video so that's one of the great things about the daily challenges featuring brilliant so if any of this sounds up you'll Street and you want to join this journey of lifelong learning to improve your physical mental social and economic well-being and please it for free at bringing. Org/and the first 200 people to use that link will get 20% off an annual premium subscription and it's totally worth the price of a flywheel Jim Carlson interview on the Tim Ferriss show I think in engineering terms of plywood it's like a device that stores mechanical rotational energy but in terms of like business and creation on YouTube and Entrepreneurship and all the stuff that I'm interested in outside of Medicine the other flywheel is that it's it's something that takes ages to get going but when it gets going then it kind of Builds on itself and its Unstoppable and people often use the flywheel analogy to describe how Amazon works so forgot like they get really low Pro and that leads to people wanting to buy stuff from Amazon which leads to sellers wanting to go on Amazon which means that I'm assuming then has the supply-demand thing which means they can drive prices lower end over all this like one thing leads to another leads to another weather on this flywheel. You know it takes a little effort to get going I'm has been going for years now but then it becomes completely Unstoppable because each thing could have Builds on itself and the way that I've applied this flywheel comes up to my life and I started thinking about it is in terms of things like YouTube look like at the start when you starting a YouTube channel like you know you get basically no one of you and your videos you might get one extra subscriber a day and you feel like super proud of how my God I'm going from 47 to 48 in two days. Incredible videos but the mall kind of produce hopefully valuable content consistently over a long. Of time the motor flywheel gathers momentum by the way things about YouTube and the cool thing about YouTube is that the algorithm is very fly we need and that the movie there's a YouTuber creates the more opportunities all the people to discover that content the more that I could subscribe, what time they going to give the more the algorithm benefits you and does recommending McStuffin suggested videos and drive this will keep them going and going and going but the point is that takes so much effort to get started in today I'm I'm sitting in that mode where I'm thinking of this is too much effort I think know it's flywheel if I'm doing something new that I know it's going to take the effort to get started to begin with 107 is boring fundamentals and I got this blog post by God called James Stewart entitled monster boring fundamentals boring it's fun I don't want to read a few things from it the first day he says for any Endeavor there are a set of basic skills needed to build a strong Foundation these all the boring fundamentals sleeping 8 hours a night exercising consistently meditating reading books writing for yourself and for your peers and then there are domain specific fundamentals like drilling guitar chords or Calculus if you're in the mouth he says that even when we know they're good for us even when we know the bill Advance our goals we avoid taking the steps needed we do the boring fundamentals because well boring repetitive actions done day off today on know the recipe for excitement that the disconnect between the future positive result and the presents log progress off and plateaus and only arrives in unpredictable bus flywheel and that we have to do these boring fundamentals any kind of making a broader point about life in escaping an hours a day exercising eating vegetables and fundamental. has consistently because I always feel like there's something better I could be doing and the reason for that is because it's boring it's fundamental and the rewards don't come immediately where do I think I could go home and film a video that results in a video and that's like immediate gratification or do I want to go to the gym for 2 hours or do I want to actively go to the shops and cook some vegetables to just improve my life in general. That's an obvious obvious benefit and so reading this kind of reminds me that I need to master the boring condiment and this is something that I've tried to actually think about more that's encouraged me to go to gym a bit more and to eat a little bit more healthily Integrity take care of my sleep phone number a is another idea that I found from James tourist blog and that's the idea of type 1 vs Type 2 fun when we think of fun we often think that this is DeeDee Hedonism does the pure unadulterated Joy type of fun 200 playing video games is funnel playing sports is fun but for something like you know running a marathon of climbing a mountain or doing cross country skiing we probably would consider that because it's not the same sort of fun but in this block party talked about this kind of long-distance care coat impact who defined a type 2 fun which is where it's suffering in the present but then it is sort of fun in hindsight another different so fun and sort of the sort of fun that I noticed that being a doctor when it's really really busy is like like it feels very grueling when you were there but then at the end of the day look back anything good day it's definitely not. struggling to keep up with but it is definitely fun and it said type 2 kind of fun and so just understanding it like recognizing this distinction between type one and type two fun of me because now I have the vocabulary in my head to think about the soda that is your takes some suffering like I now appreciate why some people say that running is fun because previous days to think how can running be fun because it's not as fun as playing squash different song Sophie blackall I think, I think maybe her a book called Loom maybe that's it will think it over there if that's the case and I'll blow this guy selfies is a few different modes of writing and the first one is FBR which stands for Faust bad wrong and he says that when you doing the first drop just think to yourself this is going to be frost is going to be bad and it's going to be wrong just having that mindset encourages us a lot more to have to just put stuff down and paper and throw me every time I'm writing my week I initially have that kind of writer's block but I'm like a I don't know what the right cuz then it is going to be good but then after the last few months since I first came across this I've been active in writing down FBR on top of the page just to remind myself okay this is just stop in before going to be bad is going to be wrong and that means that I can just cut it right without worrying without doubting myself without without boring about the quality inevitably at the end of something and then I come back to editing I think I'll actually kind of reasonable or if it's not then I edited but it's a lot easier to edit got a fault that wrong thing then that thing that we as righteous are as great as always trying to and try and get it right on the first drop just appreciating this and having this kind of a Cavalry to Define. Wrong has been really helpful for me in my writing career and again but I got a struggle with the switching of like when I get home from work at 9 p.m. I would think you know I should I should probably feel the video even if I'm really not feeling up to it even if I'm feeling really tired I know I'm going to do great work video that's fine like you know consistency is important and all that stuff but there are a lot of days whereby I kind of procrastinate from filling the video like at 9 p.m. off to work I just have a lot on my sofa to scrolling through Instagram I would get a book and read it recently I won't stop playing on my Nintendo switch because I would be feeling guilty about not making the YouTube video not doing the work and so the idea behind the right of principal at that sometimes it's okay to just write the whole day off and once we're in the whole day off you. you know what I'm going to give myself a break today which means that at least may I found this helpful because then I don't have to feel guilty about not doing anything I know it's like a few weeks ago I was doing this I was sitting on the sofa and my housemate Molly was sitting next to me just like my money I need to come a video but I caught me off and she was like something by the right of principal why don't you just make it right all day and I was like oh my God that you're right and then it just like brought so much joy to my life that I didn't have to put a video that evening so I just kind of dropped my phone find my Nintendo switch and play The Witcher 3 for like 2 hours but it was too glorious hours and I wouldn't have had that enjoy what kind of written day off so you can read more about it 11 long as you still here I apologize for being so rumbly Ultron speed up phone number 11 is the mundanity of excellence and this comes with paper that I read in the 1970s where the author talks about what defines excellence and he studies the field of swimmers so he looks at competitive swimmers in like the local Club National and Olympic levels and try to figure out what's the difference between them quantitative difference it's not it's not really that Michael Phelps practices that much more than someone who is a club or county-level player it's that the people who are at the Reedy Pro end of the excellent spec Spectrum you think it's qualitatively differently and the point he makes it that it's all just very mundane like they actually put a bit of effort into figuring out the technique they wake up on time every day and do it look after that diet is nothing really sexy about the way that these people get really good stuff it's just do the mundane repeatedly and just kind of do it consistently paper by the whole thing cuz he was a riveting read made me realize that we're always on the lookout for some kind of shortcut you know iPhone to this myself I'm guilty of this year but like really but I just probably isn't going to make much difference to your life what will make a difference to your life is just doing the boring fundamentals repeatedly and the point that this guy makes the papers that Excellence is ultimately a Monday there's nothing sexier exciting about it it's ordinary Monday and like it's all just you know doing the right things consistently and try to get a little bit better each time I thought was very interesting read work-in-process several years ago but I still have ingrained into my my life but it really stood out to me when I was in Sudan this time last year when you go to new place like you probably know this with that kind of meeting new people and getting to break the ice and why reading this book what's from everyone is friendly but you have to be willing to go first because if you go first if you take the initiative to say hello and freezes elephant stop like a conversation you will find that people just generally nice and everyone's really friendly and so in Sudan you know for a few minutes I was like weather in Spanish IROC require a drain know what to do but then I start actively going up to people and kind of saying alone just generally having a chat this going first to identify pot the really really good experience I think my experience in Sedona would have been a lot less fun had I not gone first with those things and I think this applies generally across-the-board as well like you know when I'm at work I trying to refer to introduce myself initiating transfer between icon and inviting people to things just having like being able to take that fear of embarrassment and internalized within all cells and forget about it and just go first means that we see this how amazing humanity is the sounds recording how many Humanity how willing people are to connect as long as we go first 13 high-leverage housekeeping the Sonata. My brother came up with and which is that every Saturday what he does is that instead of doing active work on his his thing he does wake hold high-leverage housekeeping which is that sorting out the email inbox sorting out the to do list in a cleaning the desk sorting out like you know the project management software I think uses notion to mention trazodone startup and figuring out what needs to be done when is spending a few hours on a Saturday to get your life in order sort of like Amazon used to doing like that it was one year just before they had a billion in Revenue where the mentor for the whole year was go high OG Ohio getting our house in order and the point of the whole year with their kind of phone Play Systems and make everything work pretty well not try and create new things and so watch what I do know is that every now and then I think about having a whole day dedicated to high-leverage housekeeping where I can do things like my decisions where I will at but I won't be doing the next week so the next month or so actively planning new video ideas where is otherwise I'm just in kind of technician modem just kind of doing the thing I never really take the time to step back and figure out where I can apply leverage work housekeeping to make things scale better run better be more fun that's what I stopped keeping a link to all of these in my email newsletter if you want to have it read in more detail one of the Fourteen is idea of having an inbox for your brain and this is from David Ellensburg things done the art of stress-free productivity I was just kind of like the Bible for productivity about how to get stuff done but the main thing I take away from this is that it's very important to have an inbox for your brain basically a place where you can capture ideas and things like as soon as they hit you so that you can upload them from your brain into this inbox so these days I use the app drops for that so anytime I have an idea for a video or anything I'm thinking of either or my Apple watch or my phone or on my Mac I will open up the draft app right right and that means that when I'm doing my Holabird housekeeping in my weekly reviews or whatever that I can convert the draft items either into notion projects or into a to-do list items if they need to be done I just lay or I can just going to follow them away my archived it's nice having his inbox my it means that my brain has been for having ideas not for storing them and that's the idea that David Allen talks about in his book getting things done again Link in the description the time any idea that you should have a list of all of the projects that you are currently working on and that you want to be working on it like after reading this and in the afternoon I made like a project list of all the videos that I do the video ideas I might have an older video throws currently working on old laptop written down meant that my brain was doing this like a background processing of these various project as it was going about my day and just like not even realizing it or even maybe when I was asleep so I sometimes I wake up in the morning and I'll be like that idea of video. I had ages ago that I wrote down in this product list I've just thought about something to make that happened or if I'm driving to work in the car and listening to an audiobook listen to podcast the case where does have not had that references something for some of the projects or go on my list and I didn't really have that. so I'm a real big believer of having a list of products are working on and that's not even in the video front assist in life in general and the way the David Allen to find that is as is that a project is anything that has more than one step required to do it so now I've got like a whole disappointed going on and I find that's really helpful and that's been the finalists in The Island in 2019 so that was a couple of things that I've done in my own team in fact it wasn't like 15 pretty much older than Lincoln the bigger description you can have a look at my weekly email newsletter And subscribe if you like but that is where I share all of the things in real time as I discovered them but I thought I do this annual Roundup as good a few weeks ago I was making my annual review video and I thought 15 things. not this year why don't I just make it to video so that would kind of wedding idea came from yeah life lessons life and stuff if you'd like this whole life window for that already have supposed to see you in the next video"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel and to the fourth and final video of this special medical Monday Series where were talking about how to prepare for the AFP the academic Foundation programme as I said in the other free videos this is very exclusively aimed at 5th and 60 medical students if your 5060 medical student applying to the AFP you probably won't gain much educational value from it but you might find it entertaining if you'd like watching my videos anyway I really appreciate it if that's the case how to prepare for the personal interview which a lot of places to have in a when you're applying to the AFP real to share some results of that we found helpful on how to prepare for the AFP everything to be Link in the description blood I think about this and I hope you find it useful in London and the button it's like a gate for a flight as well to have a person to be whatever else you stuff about your life and things but you got any tips for that from your experience a lot of people are shy about nervous when you're off to sell yourself again in the middle of getting comfortable talking about Paws experiences what achievements you have and weedy trying to and make someone believe that you that you really want this job and that you're you are right candidate for it so say one thing you can do is make a list of pasta if you've done that's something I recommend to will medical students actually collecting in one place which will make it really easy when you come to Applications such as cool medical or surgical training or specialist training collecting simple things and it slowly cries over the years and you know when you come to go surgical training you already got a lot of stuff that already wears a lot of other people who haven't done that serve Chasing Cars old certificates for 4 years ago and it's tough something that Canadians came up with describes a six domains that make up the medical experts okay and it has things like collaborators leadership professionalism and you can stop to list things that you've done that fulfill each of those domains and you can follow you break down your achievements and then you have those like something's on your TV place for being modest with your achievements when it comes to I know a couple of people who you can give them a little thing that they will allow braids on make it sound absolutely amazing I'm so so now you've got to be comfortable telling the examiner that you've done impressive stuff hopefully you got the content and it'll be happy to share and talk about old impressive stuff you've done in the past second was with someone who was doing an update on both of them said that I should have been more kind of elaborative of my various treatments the last five years that's done thousand Revenue in like toy a few friends who didn't get into particular AFP is one thing that we did wrong I think with that we assume that our interviews had read all white face questions and I think that was a big mistake for dumpling TBH Satan was I actually did not mention the fact that I have this indication I have a YouTube channel or any of the stuff because I had written in my what's the most liked obscure random things to talk about you had done a PhD like she's a proper medical school training that was a question and she said she didn't mention so don't assume anything they're all set and regions again Oxford or bit more personal said they would have read your white space Madonna stop thinking about if you if you really want to do this as a said if if you're interested we will not just people who are set on doing the FP but actually also people who may not be aware of the integrated program in the UK and he want to see whether this is something that they would be interested in we will take you through all the steps and they'll be I'll be quite an intensive to de-program willingly some lunch and things are lying. will cover everything and stop reading also that you kept for your website I to see whether there been any changes so for example as I mentioned last year London scrapped that white space questions so they may be further changes this year so I keep a lookout on the websites and speak to people who are currently or have done the FP speak to them about their experiences about potential regions and supervisors Etc sold useful information and the more you do now and the best role will be useful and we'll link stuff about the course here and here and there and in the description below you can check it out if you feel like it but you know yeah how to prepare for the AFP miniseries if that's even on the internet about preparing for the AFP it's whole kind of hidden behind courses and books and stuff so hopefully this four-part Series has been obvious to you and you had a helpful if you have to give the video a thumbs up how you go on it with your aft I didn't get in myself I'm kind of glad I didn't get in because thank you very much if you haven't subscribed and I will see you in the next week"

By talking about five questions that you should ask yourself if you think flights Cambridge Ave Cambridge and whether that should stop you from applying will start off with Kellen Paul Jake Marcus and shouldn't talking about these five questions that you should ask yourself to workout weather Cambridge is going to be for you I'll see you in just so the kind of person that finds the lack of Science of medicine as well as the people bathe medicine particularly interesting will do well here we the people bathe medicine everybody scope to learn but if you are academically interested in medicine Percy then this is good course for you from first principles and and Cambridge beaches in that way if you are somebody who likewise like to learn things conceptually likes to go to my understanding rather than rote memorization then you should definitely plan to Cambridge and you're happy. It could well be ca Ephesians with you do for people and sometimes they can be quite intense co-signing it's mold outside of things that you would have to consider which which you would be suitable for the Cambridge Times are quite intense we have eight weeks of lectures supervisions and you have to Anastasia life and sleep so you have to be able to cope with those intense 8 weeks old push through this and that's what makes it such a good experience I think is it is difficult but you make such good friends because of soda Cambridge medicine now we're going to talk to Molly he's going to be talking about looking days I heard experience with flying would be good enough I thought it was completely different well with people and it was anyone I was. My parents to go to one of the open days. I realize there were people just like me as a friend as well people just like me who would giving people tool to Moody Street and it really came out today that this is the place that you could go as a normal person I needn't have to be complete nut and especially cambridge-isanti colleges and it's really useful to see as many colleges as you can get an idea of what the system is and for me will convince me of my college was actually the admissions to talk so I think attending to looks like that is great see the people who will end up teaching you if you come in about stereotypes stop me from from applying but over the last 5-6 years of helping students with their medicine applications I have heard quite a lot of times that she was a reluctant to apply here or if I talk to it because they are genuinely concerned about the negative stereotype the concerned I can send that going to be really weird and I really know they all these kind of things and the media doesn't really help with this week news articles about Cambridge students burning money in front of homeless people and weird interview questions and an older the stuff kind of like this image that Oxford and Cambridge a places for other people rather than places for normal people like outside I mean if you are concerned about about fitting into Cambridge that I think you might want to watch this next section if you've already decided to apply already doesn't because feel free to feel free to skip ahead but we're going to get today at Marcus children and myself talking about the Cambridge stereotype and about fishing and that general area there are many people that look like me but to me that's more of a motivation I think Cambridge isn't going to change until more about applying more about get here seeing if you feel like you didn't fit the mold realized that is space here for you regardless because anything you have to do is be intelligent enough to go get that so that she didn't ebooks you have to check but you make me feel like you don't fit won't the media tells you if you're intelligent enough just have to pay SSI mobile change me that hit that smokes you at all initiate other than parents can be such as their time is going to be hot really everyone's really down to have everyone has their own thing that they do people do different things walking like the send me things that people get involved with you in Cambridge and that isn't really one thing and if people worry about the thing serve The Stereotype if you if you would just tell me a society it's everywhere answer people from everywhere answers come here and you'll find someone's friend ultimately despite my trying to convince them because they've decided of Cambridge isn't for me another type of person to Cambridge and what I say to that is that gets you all the type of person to Cambridge if you don't fit the mold of your private school white male even if you don't if you don't exactly the type of person you should be fine to Cambridge because how else will Cambridge is diversity in crazy how well with everyone unless people like you apply and actually there are there are loads of YouTube around hips move particularly doing a really good job of trying to smash the Cambridge stereotype of the White Oak ostrich male student so I mean if you're in need of inspiration of the banks in the in the description you've done a great job medication to pop middle of doing a great job of trying to show that phone Cambridge is not this this that it's it's not just as negative stereotype it's a wonderful place and we need wonderful people like you to play all right tell if you're unsure of whether you should apply to Cambridge and then we talked a little bit about open days on about 15 and about the whole stereotype situation I mean hear the vast majority of my friends and Friends quite like it there as well I say that if you're thinking of applying to Cambridge the only thing that should help you decide one way or another is whether you think the course is going to be right for you if you're the kind of person that enjoys the academic side of things that they will cope well with the intense times then yeah. like images fantastic by posting you had a wonderful time of the last six years and I mean this is our final year I know stupid speaking to love my friends and everybody starts believing of imagine having gone anywhere else anywhere else medicine down to you I just hope that after watching this video hopefully if if even a handful of people decide to actually apply to Cambridge rather than thinking that it is not for that fit in then that would be a very positive outcome but thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give a thumbs up if you haven't subscribe to the Channel please I'll see you next time bye"

screen larger and get tips for using Windows smart we need to fix your Microsoft account so first thing I got one of them into Windows as an error message about my account what does beautiful adjust the fact that some things but it feels very much like a Windows trackpad rather than a Mac / iPad Pro trackpad keyboard is like the fact that is amazing this is the single best product I've used in a very very long time is a fantastic may become so used to those that this feels just like you wrong anyway that is fine but feels feels pretty good let's do typing tests Bing default search engine love it doesn't screen recording through the Xbox app Windows of The Darkside you just don't expect to see our messages like typing test typing test number one on the Microsoft has been quite sluggish going to be in front of to happen for the Pentium model rather than the fancy new Intel processor because those ones 344 I guess that's to be expected because of the size of the thing but I should quite like the keyboard this whole set of fabric that's what about the device in general now so I feel like carrying this around if they're magnetic thing for the apple pencil comparing it to Mike 12.9 inch iPad Pro without the keyboard like this feels like carrying around like a hefty kind of laptop type device thing where this feels really nice Aquarium craft kickstand to my wife doing this station on this 10.5 in screen so it's so similar to iPad model conversion rather than be new Intel M4 whatever it's called version even just immediately on setting this up for the first time you'd expect a device to become a blazing fall the first time but I'm already getting a little bit best rated by the speed limitations of this like I want to be able to do stuff a lot faster than I'm able to because it just seems to be working very musket there's a slight amount of infant might as well now he's stereo installation on Windows 10 in S Mode runs fine so can I download from the App Store Microsoft Store switch out of S Mode perfect thank you for that price for the next two weeks at least and we'll see how it goes I might even take it to work time instead you doing having a stolen during action and Dokken happening on the screen where is it this year I just feels less precise than the MacBooks in your backpack write a note Notepad generic Notes app yes I can write on my goodness cuz if you're hovering it's like the coast was moving around and then when you press then it should have records stuff haptic feedback as a writing compared to the apple pencil with the iPad because that the richest Artist as precise similar to goodnotes on the iPad Pro which is why I don't like goodnotes is that when you went when you make a stroke it slightly adjust what you actually did spoke lies to make it look smoother look more legit I don't want the app to try and make my handwriting is fine but I'm just not Institute of North using notion I get like maybe that's a bit slow but it's like when I scroll it doesn't it doesn't feel like my fingers are in charge of the scroll again comparing to Max like I feel as if that does basically no lag between doing the thing on the thing on the screen refresh rate like you feel like you are in control of the thing whereas yeah with this I'm scrolling but it's different life there's a slight input lag between between moving the fact pattern actually it's a little bit better on Microsoft Edge but it doesn't feel as seamless as it does when you're pregnant by using a phone or using my phone or not throwing up found the most story waking moment of my day sometimes it take my iPod into bed with me for that but I'll try for the next couple weeks to do it on here cuz that'll give me an idea monkey butt thing like a vote First Impressions review but saying it's very slow as well a little bit slow and this doesn't even come with a keyboard it doesn't just like it's like you're playing in exactly the same price ballpark at the budget iPad but having played that is so much faster than this I think Apple stuffing generally spawn better optimized in terms of speed and people say the oh yeah well has been a little bit on the largest lobster side even though the cable is very nice and it's very cute form factor if this could be I'm doing it I will try and use it the next two or three weeks and I'll report back thanks

Whittaker at Palm and we tap twice when it was time to have a break and then we talked three times when the break was over so we had this kind of thing a problem with you in the library but call the Pomodoro society and that has been going strong for the last like 5 years because who calls me everyday helps a whole heap of notes to get through instead of just saying oh I'll go with whatever pace and see what I get through when I get through it so it yourself little minigols you know by the end of town to get this done cuz if it's a big all broken up into little chunks of slow medium how many hours per day minimum should you do in a gumto quantity of time with you spending the work I think I find really useful asset I set myself a timetable and set myself go so you stay so so long as I know that I have to go for that day then that's being a good day so you know $5 of really bashing at it maybe more maybe less or depends different grades from their exam everyone has different marks that coursework which means they need better McNair. we going for that first about top of the Euro whatever or you really really want to smash it and 11 p.m. go home safe I think I can go say that you don't want to buy yourself out I find out if I have two days which I work for a long. Of time than yesterday I'll just be completely mind-wandering time-wasting Anatomy writer so peso how many hours should you do 10 hours one day and then nothing for 2 days you think well and you keeping on top of it don't worry too much do you ever have days where you see the holidays yes today today is basically decided that no matter how late it gets in the day you can still save it so even if 45 minutes so even if you come to the end of the day and you're annoyed at yourself for being unproductive for procrastinating you can still safe today 2 - day and everything but isn't the same person actually decide knows I said Sunday I'm going to take a break do something nice for myself keep my morale up and that way it breaks up the week's not just like this day off today out today slug you can keep it up instructions to the question of how do you motivate yourself to stay consistent one thing that I really like doing is changing of the work environment on someone else about this when we used to live in in camper Town Center at like in the city center I have this thing where they were each day I go to different Library so I kind of went around like 20 different libraries in Cambridge this cuz it's nice to change up your surroundings and sometimes I find that if I'm really bored I would like literally just go to Costa down the road treat myself revision like me then always budget for some days in which you just don't feel like doing anything today I'll use it to how do you organize your time when it comes to studying 25 minutes on 5 minutes off of 45 minutes on 5S off or equivalent used to work for me back when I was like really fixed on essay preparation Adele day it's about taking it goes off not so much how much time and sometimes freezing when you think about it what if you work super hard and don't get the grades one of them should be about what you could possibly hopeful so if you applying right and maximizing the potential one of those should be applying beyond what you ever thought you could be and then one you know what you think you could get one and but having that one that you could never believe you get an itchy that highly gives you something to strive will make sure that you're feeling of potential and if you don't get it that's okay because at least you gave it to go I should be thinking about all I've got to make this over off of the world's going to end this like I miss this offer Edwards will be so disappointed in me to be horrible just focus on the fact that you gave you a very best shot negatively see what I mean by that is look at things that I think you know I have this chance to I think I've got an ace on to a scan off of meat I might not make it you know I'm being negative about it so look at it positively look at it even if you don't get the grades even if you don't make that offer even if you end up going to a in your opinion let's go to university because it was your insurance while the new phone I think it's a comforting thought to know that to be honest most of us a bit location in Psychology we're even in in the presence of major events in our lives most of us just going to revert back to a baseline Double Happiness very very quickly it don't study but it looks like losing Define within like 2 months they'll go back to the base of the penis so you know regardless of how much you, that plays a while to the Cambridge room. Even if you do end up going there you'll still be as happy as if you weren't there about someone things out makeup with out of thinking about stuff in the future I'd like I've never particularly hated any subject to University it's just a step in the ones I've been let's go. Like I was in Middle set for French because the real kind of everything that you work on and if you if you find that you hate him out like hiding my room I tend to break it up and find game if I the talk so instead of having a big massive room to clean all think break up into little sections and sync accounts I've done this section I'll go have a coffee other than this section I'll check Facebook or whatever you know just break it up set logos maybe put a timer on and see how quickly you can do the whole thing whatever it takes 2 game fire and make it more enjoyable put advocate in in terms of religion generally given for stuff that you like if you could have treated as a game on my website bite that friend of a friend of mine's got from a grandma who said that I should not stress about exams instead of the game that you play with yourself question on the motivation stress and the ideas and you can see that from just woken tags and rim that you whenever and smelling around outside and exam room and then you see some people pouring over some people chatting some people hiding away from everyone else because it's you because you know they don't want that stress to assimilate into them myself I like to wake up having coffee and just clever mind of everything and hopefully get to the exact place early maybe I can walk around that reminder and then just go in and sit down and do that time that's why I do what are you doing pretty stressed out if I doing what class minutes outside the example some people they find that comforting you know going over the main bullet points that they made throughout the hot time studying it obviously doesn't necessarily mean a lot goes in but it means assured by looking at the one that don't have time so really it depends completely on you and the sound of it if you are a bit nervous about your exams. Just make sure you have a really chill morning make sure you folks reminding yourself how much work you've done that kind of thing for the for the evening that just took out all demands of the examen outages diffuse distress that was me Paul and Catherine old finally America Emmanuel College Cambridge we were answering various questions you I sent him regarding motivation stress time management. So the stuff in tomorrow I can recall it designed for being a Ricoh but how you learn something the first time she's like that in in in tomorrow City little bit a little bit video about active recall that Taken like three hours to fill in like 8 hours to edit and like little research goes into it but like I do want to maintain this thing but everything but so I thought it would be good to kind of get my friends as well there they've booked on August 8th we're getting a bit of extra perspective please let me know the comments I've got lots of friends around who I'm more than happy to be featured on the YouTube channel and if you have really good advice to give so if you guys don't mind 5 the universe videos where I am kind of giving a real through Full House response to a certain a certain thing thanks very much watching good luck with your vision for tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep now and yeah we'll see you tomorrow is going to be talking about have a good day"

when I negotiate myself out of bed at 8 a.m. and then shower and change and make myself a cheeky espresso which expected tastes awfully Grim why do people drink the stuff voluntarily at price of an iPad in hand I take a seat on the hotel room balcony and do my morning dump on Monday and of course scroll atmosphere through the breakfast buffet restaurant continental breakfast of croissant when Jem smoked salmon and a hand my omelette a chill a breakfast for half an hour and then head into the hotel lobby to have a zoom cool with Angus where I was planning out the final details for a course the part-time YouTuber Academy this is a full week live I'm running for the first time from next week or what I didn't mention it on YouTube but if you're following me on Twitter or my mailing list you would have heard about it and if you want to find out more about the next cohort which is happening in February 20-21 you can join the mailing list with the link down below that stuff on the ocean until 10:45 when I take a quick toilet break followed by a chat with someone from the Apple marketing team which was very exciting indeed we chatted about how the different Apple product fit into my workflow for YouTube medicine and life as a ho hopefully one day they'll start sending review units of that product so I don't have to buy them myself to make videos about them all anyway it was a very pleasant conversation and it's always nice to Fanboy about Apple if the people who actually work that at 12 I had down to the hotel's fancy house poolside to get some more work done I take my iPad NFL pro I listen to my Spotify study with me playlist while doing some more writing and planning and preparation for this upcoming course after solid hour of work and then half an hour of waiting for the Apple Store to load so I can upgrade my phone to the 12th Promax I decide I need a change of scenery I head back to my room to give my invisaligns a cheeky wash and to grab my beach Essentials namely my headphones iPad and son cream of course then I take the hotel's train on Wheels service to head towards the see-through some picturesque views the guy at the beach very Conde disinfectant deckchair and I spend a few seconds the feeling of my feet in the sand that few seconds of enjoying life is more than enough to save my appetite for fun and so I get back to being productive I'm a candelabra show of putting on suncream and then I bust out my MacBook to do some more Coast preparation we working on the knowledge base Boces in Goshen to the most common questions inquiries we're going to get from a 400 students during the course from 2 to 2:30 I do a lot of typing on my MacBook while enjoying the idyllic scenery in front of me and the clouds going by at this point I'm feeling a bit peckish and I've had enough of this so I trained back to the hotel and head towards the poolside again I very briefly dip my toes in the water with you again is all the fun I need in my life for a while before receiving the hustle for the next hour I am once again big surprise continuing the setup for the course by sorting out the zoom things that are students muscally add to the calendar at some point food arrives which is supposed to be a smoked salmon Bagel but ends up being more like sandwich and some of these weird rustic French fries at 4 p.m. my head back to the hotel for a one-hour cool with my business coach why we chat about life and business and stuff even gives me some solid relationship advice prompted by something I tweeted a few days ago by the way friends if you don't follow me on Twitter then please do it because then you can give me relationship advice when I tweet things like this week at 5 p.m. and then I spent 20 minutes watching a YouTube video entitled what happened to sting I used to watch that will pick up a lot back in my troubled youth and so it was interesting to see the history behind the rise and full at 5:20 I decide to stop being a waste man and get back to work uploading a varies brand assets for the coast after while me housekeeping person invites the room and wants to clean up remind me to pay to the hotel lobby after running around a bit with my selfie stick like the Pakistani tourist that I am I realize the incredible power of the selfie stick because everyone dismisses me as a tourist wear it if I did the same thing with my big ass camera people would feel creeped out and the hotel tell me that I'm not allowed to film on site at 6 p.m. I ordered myself a tea latte from the hotel bar and then for an hour I do get more typing away on the iPad these days I'm reading through Ryan holidays book The Perennial set up which I first read in 2018 but which I'm not rereading to mind some more time at 7 p.m. I decide that's enough productivity for one day and it's time to wrap up the first order of business is to head to the gym to get in a quick workout because when I get back to the UK in a few days will the gym will be closed so I need to maximize my games to continue my quest to become a gymshark athlete for an hour or so I hang out at the gym while listening to * sites by Brandon Sanderson on Audible I do a bit of rowing live deadlift and then some #curls for the girls before heading down to the local spa at 8 p.m. I spend the first half an hour continuing to listen to my audiobook and then at 8:30

And we're going to end with subject specific tips for how to write essays for stuff like English and history and secondly how to revise for a level maths questions Automotive property if you have a spare half an hour you can just watch the whole thing cuz it kind of entertaining I think yeah but before you can recall that you have to blend it first actually learning the stuff in the first place oh I don't want to do the practice paper that my teacher is because I don't know it yet you are learning by doing that to be cool so fussy just be really wouldn't give it go and try the price paper even if you feel horrendous the under the bed Fred secondly Gleaner like the cover test so you look at it you read it through you cover it you decide what you just read what you just learned about leaves structures and then see how much I am going to make it about us at some point where I talked about everything to know that stuff but basically what I'm going to say is that I think there's a misunderstanding before I can then revive it and I don't think that's a bad thing about it I think the first thing to think about is that you need to understand it first understanding the most important thing the understanding is what I'll be able to explain this to a friend if you ask yourself that question after reading for a topic actually be able to explain hypothyroidism to a 5 year old Howard Hanna remember in the process of learning the public in prison questions for yourself interview questions for hyperthyroidism might be what are the causes of hypothyroidism struggling to recall it because you've forgotten some of it so I don't think we can quiet-like get learning away from revising because like a chapter 2 of that book called make it stick is is is it entitled to learn retrieve it's all about retrieving retrieving is but learning and without retrieval there is no Learning Without mistakes is there is no doubting that's not think about learning and revisionism separate things because there's one thing reading Dion's and thinking I understand how this this works but a completely different thing having a blunt question in front of you trying to work to reason out so don't be afraid of going and trying to question and crashing and burning and then after looking at because if you don't engage with the question fast we just go straight and try to read the arms and say like you know I know that now and that's just deceiving yourself why you going to go wrong until you just give it a go and scope I can't believe I stumbled on this simple step simplifying the equation really I need to be tightened double-checking everything through to make sure that doesn't happen again. what practical as well in terms of that teaching it tell the people demonstrating that you really understand it yourself obviously we don't have any five-year-olds hung around so what we often tend to do is love each and I privately self-study and then we try and teach it to each other cuz that way you really check for understanding that just made so you know they wouldn't mind if you don't have anything doubt everything down pat but then they can ask you questions and you can go actually this is how it was unfilled South kind of watching through yourself and then you'll understand it better alternative the guy actually I didn't know about myself I'm going to go look up president who run Cardiology Factory recall what the hell do I know about tricuspid regurgitation anyway and then pull to the explained we will have a different areas of expertise and I think kind of working with your friends in this brother than kind of in competition with your friend rather than you are an individual and you're working against you might have competitive I don't want my friends to know I went on your course cuz you know obviously I'm competing against them going to be chomping what like little tiny bugs you getting over full other people compared to the thousands of people take things out anyway so even if you think of it for a purely selfish point of view it's still the wisest thing to do Sidetrack from the original question any last minute tips what would you be doing at this point right do the same thing again if you feel like you're completely overwhelmed and you've just not nearly what you're hurt to buy this point you need to take a step back take stock of what you have take stock the big holes and trying to hold him and try and stick to like a general overview of those topics that you really haven't covered enough don't try and cover them in as much detail as you'd hoped. Just make it through having fun you should really really have a plan and I'm sure you'll make a video on this sometime about what because they look at a topic and they and they think oh my goodness I've got so much to do about this and actually is a really scary thing when you look at all the mountain because you're waiting for you set if I still need to do is to bite that bullet and to write down every single thing that you need to do and then as you write that down you start thinking of maybe I can just maybe if I put this into this week and that thing to the other weekend so my timetable I will get to the end of it and it would have finished them but the worst era to do is to be scared of it and then you decide that okay I'm just going to float through the next month and do about this because you're just being too scared to deal judgment in the room so you need to write it down and then put it into divisible chunks that you think you might be able to handle if it's too much then you know decide to not provide some things really even and then actually you realize you can do it it is actually manageable it's so easy to just keep telling yourself so I'm just going to keep going keep doing the bets to spot things and do them as well keep jumping from subject to subject I'm coming but really doing the hot set at the stop and going okay I'm going to actually sit down look at everything I need to do figure out how I'm going to be sold together not going to be so much more important one thing I would say is one of the most useful things like probably be most useful thing you can do with a given hour or two hours is to sit down and on a single page write down every single topic that is in your syllabus and I would like info CCRI okay I really only got 15 topics that means if I do one day I can do each topic twice before my. that's a good way of kind of thing what do I have left to do and you can check out my magical spreadsheet math method which was reference in a lawsuit if you want more information on this case that is that is that it's what I thought everyone doing as an exam first thing I always do and it will absolutely suck like it just itches so bad sitting there and writing a story how do you learn stuff quickly edible knowledge what's come up and pause papers that kind of thing how do you how do you take an exchange 1 month 2 weeks 1 week before the exam where you often go wrong and it doesn't type of exam question or an assassin public in general Princeton abdominal exam I always forget to go down to the patient levels they don't look as in today thing I know I was forget that so close to the exam I want to be reminded myself with a Coleman stuff I do wrong spy definitely now the day Hot Topic that's how you know that's told me they need to welcome often not the kind of the sinking feeling in your gut pipe topic and so you avoid it because you're scared and cuz you know it can be cracked to do that but you just got to face up and do it so much hassle and I'm done with active recall do you make the questions as you read the book or do you make notes from the textbook first and then read them and then quiz yourself how do you do it Michael is not a specific formula your father and I apologize sincerely for giving me the impression that there is a specific set things like series of things that you need to do to recover just about retrieving stuff from your brain if you enjoy making notes on the textbook fine make your notes and drive to Rico questions on Nurse if you don't like making guys are amazing I love CDP a love letter written guide I use exclusive leaders and make my questions by some that or use their kind of end of chapter questions every doesn't matter as long as you're making your brain work do whatever you feel like you would have worked I didn't she say just you know to count to that little bit you can try and not let yourself shy away from using great resources that already out that kind of take and especially if they're making those notes and basically copying out a note form and not actually doing any active recalls while still making those notes movies and I thought that old amazement online nowadays you should be using those you should be forcing yourself to do that hard active recall stuff sooner rather than later what's the understanding so if you're struggling with it affect making mint committee help question before you look in the box came to do the thing of I'm just going to read through the Mars game oh yeah I would using one spreadsheet for Smokey practice anything in my opinion that reduces friction between what you think you want to do and actually doing it is what's doing buy ice ice Pendleton the friction between kind of me sitting down and make me video is worth a 50-pound expense because Prejudice is so easy to do and he's a bit of effort to set up if you go to set up already. Maybe was really know how to use the feature easier you don't have to do this whole tagging buses what he puts up with v x buses using filtered xcetera which can be a bit mole what do you think these weird things like he like clothes completions in like Imaging room asking people swear by but Google Sheets use paper flashcards or spreadsheet method if you know that that's going to be a way you can organize easily and not have noses flashcards carving stupid little details like Isaac words like making my auntie flashcards and then I realize that I just made so many. I'm asking because the image occlusion thing is just great but then you realize you've ever done it and coverlets and difficult relationship doesn't require every time before you look up the answer every single time for yourself if you think about and then depart the bit to wish you get unstuck trust questions you you will you will get to something you'd be like what is this and then before you look at them so just think about reason for best friend supposed to dredge up that knowledge comes that you know that subconscious bit of your brain and then you'll find that when you active active life active recall to the way of life if you would purchase those mugs for about 7 subjects like history in English but I found it working well for biology but I'm not really sure how to use them fan out of the subjects I love using flashcards to memorize particular paragraphs so are you smart spell extensively for my second and play Lord of the time with any kind of subject that you do any kind of message subject there are certain building blocks that go into lots of different essays that you can probably make a point about how something and Gregory at the star using imagery and how this was relevant to like the Victorian times you can check into it whatever I say you want equally if you drink medicine and talk about the evidence we did some experiments in like the giant squid axon in like 1942 evidence-based the paragraph is in like a citation and then sentence form typography like some company absolutely killer introduction then you kind of prime them to give you these Mark of the end of the essay I was just thinking so in your introduction if you can you can interest you have a small penis and an outline where you're going to go from there they can tell whether you're going to get fast and 212 to genuinely how do you use PayPal to your advantage talked about this before just do the paper like do the one thing that helps is when revising from us what is that they put the questions in a logical structure like can you find the area of a square foot of a rectangle when you find out where is a circle and you kind of do a lot of things and a lot of things like that they've done studies on students problems that you doing that for some reason improve your performance by quite a lot so you know when you revise income ask maybe don't think okay today I'm going to revise coming on the train everything today I'm going to do BS question even if you think you can do it and then focus in on why you didn't do it Solutions are really good for that noticed ounces final exam technique tips to write a really good essay a person is bad handwriting is really really were getting back to improve your handwriting tou wonderful ideas that come out from your head yeah you just really annoyed so so so annoying you want to get someone else to read it and see if they can recognize handwriting when it's not you know you reading urine thing about developing stick okay that was me pull and Catherine answering 10 different questions that you guys had about specific study techniques IB find something useful from that the previous video we were talking about like motivation stress time management see if you're into that sort of thing you can watch that more about lectures and essays and managing the huge amount of work at a guy University video thank you very much if you haven't subscribed"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hear my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge I just had my very first long day shift and this is going to be a video where I just like talk about it and I think this is the sort of video that I would have really appreciate it back when I was eight points medicine and be a medical student cuz I think hopefully it'll be kind of a rule looking at what being a doctor is actually like because often okay for me and becoming the doctor is much more glamorous than actually being adopted but having said that today was quite fun is that when we have a long day that lost from 8:30 in the morning to about Thirty in the evening and up until about 6 p.m. we just doing our general day today would you see some of the Cardiology world is my first baseman for the team in the morning and then as you know jobs come up I go up to the doctor's office and do the job so often. that's like writing discharge summaries of Haitian can go home pricing like a transfer lesser so we can transfer them to the adjacent cardiothoracic Texas diseases team or if we've got a patient who is on who's who's on insulin is diabetic and we're not quite sure what was happening with her incident we might specialty. I'm going to comes to other stuff that's kind of beyond our remit as hot doctors even though we've all kind of stuff in medical school even so we still want to discuss a big part of the job doing with the same few days ago I tried making a referral to the vascular surgery team referral is stressful experience or economy because what you have to do when they can refer to as you have the phone up a registrar who is America who's like five or six years older than you are probably and you have to try and make them think that it's worth their time to see your patient has two relevant to them we had a patient who had some problems light with ischemia which is lack of blood supply to his legs and I pulled the vascular surgeon of the vascular surgery registrar asking him if he could review the patient is is dissipation smoker psychology what signs of ischemia of his leg does he have Mission Hospital in depth stop it it's cold and I'll forgetting I see you destroyed over the phone. So you can kind of do need to prepare when making a referral like they're adults with little experience or the old and you are and you need to tell them exactly why you're pulling them exactly what your but since then I've been dealt with the referrals and it's going to last. Late because now I spend a lot of time preparing my Spiel for what I'm going to say so for example this is 71 year olds and someone who's in the hospital because of infective endocarditis because we've grown this bacteria in his blood culture that we're not quite sure of what antibiotic choice replying to you and giving you giving you advice so that's another big part of the job cuz it's a Natalia electronic system a lot of the stuff out of the general admin the other doctors around the UK have to do we pretty much don't have to do it because that's a we got a cold and we're in a different office about prescribing a certain drug and just like typing a few things on the system and it was my tickets prescribed rather than having to go all the way to the ward write it by Hannah drug Shaw and and do all that stuff so a lot of the day today on blood tests can be mounted from just a computer do you have a little power and once you get the hang of using the speaking to this computer system stuff becomes a lot more efficient at least that's what people say it anyway in the evening but then from 6 till 9 that's when we got four of the F12 Foundation you want to talk to is out of cover basically all of the medical laws in the hospital for those three hours so between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. we might just have to make sure the older the medical patients survive and then had my first one of these evening shifts at half past 5 on weather start getting calls from various board so I was covering the day teams handing over patients that they wanted me to look at Sydel refutations on the gas reward who we're going to have CT scans every night and my job was to review the CT scan as and when it arrived and make sure there was nothing ugly about on it that's might be an emergency that we might have to act in the moment Kohl's from from the Reno Rodeo Oregon hunting of a patient who needs to have their blood checked because they're having some blood tests and then again if the blood came back with a very low PH then I'll have to act when I already so the things left over from the day team that caught really wait until the following morning and this is a big debate that happens in and around around teams is that to what extent should you hang stuff over to the 19th because that's a it's a run it's like a random blood test where the results of it won't change anything like there and then that's probably not the kind of thing that you want the nighttime doctor to review because urgent or emergency things should ideally be handed over to them through these II like this was probably the first time like what I was on this late shift that I felt like I was anyway or real doctor because like for the I've been on the Cardiology would have been the most Junior person on the board and all the decisions have been being made by the consultant by the registrar that I'm the one just how to make them happen by talking into the system or whatever and that's great because I have zero experience in everything patients and my Hospital in Cambridge is a touch receptor so we taking the most complicated patients more run the Regency medical school for about a week but when I was in this night shift that's when we all like the four of us are going to have a lot more responsibility so I go to call I'll see me to prescribe some Warfarin for a patient and I didn't like I suppose I could have called a few times I've seen and therefore I felt comfortable to make the decision for myself as to what drug this patient can have a cold prescribed some painkillers for tough agriculture prescribed the blood transfusion check on it right out the form and blood transfusions can have the rest whenever your fence using anyone have a transfusion reaction so they wouldn't have blood types is a B&O and if you give the wrong blood type to a patient then the chances are high that they will die because ABO incompatibility reactions because you'll hold immune system stop blood and then they'll be able to stop people from getting ABO incompatibility so for example you have to take two different blood samples from two different places in like double-check them each time and make sure check the patient's details against the blood full time just make sure this whole thing never happens in addition to that however there are also other reactions that people can have to transfuse blood so you can get people still getting an anaphylactic reaction to transfuse blood even if the blood type matches because of these things wouldn't mind right students anyway the point is blood transfusion is never a hundred percent safe and therefore it was a scary thing when he prescribed me some blood because he run the risk of that you know how I could have reaction review the patient's know to go to talk to the patient tool to the family workouts if it ever have any reactions to tattoos in the past and then ultimately Simon him against his thing and say I'm happy for this patient be given two units of red blood cells where I was cool because one of the patients on the gastro world was having severe nausea ages and I was talking to him and he go quite careful not to because like knows he has one of the most terrible what's a consultant website because you can kind of deal with but nosy I should such a debilitating feeling and this guy been suffering with it for the last five weeks and no one the nest called me asking me to prescribe a third because it just wasn't ready the drugs don't work why isn't he will have slightly different effect and that you know that's a go sickness is called by caused by morphine on chemotherapy than one type of antiemetic agent would be useful a third type of medication be useful and these decisions of what sort of auntie auntie sickness drugs to give to patients can be very complex and it's an emergency on-call doctor can be making because they require a long conversation with a patient looking at their entire history of needle the drugs that the wrong trying to work out why this is happening in the first place it's not really the remit of the nighttime stop it's more the remit of the people. Let me talk to the patient during the day time anyways I got called to the station in the patient is asleep for the last two days because of the sickness and I wasn't really sure what to do so what's the number for the palliative care specialist education specialist specialist doctors are experts at prescribing anti-sickness medication because in the last week's of Life a palliative care patients often are on drugs too combat the new year that I can feel so I called up the doctor and she was very nice of the phone and she asked me the history of the patient explain why near and she admitted she was like so it sounds like this is quite a complicated patient and it sounds like decision about his drug ID sickness Management in the next 10 minutes because you're the night time. That was exactly what you're going to have to do is explain to the patient nicely that you very sorry that you conch medication and you hope that do you know the team in the morning we'll be able to help with that so that's what I did. difficulty sleeping and sleeping tablet for him and give him a little bit of morphine for the pain explain to him that I can't be making a decision about what sort of an igneous rock to give him because it's such a a complex of farron 11 10 minutes at night time left in my shift and at this point I don't really have anything that needs doing myproana encrypted document without any patient of the following is the information just like number the initials of like things I need to do list of things I need to Chase which is a really beautiful air condition pretty nice on a ward space why the Cardiology talk to sometimes hang out and have fun like a knife to a chair look into the computer and because the whole Hospital and then every now and then to prescribe painkillers to patient because they had a fever they had a high heart rate that a low blood pressure never Spurgeon rate was high and there's nothing holdin National early warning score the news which is kind of like a numerical very quickly assessing how sick someone is so let's say you have a heart rate of 100 that would give you a few points in the school that say you have a blood pressure below sasur number you'd have asserted a certain point in the score score of 12 which is really really high higher the score is the molarity should be about the patient and this is only knows if these are the parameters the temperature blood pressure so I go to the patient thanks for the rapid response team was already there and that's something that quite a few hospitals have now they're a team of experienced already experienced nurses and intensive care doctors whose job it is too cold for anyone keep you unwell said the nurse had very clinical the rapid response team into the rapid response message arrived and they were absolutely incredible it would just so calm Under Pressure the patient's will the patient was deteriorating but they just going Straight Outta control Pennypack white voices because it was nighttime and other patients were asleep but it's handled it so calmly and I was just kind of standing there what can I do with the history of the patient was did find out anything else that was such an inspiring way of kind of seeing how they dealt with it because we have had the kind of seminars and classes in dealing with patients but it's very different real life and we both had training from the experience we get with this will be a nice having them but I was more of the backup they were just doing stuff and explaining Saturday went along and being really nice to me and it was great like this is my first time that was what and then it was time to hand over how often is facial stabilizers time to hand over to to the 19th and when I go to the eve of the boardroom for this hand over happens Cambridge 3 years older than me by some of my friends so we got to know each other he did just as well so it goes America Latina Emmanuel College Cambridge when I was in second year she was like 2-3 years of us as well and that was like a really nice and seeing these guys and first day doing like a Twilight shift 13 hours and then out to lunch this like stuff to do in life and then even has a shift when I was in dealing with all these dates that we're coming through every now and then my iPad the time I was bored that's what that that's always been my biggest worry with Jay medicine is that in the back of my head that what if I don't enjoy it and so far it's been a few days on the job I think I think I do enjoy it it snow there is an iPhone there is a lot about men that you have to do this a lot of discharge paperwork paperwork actually yeah I do sort of vaguely know what I'm doing and when I was in the case of you keep your location as in the case of the Santee sickness thing they're always on the people you can come back to help either the rapid response team or your senior kind of chain of commands that if you don't know what to do as soon as you get stuck Q-tip good night"

            "text": " what the mental physical or emotional legal regularly face obstacles in our lives we might sometimes find ourselves Paralyzed by these barriers and we often procrastinate and try to avoid confronting them but one of these obstacles actually presented an opportunity to move forward if we could in fact use them to our advantage this is the argument that Ryan holiday presents in his best-selling book The obstacle is the way which is the subject of this week's episode of book club the series way we discussed under still highlights from some of my favorite books and this book is the ancient lots of turning adversity to Advantage Ryan's rolls and some of the principles of stoicism which is a school of Greek philosophy that really resonates with me and you'll see uses no stories from history to ultimately make the point that we're bound to come across obstacle that every stage of Our Lives set of avoiding them like we normally do by default we have to learn to tackle them and use them to our advantage this process of overcoming obstacles to ultimately live a happier healthier more productive life basically involves three interdependent steps that is perception action and we the first part of the book is about perception which is about how we see and understand the events around us and more importantly how we decide to judge and interpret those event office actions can be a source of strength or they can weaken us if we are emotional subjective and short-sighted only interpret an event badly leading to unhelpful perceptions but by controlling emotions putting things in perspective and examining things objectively we can begin to see obstacles with greater Clarity but the main point of the perception section of the book is one of the key teachings from what is the idea that we are in control of how we interpret events as Professor Dumbledore famously once said nothing is good or bad but thinking makes it so and it's his idea if we come across obstacles or stuff that isn't going away it's very easy for us to become frustrated angry all that stuff so excited we can either let these Primal negative feelings control our response we can choose to give into them all week and then to filter them out and detach ourselves from the situation and look at things a bit more objective respective we often find at least I do that most of my problems objective they aren't really that bad as running right to the preceding eye sees more than is there but the observing eye sees only what is that good controlling your emotions which put it on my Kindle when I read this years ago because it really resonates with me he talks about how we can cultivate the skill of controlling our emotions and he says the Greeks had a wood for this apatheia it's the kind of calm Equanimity that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotion not the loss of feeling altogether just the loss of the harmful and helpful kind don't let negativity in don't let those emotions even get started just say no thank you I can't afford to panic and then one of the technique that he talks about in dealing with negative emotions is defy them with logic which is basically what I do anytime I experienced a negative emotion and at this point I do this so often that it's it's almost become second nature to the point where I'll almost never experienced any strong negative emotion because I know I can just break it down with logic II but it's called action and ready the message here is that whatever game you're trying to play it's the people who take action and act decisively they're the ones who end up winning that game once to read that I really liked is from coach Nick Saban of the University of Alabama American football team which apparently lots of championships and stuff which is apparently a big deal in America but the coach has a mantra which is to focus on the process he says don't think about winning the championship think about what you need to do in this drill on this play in this moment that's the process that think about what we can do today the task at hand I really like this and it ties in with a few of the mattress that I was having my head one of them is one of the ideals of the knights radiant from Brandon sanderson's Amazing Fantasy series The Stormlight Archive and that's life before death strength before Journey before destination for this thing of Journey before destination where we focus on the process rather than the outcome is honestly I think one of the solutions to everything and it's like one of the fundamental pieces of Life advice that all sort of self-help and personal. I'm kind of convergence because like most of the overthinking and anxiety and the water that we have about stuff is wenwood too fixated on the outcome and so if we just focus on the process of the journey a everything becomes more fun because we're actually present in the moment but be less anxious about the outcome care about the outcome we care about the process in the section run also talked about consistency and persistence which is another one of my fields that I always give he writes about Thomas Edison who did over 6,000 experiments to discover the missing element of his filament bulb a lot of other people time trying to invent a working light bulb system it was Thomas Edison who persisted through multiple iterations and overcame the obstacles most successful its overall action is about being consistent and focusing on the process because as Ryan says in the book we Are A2Z thinkers sing about a obsessing over dizzy yet forgetting all about be through why incidentally often the obstacles that stand in the way of us are reading more books is that it takes a lot of time to get through a book like this one and a great way of doing that what is video and that is blinkist and kisses a fantastic app that distills thousands of the world's best-selling books into bite-sized summaries of the key inside which you can read or listen to in around 15 to 20 minutes can go to the father if he does not double speed inside the blankets Celtic crosses video on because I first read this like three or four years ago I did really remember a lot of the key insights and so reading through the blanks for the obstacle is the way helped me kind of remind myself of the key ideas before open the app and read or listen to keep points from a whole range of books like sapiens of mindset or Atomic habits or even ruin holidays books to me personally the way that he's been kissed at 8 to remind myself of summaries of books I've already read or if I'm thinking of reading the book I've got like the books of my to read list that I physically can't get through the mall in a lifetime and so often I'll look at the blank Strait first I'll read or listen to the blank a summary of it and then if it's good then I'll decide to buy the book and that really helps me focus more on the books that I'm going to be most interested in ahead of it to blinkist.com Ali abdaal and that will let you sign up to a completely free 7-Day trial where you can try out all the different blinks all the different books that you like and yeah sons of the mind and the body was the third one will is the discipline of the heart and the soul is Ron writes will is really about inner fortitude and wisdom not just about specific obstacles but about life itself and where the obstacles were facing fit Within will gives us the strength to contextualize events into a hardship and derive meaning from obstacles that we count seemingly overcome and this is all part of what the stoics called our inner Citadel approach life problem in a way that lets us get benefit and power out of them one of the classic ways to Stokes used to do this that rhyme talks about is this idea of premeditating adversity it's about putting ourselves in the shoes of something bad happening to us so that if it does happen we have to pay for it Strings & Noble strengthening the center Citadel is learning to accept the stuff that we can't control this was one of the effective ways of the stoics focus their will by asking himself the simple question of what is in my control and what is not in my control we can't change external factors natural events of the actions of others or even what others think about us but we can control and change internal factors like our emotions judgments attitudes and decisions about is the quote from nature Infinity wrote my formula for greatness in a human is Amal fathy wants nothing to be different not forward not backwards not in all eternity not marry bear what is necessary still less than seen it but love it this is the concept of ammo fatty or fat to the love of Fates and it's great because it's like this ideal state of being where we love whatever it is that happens to us we're not worrying about the past window fixation of the future we don't worry about anything or just whatever happens we accept it first lady but then we learn to love it because that's the wait to be with the pride of perception action and will we can move forward in the knowledge that we can see clearly at Philly and accept the world as as as Marcus Aurelius Road and Seminole meditation stories objective judgment now at this very moment action now at this very moment Willing Acceptance Now at this very moment that is all you need if you like the video I want to learn more about how stoicism can make you healthier happier and more productive five quotes from stoicism really resonates with us and how we applied them to a life to be happy and I'll see you next time bye bye"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is Ali I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to be taking you through the apps on my iPhone so to give this video some some of the structure I'm going to be talking about these apps in six distinct categories and these are all going to be time-stamped in the description oh and the pin comments you can skip around if you feel like it these are fussing organization and productivity second date did you catch that learning study Reading Writing audio music and photo and video so I'll be taking you through the apps I use and describing each one all right so that's five apps in this category and let's start by talking about my email client which is Microsoft Outlook going to be retiring support for that so I switch to Outlook on the recommendation of the bird original fantastic video talking about the best email client for iOS and they decided that Microsoft Outlook was the best and who am I to disagree with them yeah I've been using it for the last few weeks already like it. I like to use is called testicle and this does cost money it's available for iOS and available to Mac OS and the main reason I like it is because it's got this really good natural language processing thing on it so let's say I was right pathology lecture tomorrow at 10 a.m. at LT1 and it automatically knows what the event is where it is what time it is. Just makes the process of adding stuff to my calendar so so convenient and I found this particular helpful when I was a student and want to have loads of like lectures and stuff to record on my calendar number 3 my to-do list is called things and I talked about this my video about what's on my Mac as well again it's going to my cap I really like it is very well designed it would be nice to do list and getting things done good but by the way he should read it approach to productivity and you can sort it into the different areas of your life so I'm going area for work and area for 6 Play My Side company my online courses my YouTube stuff from Tech videos coming up this is sort of what I've got planned to do this again but I'm more than happy to pay money for premium apps that I think a little bit of value to my life in terms of productivity and open phone number for is not really a nap more of an indispensable utility in my life. I already can't function without and that is Google Drive cuz I still absolutely everything in my life on Google Drive photos for you know from my sixth-form years all the way through the 6 years ago what does the word folder scroll that design could you every every pretty much everything I've ever done in my life for the last eight years has been put on Google Drive I absolutely love having Google Drive I pay the 80 pounds a year for the winter by option and of use about three hundred gigs of it so far it's just incredible and if you're using how to Cloud backup solution. Then I highly recommend the Apple use for that is 1password I think everyone knows about pulse-width manager these days there's like one password lost pause or whatever they called these days to be honest I've been using it for so long that I've already found no reason to try any others it's not pay for I paid the 40 pounds a year whatever it cost for the subscription and I think to be honest that's worth every penny because an account getting compromised especially if he will you go your whole life on the internet then that could be really really bad and what is 40 pounds a year price of Peace of Mind apps for learning and education and has three things that I want to talk about her first date Rosetta Stone which is a fantastic language learning app and who are also incident response the last few months I've kind of been a bit on and off with that I need to develop on reading very good pic of the Moon called Atomic Habits by James Cleary Stephanie take the everyday or just do a little bit of Japanese practice easy kind of gave me for the whole process fun and it makes you say stuff out loud so you practically speaking as well as in actually being able to understand the language that's pretty good second leave my flashcard needs our use Quizlet these days I recently switched to Quizlet from Monkey I see thank you for medical but I thought to Quizlet because it's cool and it feels better designed and it's just pretty and it makes fun of going through my flashcards a bit more fun to do rather than a chore I used to find thank you for the tour but of course I still haven't found my phone and I don't know what I'll let the other go light on the decks below the stuff using much of them through Pinnacle School years but back in the day in my preclinical years and years 1 2 3 I use Anki to memorize anatomy and memorize pharmacology all the list of drugs that we have to learn as medical students I was ready for that so yeah alright let's talk about apps for reading now and I absolutely love reading reading on my phone that much cuz I'm going to iPad Pro this thing or my plan for this video as well but I still have six after reading on my phone firstly is the Kindle app and yeah it's great Loyola my books are on Kindle I don't need physical books anymore I've gone completely paperless and Ashley that book reading that work on how to spend 10 minutes while sitting on the toilet today so the Kindle app is very useful for those what's 11 it's nice to use you can like turn the brightness all the way down so doesn't really strain your eyes too much and yeah I love candle that spoke about pocket which is what I used to save articles to read later would recommend this other stuff like instapaper out there again I've been using pocket since I don't know God knows how long using it so I can reschedule the kind of nice looking back through my archived articles and seeing what I was reading when I was like 16 years old however long ago that was but yeah pocket is grateful that you don't have the time to read right now but you've come across the lane keeping to save it and you can read it face a little bit later on today I've got the medium app which I really enjoy using I'm subscribing to medium I pay the five pounds a month or whatever it is I like the day to email that has my medium digest I just kind of nice when I click on the link in the email that open the app rather than in a browser window very nice reading experience why you should stop being so hard on yourself experience good for highlighting stuff about reader which is my RSS feed reader on the Arthur RSS feeds with that as well on I came across an article on the sweet setup we spoke about the best RSS feed reader for iOS and said read it was the one and yeah it's really great so I connect my Feedly account to it and in my feed the account I subscribe to all the different feeds and fight let's have a look at the categories of the moment minimalism productivity money medical ethics and I intend to expand these overtime because I follow about 50 different plugs and it's a bit annoying anything interesting to read that front would recommend having an RSS feed aggregator if you follow blogs like the client is tweakbox yeah it's good to wrap it just does what it should I'm finally an app that I like to have is actually Goodreads so I read a lot of books or at least like think so and every time I start reading in my Kindle it and go to the option to automatically add to my Goodreads so my Goodreads is like a running total of all the books I've ever read and actually when I made a Goodreads account first few years I took the time you know take a few hours it's like quite a few hours to like older Brookside I could remember ever having read into Goodreads and just give him a quick rating out of 5 based on what I feel with them I think that is really nice I really like doing this whole tracking thing and because I am hey I'm going to be reading books you know I'm quite often for the rest of my life to see every year you know you've read the books you've read these are your favorite ones read a definitely worth taking the time like if I've spoken to 70 people who say that it would be kind of cool to track out of the book they've read films they washed out so it's tough but it's just that initial setup process we have to add everything you've ever read fun would recommend if you have already alright so let's talk about apps for writing and there are five things in this category and firstly is notability which is an app that, I've had an extensive video about this that's going lots of you but it's I'll actually Eddie today I've just gotten back from one of my late evening shifts at the hospital at finished about 9 p.m. but at one point my iPad run out of battery and that was really annoying except like until it took a few minutes to get get some juice back but in that time I would have my seniors was giving me a list of stuff to do so I have to open up notability on my phone the note that I have for the day where do I use notability to manage my to-do list I'll do 55 that some point but the high for the day was already synced thanks to you know the iCloud single whatever it is able to add stuff to my to do list and jobs to do at the hospital and then once my iPad goes more battery I went straight back to it and it just updated play Prince very easy to get lost and encrypted in the app that I tend to use for note taking if I'm writing a piece for my email newsletter on my blog you can check it out at description is bear redesigned app you can write in markdown is good for my saying is quite simple is quite a minimalistic kind of interface I think I pick this up again because there was a review from The Verge saying that that was the best writer I like no taking out for iOS a few years ago I switched from Evernote to bear and it was quite easy to import all my notes across pretty good stuff on it and then I copy and paste into my blogger in my email and it's just nice very minimalistic no taking up recently though I've decided to give Evan another try why Avenue is now on my front page and I'm starting to use Avenue again because I think it's a bit more full featured and I want a full-featured note taking app to take notes for my upcoming postgraduate medical exam Evernote bear one that old kind of note taking apps for iOS and decide which one is my favorite but you know I've got my notebooks for this is my Obstetrics & Gynecology so the best clinical skills governance Bubba blah all of these different bits of the syllabus and then the ideas that Within These I'll have separate notes for each of the topics I've already made a video kind of explaining this in a bit more detail that would also be linked in the description if that's the sort of thing that floats your boat so ever know is what I'm using right now to take notes but while I was in medical school and pretty much all through it I did use OneNote to take notes and Yakima notebook that has older very Michael subjects in it and let's go into extended clinical cases and then there's all these different notes that I've got for each of these various things and yeah the reason I moved away from it is because I didn't like a few little things about it but I'll be doing some more testing later on and the reason I flew around my phone is because it's kind of nice to refer back to my med school notes at some points if if I have to finally on this little comes under the category of writing the app that for my journaling habit is day one and I really really really loved a woman against something that I subscribe to the premium version of which is like 2 pounds a month or something like that and the other one is that you can just very easily at your journal and there was a thing all right I think on the sweet setup. twitter.com is that quantity is what makes quality in a journal like the more quantity garter overtime the Bedford Journal is going to be so occasionally I have these stents where I put something in the journal like every night I go for a few weeks that posting and you can make different journals of it with as well so I've got one for my personal Journal I've got one full memorabilia it's where I take photos of birthday cards or In a Sentimental items and things stuff that I'm not going to carry around with me but I think is remember that I have a journal phone noise coming from from people by YouTube and Instagram so here's one from from today actually High I've done my Beamer next week has been very helpful as soon as you get this done a reply here's another one from some Australian who going to med school in once they think you suggest I do stuff like that it's really nice keeping a record of and you can just kind of flick through an disabled images and it told me to sing to my iCloud and stuff obviously so yeah I used a one for my personal Johanna linked to memorabilia on to record not coming audio and music and therefore thing going to talk about hair firstly Spotify as my music thing of choice I'm fully apple Fanboy his watch in every respect except I have to behave music on switching to it twice actually because I was like I really wanted like apple music already want to do this little guy that uses Apple everything that's going to home. Freehold what's the house I wanted to be with a guy but you know every time I tried I've ended up hating the user experience about the music Sorry Apple if you I can probably not but I stink spotify's a better product and of course I pay for Spotify Premium and I'm still in the student discount actually thanks to unidays respond to the previous video so you can check them out if you still owe student or if you just graduated from being a student cuz you can like drag out the student discount for a year graduate which is like a pretty mind-blowing feature anyway yeah but if I use Audible I absolutely love audible it's like probably one of the apps that has most affected my life in a positive way and at the moment I'm listening to Words of Radiance by Brandon son the second book in The Stormlight Archives would recommend and yeah there's various things that I've listened to on Audible adults put an affiliate Link in description I'll make like a few pounds to buy coffee from now if I have to do a long car Journey or long train journey I don't know. Look forward to that time anymore I just got to think today while skateboarding home from work on my boosted board mini I was listening to I was listening to what then when I go home and go to life is really really really good bit so just kind of lay on the sofa I had Alexa I want to text you that I had Alexa at the back playing the audio book what I was kind of lounging on the couch and it's really nice that I absolutely love what The Late Show podcast is over costs less of a quick look so real demanding his collection cookie cups therapy, my favorite have been the ground up show if I'm not develop which is very good and also the Tim Ferriss show that I've been thank you for years and years or whatever that was a big like Sam Harris's podcast occasionally and really good when I'm not listening to an audiobook if I put my headphones in or my airpods in airport then I listen to a podcast long drives my cousin and if you don't try podcast you should check them out on overcast so far as been my favorite Apple do admittedly I have already tried many others and finally an app that I find really useful to have is the Ulta guitar tabs app where you can pretty much type in any song on the planet and it will give you the quotes for that song So This is actually how I learn to play the piano like next to me just like put bring up a song so we're like today was practicing in my blood by Shawn Mendes the song cuz you can like transpose it down by like 8 semitones if you have to if you kill a bass voice I got it and you play the chords and you sing the song I had a really cool and if you go guitar guitar and background over that supposedly I didn't sound that if you play the guitar or like if you're ever around friends and some it's a really great app that you can just bring the codes up and going to play along and you feel cool because you know you're helping everyone have fun by playing playing stop on guitar but while this video is going through a really long time if you still with us thank you what's the law having fun there for apps that I want to talk about in the photic a screen so firstly is preview and previews not that I used to plan out my Instagram feed at one point I was trying to kind of maintain a theme keep to a similar static the previous let you have load up photos you can cut and move them around unless I want this photo of the hamster next to the chicken and you can kind of like move them around and it shows you your previous feed as well so you can kind of plan things aesthetic Lisa previous week after that Lightroom this is me at 10 to take a selfie at work yesterday and using the new portrait mode on iOS so maybe you'll see the portrait mode of this image on iOS is that a pretty much has a lot of the features of the desktop app so on my MacBook use Lightroom editing but you know that's how I want to snap a quick photo at a restaurant or something Phantogram I can bring it into Lightroom and apply presets to it so this is preset pack but I bought expensive actually give you some nights at the preset seat news I think this is the do you travel presets app yes, good I intend to expand my collection of presets a bit more I need to just a lot nicer than the filter that you get built into Instagram and then you can tweak stuff about the images as well as if I wanted to change exposure on Highlights whatever I'd be able to do that using the Lightroom app that would recommend if your whole photo editing. Post made by Adobe and this is actually how I make all of the beautiful thumbnails for my YouTube videos so I just take a screenshot of the video bring it into sparkpost whoa okay is loading loading breaking into sparkpost and then let's say let's look at this one iPhone 10s Max attack on it and then you can change the text you can like apply you can like darken and lighten the background I just like a nice easy way of generating thumbnails on Yachts to be honest I could how to photoshop and do exactly the same thing but just so convenient having an app to do it like we'll have to do a screenshot the bit of the video that I want to my phone open up sparkpost put some texts on the edge of it back to my computer so I can upload it to YouTube by process but it's a having to open Photoshop I made this before but pretty much anything I can do to reduce the friction that it takes to do stuff in this content production space is going to be worth it I'm finding this category in the app that I use to Vlog when I'm logging on my iPhone with another very often is filming Summit Place wonderful it lets you film in 4k and lets you change the bitrate instead it really hide this tutorials on the internet on how to use fulfill approach with Max but you can also shoot in different frame rates on here is a little bit from my Vlog where I was blocking my emergency department so you can see what some of the filmic pro footage looks like on the iPhone 10s Max filmed in 4k usually are filming 25 frames per second but if I want so I can switch to 1080P and 100 frames per second to film in that butter a slo-mo let's let's go Dover slate and then like the camera would be but in a funny sort of logging purposes I really like filmic Pro as my video app of choice oh I'm finally one thing I forgot to mention that number five is one that I can use my Instagram stories and that is cut story that you can just upload a video if I'm free, filming myself singing I can upload a video it'll automatically cut that video into 15 second segments so that when you post an Instagram story you can like put someone in a row without without without having much of a break between between the thing so Yakutsk and that's a big block. If you don't follow me on Instagram you might like to I post photos of me and my friends when we were at work after photos and videos of myself singing songs if you're into that I really hope you gain something interesting from that if you want to see a more detailed kind of review of any of the apps that I've used busy let me know in the comments or if you go any other things any suggestions for me to talk about I want to be doing more videos like this one and I love talking about taking a nap and all of this stuff so yeah thank you so much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet please consider doing so have a lovely day and I will see you hopefully in the next video goodnight"

            "text": " hinge don't show you my new profile I'll show you my Tinder and Bumble very similar has my profile on Tinder and Bumble let's not see anyone else okay friends will come back the channel is that time of the year we are doing the classic what's on my iPhone my favorite iPhone apps genre ask type of video I'm just going to go through them in order because I've kind of got them in a specific order and I'll skip over the boring Facebook message on Instagram because everyone knows what they do I'll talk about some of the more interesting apps that I've maybe like discovered this year or that I've been using and I particularly interesting way in my opinion so maybe you'll get some ideas about apps that you can install onto your iPhone Android phone if you want those heathens but seem to be watching this video to some reason anyway let's go all the way everything like timestamps video description pin come in or around so you can skip two things that you want to see if you really want video cuz I have no idea how long I'm going to go in anyway number one Fantastical is my calendar app it's not staying it's kind of expensive for a calendar app the main reason I like it is because it's got some pretty decent natural language processing which if I were to write for example first date with Jane 10 p.m. at fit cities it would recognize like older the various bits of that so I would understand the location understand the time and it's quite a nice way of dealing with I don't have a first date with Jane I wish next we have the app draft and this is something that I've newly discovered this year a few months ago and I've been using it practically daily ever since draft is that it's a very quick and easy note taking up so ultimate clean no having too fast around with the new note wasn't then you can pretty much whatever you want and then that becomes a drop and so then you've got your inbox list of various trials that you can have on hair and usually I keep this as a as a short term memory RAM Random Access Memory type thing so if throughout the day I'm having any kind of soil do I need to write down so if it's an idea for a podcast on audio for video or just an idea of something in Life or even like ability to do list then offer the easiest thing to do is just open up draft on my iPhone and then I'll write down that but late let's talk about notion is probably my favorite app of the year that I discovered and I use notion for a ton of stuff I will link two of my other notion videos in the video description one of them Productions in Ocean and how it works specifically aimed at students and the second is about how I use notion as a residence calendar so if you haven't seen that one I basically make a list of everything that's every kind of content that I've consumed will that sounds really wear contacts Anaconda Canta La cancion Black Books podcast videos weather that I've been that does resonates with me in some way and goes into my residence calendar so recently that was this water towers Peace by Seth Godin and when he added like bring the article UND view link to the article recently as well out there was this Fantastical to collect pull Graham Courtney lesson to unlearn and it's going to that I don't need to take some notes on it so essentially anytime I come across something cool and goes into the residents calendar can you use notion for a ton of other things so I use as the idea Refinery for my various kind of bits of content I create so I've got like this massive ass in box of all the ideas that I'm currently working on that I've come across from various bit and then there's Maude ideas in draft an email newsletters if you want to check out my email newsletter from the video description once it's published to go than to be published random video audio track my entire life and I'll be making loads more videos about notion throughout the throughout the next few months cuz I just got like 10 different use cases for it every month or so I'm I'll bring you a sandwich like an odd notion to my life so yeah probably my favorite time of the year to have like this private life OS I have like a daily highlight of the day and this was like a productivity tip that I picked up from the book make time which I think of it has so much about how it's important to have like a single highlight that you want to accomplish that day because of productivity is that things to do and not wasting time on the stuff that we don't want to do and so for example hear my thought of the day was filmed at 6 p.m. but you know I just like to write down the one thing that I'm working play suffer example hear what is this notion video will tamoxifen still show video Story Woody voice over there already done a few different things that I want to work on so I'm trying to build a habit where I check into my Dania highlight thing for the last 10 days I've been on holiday and I feel it's fair enough to not have you know protiviti mindset orientation goal when you are on holiday in Japan CDL message that appeared on my to-do list app I use notion for most like project management he kind of thing so things that require my attention of repairs time but I use to do is to things like a cool Nani who's my grandmother and water the plants and insurance and therapy and send my bill company and electric meter readings are things like that also if I ever need to make a shopping list for going to Sainsbury's whatever then I'll put it in todoist go to go different categories of different things like I've got this weekly reminder to publish the weekly book Austen publish my emojis that said which repeats every Sunday so I try and check the rest once a day just to make sure that I'm on top of the menial tasks that I need to be doing I think it's nice to have that reminder every other day that I should probably call my grandma is Castro and initially I was using Uber cost for several years but the thing about Castro is that it's library and inbox feature so I listen to a podcast for too many to keep up with really big it gives you like an inbox it's been awhile since I've been through this inbox based on the titles of the podcast yourself in 5 years left about to MyQ and you can add it to the top of your queue or to the bottom of your key so that's all that it wasn't because it'll come up after I've listened to the stuff I wasn't already how to resolve conflict like a martial artist don't care the moral philosophy of the good place. Care Affiliates like Showdown funny positive feedback loops I can go through all of the episodes of come up in the park and then just threw get rid I don't care about the ones that interest me to the top of my queue or to the bottom like you and this Carnival Mikey looks like we've got this bed or with interviewing Tim Ferriss that I'm listening to the moment if you ever said the bulletproof radio this episode of the alternative TV which is run by a friend of mine Noah Kagan episodes of the dark service show which is one of the new podcast but each episode is only like a minute-long so that seems quite intimidating is not ready so yeah that's my choice just finished listening to the dragon reborn by Robert Jordan so I need to buy another one and listening to audible so much for that this month total and total in my life that's my life I listen to 13 days and 15 hours of audio books on average I'm listening to about one or two hours each day because I commute an hour to work and an hour back from work and so I usually listen to all the bullet while I'm in the car next we have Evernote which I still sore sometimes kind of used so I use Evernote at DeSoto long-term memory of my second brain a link to the article Tumblr that talk about this in more detail later on things that I care about what is that book club book publishing building second brain business concentration pregnancy decision-making choosing the right even boxing entrepreneurship essays filing cabinet look up Network TV and the ideas. When I come across top I put it into notion if it's like a resident calendar paste if I'm taking notes on it then I'll put it into evernote so that if I'm writing something about how to study I can look at my when's my when's my studying thing up yeah I can look through my notes for studying and I can find bits that I've aggregated overtime from various different sources have Lightroom which is the app that I used to edit photos before and I'll set you can see if I before after a picture from work before before and after before and I tend to use Lightroom presets in a few other run them edits to edit photos for my Instagram page so you can follow Instagram if you want already so I've got like a gentle that I'm going to show you I have a nice comments folder where I screenshot nice comments that I've gone from like YouTube and Instagram and things and I put it into the General Tso. sad about life I can just kind of look through my nice Cummins gentle and The Accidental pick-me-up bear I used to use a lot before I discovered Ross so I still do sometimes he's bad for like long-form writing for example if I'm taking notes like people to notice I was taking a cardiovascular physiology textbook while I was on an airplane so I can reuse notion cuz it doesn't have offline Pages or if I'm writing pages of my email newsletter that I tend to write them in there so this was from the 25th an event 1900 yeah I just use there is a sort of long-form writing kind of note-taking hybrids what about but I'm kind of phasing bear out and replacing it with a droptine ocean together and we have Spotify of course and then I've got my playlist various years I'll add my Spotify profile down in the video description as well say he care about the sort of songs that I listen to this is my playlist for this year being a doctor Ed Sheeran Elton John the Westlife does Lewis Capaldi classic boy fight love it like studying podcast productivity link generator hang out and active online we have 228 people online at the moment I think in total over 3,000 people that are on this ever since it's kind of nice little bit hole some people sharing book recommendations all that stuff so I'm quite enjoying this code medically is the confidential messaging app that my Hospital uses so I'm not going to be showing you what's in there but it's video deal because if for example I'm on call that I Mark myself as uncool for obstetrics on the app answer if anyone else in the hospital needs to get in touch with the doctor on call for obstetrics they would message me by the app directly what is an app that again as a hospital thing to it's like a tectonic management so I check it every now and then COI my uncle today I'm on call tomorrow if someone messages me and says hey do you want to come to my birthday party on the 12th of January I would say sorry let me check open up mediratta and it would show me what Rosa is microgard another hospital kind of app this is where our microbial guidelines are so for example that's a need to prescribe an antibiotic for sepsis origin then it would show me what antibiotic should prescribe this varies depending on which hospital you're in because the different bacteria growing in different hospitals and around the areas have different sensitivities to different types of antibiotics and conveniently my Google Maps boring and then on the first day I paid we've got pocket doctor which is a few more guidelines things medicine the BNF which is the British national formulary so that say I can't remember the dose of clindamycin I can type it in here open up clindamycin and it would tell me who the indications I see the reasons why you might give clindamycin and what doses I should give so I often use this daily to check drug doses induction is again Hospital thing it helps you I'm looking on here but it's actually a help you calculate various things so in medicine there are hundreds of different scoring systems for different conditions for example let's say you go to conditional atrial fibrillation there is a scoring system called that last which is like 10 different criteria that decide whether you should get a blood thinner medication or not and it's annoying to remember all these criteria off the top of your head so MD calc is a great app for you know that just has all of these different scoring system which is another medical thing my medical folder but that has got like official evidence-based guidelines for the different things so if for example I see a patient who's got out of vaginal bleeding due to cervical ectropion and I can't remember what will. I would look up on bmj best practice which would tell me the evidence-based guys to how to deal with that particular condition to be the apps that I actively want myself to use or does apps that are just Texas to Temple I want myself to use drafts notion and bear because that is me writing stuff I want myself to use Lightroom because that's posting stuff Instagram I kind of want myself to use Discord Instagram Twitter Facebook YouTube on page number two so that just adds that very slightly refraction that I have to swipe in order to go on Instagram which means more I think partly because some page to anyway I'll get the boys up here but reader I think it's interesting Rita is my RSS feed aggregator of choice and essentially every block that I read that I want to be subscribed to I add to my arthas we do it so I've had a gradual that but very different categories like basic human connection or what I can do is I can just hold it very things that I'm on red and I can go to the list and then I think about reader is that you can very easily let's say I discovered this post from Shopify that lets this post from being why you don't need more time for self-care that's a wants to read that but I didn't have time right now I would be able to immediately added to instapaper which is what I'm going to talk about next and instapaper is how I read stuff offline essentially so if I want to read something but I want to read it right now I will add it to instapaper then when I'm like on the toilet or on the bus and then I'd be able to read stuff it's so unlike because the nice thing about instapaper is that when you highlight stuff to hear I've highlighted something a hedge fund investment Red Raider describe the importance of Letting Go for Social Security iPod I did that because but also what I've done is that it automatically syncs with Evernote on this is very exciting so there are going folder could read was born that in a moment essentially like what it does is that synchronizes old my Kindle Highlights instapaper Highlights into an Evernote notes for each individual logical so this was an article from waitbutwhy how to pick a career that actually fits you and instead of grabbing the whole article which is like ten thousand words it's just synchronized all of my instapaper highlights and now this I will just see my highlights and this incredibly useful and the Soviet the poet this is Uncle Reed wise link down below I don't use the app for it cuz they're developing the Appleton beta but it's actually worried why doesn't that it could have synchronizers all of your Kindle and into highlights and it sends you an email every day with five of those random highlights does a good way of revisiting lessons that you might have highlighted when you were reading a book or something because I subscribe to The Economist and so I would like the financial times so if it's like a magazine you probably heard of it because I wanted to become more like acquainted with current affairs in the news and stuff and I read it maybe once and I never picked on it since so I'm just going to uninstall The Economist who got time for that am I right islita I need to cancel my subscription for as well have the Kindle app because if I'm going to read something but I don't have my physical Kindle on me then I will just read on the Kindle app and at the moment I'm reading time of bread which is the first book in The Blood and Bone Trilogy by with the name Tony Gwynn yeah the first the first quartet which was the faithful and the Fallen series was incredible to finish. And now I'm reading of Blood and Bone nothing like endless Waters like that stuff so if I wanted to highlight and then that would stink behind the scenes why read wise in to my Evernote notebook by tensional to highlight fiction because you know what's the point safaris boring Instagram is boring messenger sparkpost is really good at this Adobe thing that I used to generate all the thumbnails my videos so you just kind of put an image or a screenshot of something and then you can add text to it you cannot log onto it and it helps me get this kind of disc thumbnail style which some people say the building but I think it looks quite pretty so I don't mind passagem building a second brain and the fulfilling penalty for not having dog watching service in theory let me watch those offline I haven't really used it too much on my phone cuz I tend to just watch stuff on the computer if I'm actually going through an online course but it's not having the phone up YouTube studio is for YouTube creators I chose your analytics in your comments and stuff is really good because it gives you stop airplane mode guitar tabs for pretty much any song in the world and so if I decide hey I will I want to play Blank Space by Taylor Swift I would just go on this I'll search for Blank Space by Taylor Swift I was already in my favorites list. It would tell me the chords able to play on the guitar and I can transpose up and down if a particular song is too high or too low for me to sing Facebook is boring hinge profile what else could that would be weird but this is my hinge profile be curious if you've gone this far and SRI really long video please critique my in profile so this is like my first picture I'm overly competitive but you know the truth of the Hutt I'll never get final this picture I think I look really weird Universal Cambridge Mustang liberal open this is a picture of me and my brother graduation album Harry Potter trivia nephew and niece of mine the key to my heart is a midline sternotomy this is a medical joke that a friend of mine came up with a it's not even me a picture of me in Paris in this a picture of meat thanks squashing my jeans couldn't have any kid with me so yeah my hinge profile and to see which means I think some people messaging me or of God few different matches. Tinder and Bumble very similar has my profile on Tinder and bumble I'm at Uni doctor just to get a hang of things I spend most of my evenings making YouTube videos singing Ed Sheeran I think I wrote this ages ago all the pictures of me and my friends on my Tinder profile Tinder not going so well is hinge and then Bumble again dating up about mache my profile is getting billed anyway Google Drive Boring Google photos photos skillshare documentary videos I like having after today so that it reminds me that there and then I can use them I've lost so much money on bitcoin Barclays banking Monday banking American Express banking 04 accounting for my business on my fitness pal should be in there because I was using that to track calories at one point and then I decided I can be bolted so interesting stuff like on page 3 4 and 5 and 6 I've got this random apps and utilities that I use very very occasionally is there anything interesting oh my email app is superhuman and that's this one over here BSO a $30 a month but yeah it is the fastest and best email app I used to live route order food he's just in case need to order food the DJI app will give me a British Airways booking.com and stuff pretty much all the way up to my phone I hope you found something in there that was a vaguely vaguely helpful if you've gone this far in the video thank you for watching please do take my dating profile cuz I'm still single so I need all the advice and the help that I can get hyperlink to hear to another playlist of like kind of kind of thing videos if you're into that sort of thing thank you next video"

of the class where I cook a chicken salad sweet potato Teriyaki type thing in a productive fashion with my instructor Kim thank you Elsie of the end right so let's talk about the recipe so we going to be actually applying the principles that we've gained from these lost several videos and putting them all together to make these amazing recipes Teriyaki salad I think I mentioned earlier that's if I can find something in the grocery store that is pre-chopped that I use a lot then I will buy it so in this instance that sweet potato and I cook a lot with sweet potato is very nutritious it's quite delicious not many people dislike it so you can do some really great things with it so we are going to prep our sweet potato first and foremost I have spots on sweet potato and butternut squash mixed you can get just butternut squash if you if you prefer or you can get a mixed or you can just buy regular sweet potatoes and diced him up yourself but for efficiency work that's ever going to open these up and move into the bowl now we're going to use our fancy oil that I was telling you about earlier and what you want to do we're going to use about 4 tablespoons in there let me get my excellent because it doesn't need to be precise you just want to give it a goodly amount little bit more we're going to roast these while we cook the chicken I'm so we're going to pop these in the oven so that they can be cooking while you are cooking and preparing chicken efficiency efficiency okay you want to make sure that you completely cover everything cuz they all should be glistening but you wanted to everything has a little bit of a Sheen is again we're going to put it in the point of hot oven and say you wanted to they always are oil okay so that step one we then are going to put these on to our baking sheet the oil that will keep it from sticking some of them will stick get away with from it out evenly and you can I mean this is a great side with just about anything to make oven and let it while we make our chicken play minutes in 20 minutes to degrees in the oven right sweet potatoes now and now we need to prep the chicken so go for it need to open the packet you're going to open an app and then you can cut it into either strips or you can cut it into little chunks that we've obviously washed your hands okay to take that and then statement down whatever gets the job done that's what's important so you can make it like I said this is smaller as you want or larger strips want to have them is even as you can simply be you're obviously going to want to let them cook evenly so this recipe calls for 425 chicken breasts boned and skinned another quick tip is if you have frozen chicken breasts and you want to use a night if you send me defrost it but it's still a little bit Frozen on that makes it a lot easier to chop okay right hands as soon as you touch the chicken and obviously operate with the chicken you then went to immediately wash your hands and dispose of any container never going to put it in our pan and we are going to use our caroteno oil and you're going to want it have about 2 tablespoons worth in there and then we're going to put the chicken in to that we're going to go ahead and cook it on rhop we're now going to cook a chicken in the Cortina oil and as you can see I'm cutting it and I will leave that and while we're going to do our chopping soap brought out something then I got just for you because you told me that you didn't like to to to get it and effectively what it is is it is a chopper or onion and what have you been there needs up and wash your vegetables right okay so we have are courgettes here okay and we need our nice and what we're going to do is we're going to cut off the ends and then we're going to cut them into chunks now I cut as you see three in a row again this is pretty fat shaming is it when you actually cut if you can line things up I've been doing them individually it does take lifetime again if you're not going for a gourmet competition and I think you need to worry too much about it then use this wonderful Gadget and ask you to do is put one of those in there and then not your hand down on the soft yep it works really well Incredibly Close by definitely well done excellent okay I've got that now I'll because we're going to be together you don't necessarily have to clean it out red onion I add a lot of flavor and that was one of those things I didn't realize until I inventoried the kinds of recipes I was being attracted to actually a lot of them okay yes go for it incredible invention chicken cooked just a little bit longer second is not clear so I don't know if the camera can see this but that they have that that's still raw looking and we're going to put that aside I'm just using the same bowl that we mixed the sweet potatoes in a butternut squash cuz it still has some oil in it I'm going to do that and now we're go set that aside after a moment and we are going to cook these guys in it you may want to add a little bit more oil and maybe another two tablespoons too too much this recipe does use quite a bit spot again that's why I use the healthier stuff hey so we're going to want to stir frequently with this Cooks get everything covered with the oil and the another eight minutes tender going to add the garlic as well so chopped garlic you can buy this Frozen and it's wonderful and then you don't have to chop his yourself add about 2 teaspoons of this and I don't serve it up so I just have like one big Tupperware thing behind you and I just dumped it in there and then I stupid enough for each serving how many days I would say you get a good three meals out of that free meals in 3 days or 3 meals is in 100 days okay how do you know when that's pretty cool thing exactly if it's done and they're obviously tests and we can talk about what this test for the most part it's not going to be bad but you can probably do is just take a piece out and try it what you think but you haven't answered to see a little bit of brown and going on with the courgettes there so I know that's getting to the point that I want it to be at then what we're going to do is we're going to add the chicken back in Fair definition for that up the next thing we're going to do is our teriyaki sauce and we're going to want she's about 3/4 of a cup and a this is not one of those ingredients that you need to do super-precise with so if you just have a cop and you just put it you know everything left but a quarter full you'll be fine play something spraying code everything you're going to want to put some fresh ground pepper just look like it adds just enough like if you put too much pepper on it you can taste it don't put enough you can taste it at all how to get a watery sweet potatoes in the oven and now we're going to make our sauce well it's about to become more of a song and imma show you how to make a paste tablespoons of water sunflower and we are going to take about two tablespoons again we don't have to be precise here with that I had a big scoop you're welcome to measure this out up gets a bit sticky at first go ahead and try some of this sticky or smooth okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to look like milk but it's really not okay if you want to stir that you'll start noticing the chemistry that starts thickening oh yeah it is sickening the peace I just to make it to give it a little bit more than around there oh that's looking amazing does that just mean it stays warm but doesn't burn or and making sure that everything's white and that the juices run clear and that there's no any can see it's kind of flaky they're not sure if the camera can see that it looks like the inside I was saying the chicken McNuggets exactly yeah so that it shows you that that you're done certainly when you first start cooking I think it's probably fine and to be expected that you might want to cut into it and just double-check and make sure that's good with us that's awesome so that doesn't need and now I can turn that off until we are ready to add the sweet potato portent if you're doing a lot of roasting I would say and you want to make sure that you've got to roast right and you want to be able to take it out of the oven in the correct temperature 80/20 list cuz I figured we were going to be doing a lot of roasting they roasting vegetables but not necessarily the maids but certainly if you've got one as a gift American and Teriyaki sweet potato salad into a storage container pop it in the fridge when it comes time to actually serving it that's what we're going to show you how to do a head of iceberg lettuce you're more than welcome to buy this pre-washed and already in the salad section of his most grocery stores but it is a lot of money only when it sits in my frigate sits in there longer than other salads do so I have just bought it in and had I've washed it and now we're going to serve it up and it is going to be so easy leaves with your hands as you feel that I usually say where to put it across the plate in about two layers thick if you love ice Burgandy love lettuce go for it however you feel really only additional comments you might want to tear it up a little bit just to make it easier for you to eat cold absolutely fabulous cold I like it but just makes me feel like I don't know what you can do is put the lettuce tear the lettuce up put it in one container and then put your teriyaki chicken and sweet potato mixture in another and then you can microwave at the office or wherever the chicken mixture and then assemble there after otherwise you can mix it all up in it and take it into work no problem the gas so there's one obviously you want to put that as many plates and serving together as you require probably maybe a little bit too much out of this one and maybe do a little bit less I'm in again think about think about you with your fork is going to do it doesn't it drive you crazy when you let go and get a salad and the leaves are so huge cuz you're trying to eat that plus everything else so I try to think about what I do you know what size would be dainty they're going to eat that's okay we're going to want to mix everything together they're just slightly Browning more so the sweet potato will Brown squash that's mixed in there in a pop that all in the mixture now we're going to want to mix it we can get it it's nice and warm and just possible what's the weather today in into Tupperware or food container of this is the size than I typically I think it's a war leader 3.98 and then you want to leave it to cool before you put it into the fridge but then you can serve it from there and do it like this so assuming that you get and you feel that up for your meal when you come time you would go directly from the and then you could put it in a in a smaller bowls today for an individual portion heated up in the microwave always when I'm reheating these items I do it on the lowest setting of the microwave simply because I don't like food splatter and also it keeps it more evenly they have to do it a little bit longer I'm in the microwave but it Heats more evenly again you can see this is warm on cold try this out. Let us have a bit of butternut squash sweet potato whatever the hell that is all together so the cleanup isn't that extensive is just as good cold you know when and how much you can't but that should last two at least three meals chicken salad Teriyaki sweet play something I need to get better at cooking and so I start using the lessons that Kim told me that day that we talked about in the sky pause my life so you're going to be seeing more cooking related stuff in my day in the life Vlogs I'm sure so thank you for watching and if you want to see an example of what my day in the life of bugs look like"

            "text": " hey friends welcome back to the blog in this study with me video I'll take you through a day in my life during a weekend on call for Obstetrics & Gynecology where I try my best to squeeze in some studying during moments of downtime the date starts at 6:15 when I wake up in hotel room that I'm staying in with my cousin for the weekend one cold just for fun at 7 a.m. I had down to the restaurant breakfast which sadly doesn't open until 8 but they vary Conde make me an avocado and Rocket sandwich which I have with a cross on orange juice and some coffee while eating are worried about my terrible posture issue of anterior pelvic tilt on the website nerd Fitness and I decide to sort my life out by buying a set of body fat calipers on Amazon to help me get rid of my belly at 7:45 a.m. I drive over to the hospital or I change scrubs get a hand over from the 19th and head over to the obstetrics water I do my usual saving lives Thing by writing a handful of discharge summary a few prescriptions for medication and reviewing a couple of post nasal patients to make sure they're fine to go hug one of the patients had his section the previous day so I'll check in with her congratulate her on the birth of her first baby and also any outstanding questions that she's got about the operation or the recovery. We chat a bit about exercise and contraception following a C-section and I wish her the very back for a future filled with sleepless nights and the joys of Parenthood by 10:15 old mornings jobs are done so I had to the restaurant for a cheeky latte and a banana I bought down my trusty iPad Pro and start putting the structure of this very video before sorting out some of my eat poop assessments as doctors in every placement we have to do a handful of case-based discussions and get feedback from different members of the team about off of Fulton last year I left this to the last minute so this year I promised myself that I'll get this thing sorted well in advance so I'm not scrambling around directions with a foreign object is rectal orifice at 11:30 I get code to the labor board for very small bits like discussing some discharge medication with the pharmacy and doing a bit more paperwork than a noon I had back to the restaurant to grab some lunch with my junior doctor colleagues at 12:30 review a lady on the label would she's a few days post-delivery and it had some bleeding so I see her examine her abdomen on with one of The Midwives I do a speculum and swabs and send a home with antibiotics and a very best wishes from 2 to 6 p.m. things are pretty busy on both the Obstetrics & the gun mostly with random bits of paperwork but I did get a couple of patients with abnormal blood results need sorting out and a few ladies referred from the emergency department who are review on the Gynecology board and make plans for them that I confirm with the consultant one Cole tell him this runs but does it profit A Day in the Life video that I'm working on in partnership with my hospital where I'll dive into more of the clinical details anyway at 6 p.m. and my own notes and notion on the other side of the screen a huge thank you by the way to notion for sponsoring this video and therefore indirectly funding my hotel stay in Old meals that I had during this weekend if you haven't eaten yet and you are a student or teacher you can actually get notion puzzle play for free by using your edu or AC email address more details in the video description the first thing I do is scope the subject of course that means that I Blitz through the lecture notes and create totals for every subheading so that overall it gives me a big picture idea of what's in Asia then I'm going to election of a 6:30 on there's a reference to something that was discussed in lecture number one because at the end of every paragraph in a lecture notes I'm asking myself firstly does this make sense and secondly could I explain this to a five-year-old I realize that I'm not hungry clear on this point about fluid redistribution across different compartments in the body and that maybe I wouldn't be able to explain it to a five-year-old clearly enough so rather than playing on with this n**** in the back of my mind I go all the way back to lecture 1 and start to build up the story of flu distribution using the Cornell note-taking system and my previous video about how I take notes with notion lots of people wanted to get in-depth look at that so here we go Leslie as I'm going through I'm typing out the main points using language that's as simple as possible but second late because I'm taking notes Cornell method I try and hide every piece of information underneath a question for my future self that means that when I'm reviewing my notes in the future rather than just passively reading stuff which would require a zero brainpower and be completely useless I'll be testing myself on this as a good luck this is active recall and action is the act of testing ourselves and stuff rather than just rereading it and as you'll know if you're a regular viewer of this channel active recall is the single most effective studying techniques that I've been preaching about for the last 2 years but some of the content on topping out it's in my own words again as simply as possible but it's it's typing it out would just take too much time I'm just screenshotting to lecture notes cropping to the relevant bit and then inserting the photo as an image in motion then I'd like to hide images on their own because I don't like images plugging up the main body of my nuts so yeah for example I screenshot this books about van't Hoff equation and I hide it under its own toggle and later on I screenshot this box about stalling depression and again so that it doesn't mess up the what is time at around 6:50 p.m. so I had to the hospital restaurant to drive a super healthy snack of french fries with ketchup and mayonnaise and 20 minutes later and back of the Gynecology Clinic room and back to work I continue my way through lecture 6 but after about 20 minutes already the current levels of brain power motivation and discipline really aren't enough to get through this traffic right now so from 7:35 to 7:45 I procrastinate buy something on the chat with my belly hanging out wishing I could take a nap at 7:45 I got a phone call from a page talking about some blood results so I spend around 20 minutes on the phone explaining this to her and then at 8:05 p.m. I meet with a 19-5 and over there's not a lot going on so the registrar is super nice and lets me leave early and head out of the hospital arriving back at the hotel at 8:45 from 8:45 my cousin and I take a seat in the hotel lounge to continue bashing out some work he's preparing for postgraduate medical exam and recently discovered my study with me playlist on Spotify so he's listening to that while going through practice Quest after ordering a virgin mojito and some proper food I find a second wave of activation energy Within Myself and get back to studying even though Jones doing his own thing the fact that were both studying in the same place helps keep me going when I'm doing what social with both using the Pomodoro Technique at why we work for 25 minutes and then take a five-minute break and repeat the process I don't often use the Pomodoro Technique these days but I find it feel quite helpful for keeping me motivated psych discipline to study when my energy levels up or if I'm working with other people anyway I make install on Nexus 7 but before I started properly again I scoop the subject and just make a quick note of the other elections within the series just to give myself an idea of where we're heading with all this stuff and whether lectures I'm doing at the moment fit into the bigger picture and then when I start actually going through after 7 again I scoped it by turning all of the subheadings into Tuggle's in notion ones that done again I'm just following the basic process of the Cornell note-taking system on topping on the bits that I want to remember all the bits that I need to me Lily insightful and I'm hiding them underneath toggles with questions to force my feet yourself to actively record them later another thing I like to do is convert Pros into numbered list wherever possible so for example in this bit about the different experiment than Vernis did I want my to self to know these off my heart and so I summarize the various paragraphs in the lecture notes into a list of five and a hide them under the total experiments by Vernie but the toggle experiments by bunny wouldn't be too helpful to My Future Self so I add a little hint to remind myself that the five. I need to test myself on this is another important point that I like to keep in mind that when I do take notes on taking them for my future self and because of the way memoryworks I know that my future self is going to forget a load of stuff before I see the notes again until I make it as easy as possible for my feet stuff to maintain good habits like using activity cool and spaced repetition and another side note here you'll see in the lecture notes it says if you put the concentration of ADH secreted against the plasma osmolality will find the slope of the relationship is very Steven to cancel the sensitivity of the response this is way too much of a mouthful rephrase it simply as the osmoregulatory system is super sensitive that phrase super sensitive is way too casual to see in a text book over to write an essay but I find that the same platanal casual I can make my own language while understanding stuff black male betta actually remember it later on and of course I've hit in this bit underneath the question what's the difference in sensitivity between the osmoregulatory system and the baroreceptor Intensive ADH regulation and that question is a promise to My Future Self as usual anyway 20 PM so during the break we chat for a bit we intend for the brakes be 5 minutes but end up chatting for a little bit longer until the second poem session starts at 9:29 nothing much need to adhere really I just finished lecture 7 and make a start on the 8th against bull diving into it at one point I realized my absolute Delight that I can use emojis to represent up and down arrows when typing up physiology processes which wasn't really a thing when I was going through my first year of medical school because back in like 2013 emojis one as well supported stop format they all know what a time to be alive anyway the final point I want to make him this video is that what I'm making us I'm thinking of them almost as a representation of the model that I've got for the subject in my own brain if my notes are very clogged up and so is my thinking on the topic but if my notes unless they categorized and looks simple enough then the concept of my brain will end up being quite simple as well that's one of the reasons why I have to be love the total featuring ocean because it lets me see the big picture and a nice on couch fashion and if I do need to drill down in details of a topic I can hit the toggles and get all the detail I need anyway I'll study session ends at 10 p.m. and we end up chatting for another half an hour while sipping on caffeine free peppermint tea just before bed or trying to do a session of gratitude journaling in my Northtown 1970 notebook but then off seconds I realized I really can't be bothered tonight because I'm absolutely not good so I called it a night ready to get up at 6:15 the next morning for another 13-hour on cool shift so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video goodnight"

            "text": " hello guys welcome back to another episode of the when making an Up Series where Ben and I talk to you about the behind-the-scenes process of building contest as surgical logbook medical students that way building over the next few weeks in today's video we're going to be talking about how to design and hopefully I'll be showing you the business quite a straightforward process that doesn't need to be as complicated as it sometimes seemed to people who haven't done it before on YouTube and around the rest of the internet about the specific apps that we're going to be using for this the point of these videos isn't to give you the nitty-gritty of how to use the app snug click this button pic that watching since I use the pen tool at more about high level overview about right if you've got an idea for an app how do you take the idea into a product and what steps do you need to do how do you go about it you end up doing this. Of course you can find more detail tutorials about how to use sketch or Envision or any of the other things we going to be using anyway which was pretty much the level that we were at we then need to design what we think the app is going to so for contest we just started out with some sketches been spent an afternoon drawing boxes on a page of a piece of A4 paper that we stole from one of the prince of the hospital is like a box of the screen a box for the notebook page 2 books for the Adoration page right on the homepage we want a button that things to look book on the operations page we want to show all the items on the out of operation page we want to book something for them patient ID that's what thing is to put it very very badly just growing boxes page any legit designers what's this video will the field marketing know the design is going to be watching this video of lay people who are not experts in design or anything like that just want to get something from idea into reality designing an app is effectively just bring boxes on a page and we start by doing these by pen and paper and then once we've done that we can transition into converting them into an into a digital copy of the designs so often been spent a few hours with put his pen and paper drawing these books as we had little section while we discuss some of the ideas and suggested some ways in which could be improved and some things that we didn't quite ones anyway the next step was the actual computerized design the app the point is we just need some kind of software for the computers that control boxes on the screen the one that I personally like using the school sketch it's available only for Mac it's a specific web design or after Zayn tool and I think it cost about 40 pounds for the student discount license you can use something called figma figma which is also really good and it's a web-based things you don't have to install anything you can use on Mac and windows for you can even use things like PowerPoint and word because PowerPoint and would let you drop boxes on the page secondly scratch I think a lot of times when people who haven't done this sort of thing before think about designing an app for designing a website they think about the blank screen the blank piece of notepad paper that they're going to have to write a codon and maybe that was true 10-15 years ago when you pick up an HTML book you're my everything out inspecting HTML what he had done all that stuff that's not really true in this day and age in 2017 there were so many good free results is out there. There's very little point in actually starting anything from scratch so although designing an app is just drawing go to page says look look pretty like if you got a text field or if you go to keyboard or if you've got an image it will be nice for it to look like how it would on an iOS device on Android device and luckily there are people on the internet who have given away templates of the boxes for iOS or Android we found one on the internet dragging and dropping the right buttons and the text fields on to a separate document and changing the text of it position whereby you've got your own full-time thing going you just made me want to learn how to design an app as a side project and in that case there's absolutely no need to reinvent the Wheel from scratch ones you can get pay a few pounds of them but they're a little different ones to customize them to suit your needs and then you have something ready to go and in about 2 hours of throwing boxes on sketch and copying and pasting components from this template into our actual document we managed to create a pretty reasonable look hopefully you like it meaning of quite nice and it took a few hours have been drawing bubbles in a piece of paper and then a few hours of me and benefit of collaborating on sketch on a single computer and drawing boxes on this app and hopefully this video. designing an app is not as hard as an initially seems and what you got an idea in your head you just converted into a paper sketch converted into a online document and then you pretty much ready to go so thank you very much we made the screens go from one to the other thank you for watching please give it a thumbs up if you like the video please subscribe if you haven't already I will see you in the next one by"

            "text": " Channel and to probably the penultimate study with me video this video takes place today before our final exams. So I woke up around 9 a.m. struggle to get out of bed for a while when upstairs made my usual breakfast 2 for 3 weeks honey left in the house which means I have to have a week to fix this with just milk and that's not very nice then breakfast replying to your emails a quick plug I have a weekly email newsletter you can always going to reply to it to talk to me if you like and then I thought I should probably stop some work but before doing so I have to clean my room okstate so I spent the morning looking over history taking and systems review so what that means when you told me to Patient on the unit taking the History Channel woke up what's going on with that comes a point where they're not going to say anything more because they said what they want to say and you have to ask him a series of quite close questions like you know do you have any chest pain I'm experiencing shortness of breath have you been having any nausea vomiting kind of stuff that just screams for disappointed about categorization not categorisation is a very magical technique in fact off to space repetition and active recall is probably the third most important exam technique and that is categorizing anything you can whenever you can so for instance be there about eight or nine different questions I need to ask a few things together so that I only have to learn for things rather the night anyway to make sure I remember these happy about this is like a thing that I constantly off myself and I lost myself more and more often as we approach the exam I thought that there was a slight possibility that a sexual health case might come up rather than bullet points in my head I'm constantly making between the various points so I can better remember them if we start by asking them if they have any vaginal discharge then the discharge Q's us to ask about itchiness and not hughes's ask about pay and it does itching worse than that Jesus talks about skin changes around the vagina and if this can change around vagina. Q's to ask did I have any systemic rashes you can see how a list of seven becomes kind of connected together so that you don't need to memorize a list of seven instead you leave things together in a connected way thinking about how I might remember it because I don't trust my memory remember something I wrote down to make I'd be making notes and I'll be thinking that the act of making notes is making stuff going to my brain but that's just like never end up happening but if while making notes you can come makeup Monex you can like make these active links between the different topics of that just increases the number of queues available to recall which increases their kind of encoding of memory which makes memory stronger which means you're more likely to remember in an exam or whatever veginal and penile rashes are we supposed to have lunch I'll see you after break-up spend some time going to various roleplay preparation book I read through the patient history of the patient could have these down on my iPad in a very rough untidy way because the objective is not to make notes here it's to active recall and to remember stuff I want to write stuff down I can like cats stuff down while I'm actively recording surgical rotation as a clinical medical student asking what are the causes of small bowel obstruction listing listing of the closest Mobil destruction but then like one of the one of the registrar I said that there is a phrase categorize or die can you read off list of things they want to hear you categorize them so now if I lost about the cause of the small bowel obstruction I would say that the common causes are adhesions and hernias but other quizzes can be categorized based on the fact that the Bible is Acme block data from the wall or if we block some something in the living like a list of all the various things within those categories that cost mobile instructions if you want to increase your retention of the subjects there's another Point here that might be helpful and tell myself while revising is that I should not trust my memory I'm going back to the point about how writing notes down just I'm just not going to remind me to remember the stuff I've written down. Down I'm making the mics and what I was going through the stuff in the salty preparation book one of the questions that came up was one of the components of a confusion screen I8 if a patient is confused he's out a computer screen is very important to know and I thought it was called a recent exam question that might have come up so I decided they made a reasonable Anthony Monica came up with SCBT MSG go to three letter acronyms of things that we already know what they are so CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy it's a lot easier to remember tvt MSG then is to remember like cmsd TV. if you could probably work out a lot of them from first principles because they are sort of Common Sense and you kind of come across them a bit but if you want to be slick and you want to increase the amount of kids you have available for Rico it's just nice having any more like as an option we read out with a patient presents with and then we have a moment of silence while everyone in the room thinks or write down what the possible diagnosis could be and then we discuss the case I'm kind of work out with the ounces on this way we will get practice and no one is spoon-feeding anyone else so we can all work through number of cases in small amount of time and we can all be practicing active Rico by ourselves because ultimately we are going to be taking this exam by ourselves play everything but I'm pretty confident that I know enough to come to be costing time do I spend the next year I was doing some editing around 7 p.m. we ordered some sushi for dinner is a pre-exam tree and eating it which I oversee most areas talk about what my chem exam tomorrow we want to pick role play another role play so overall off at 5 p.m. it's pretty chill but we still doing a bit of group where I can still quite fun because we getting together but we're still kind of being productive to me from the past what's the night before the exam exam is tomorrow this is the first in outcrop of oskies we got five stations tomorrow for his protection stations and then One charging station facts about it just in my pre-exam shaves I look slightly anemic clean-shaven than usual before the exam but I like to try and do how to tell myself that that feeling in my tummy is excitement rather than fear of stress and there's this thing of it on the internet that said that's like a legit way to hack your brain into thinking that you're having fun rather than absolutely terrified so hopefully I'm going to be seeing this miles off to my exams done and if you're watching this then you probably having times of your own so I'll be smart and gleefully on Instagram story so I'll be finished but if you want all the very best of luck with them already helped you smash them thank you very much watching the video if you like to please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed Channel please consider evening and good luck with your exams"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is Junior doctor working Cambridge and in this video I'm going to be answering questions that you guys are sending for the hundred thousand subscribers but yeah so a few weeks ago I sent as part of my weekly email newsletter I sent a little PostScript asking for people to send in their questions if you don't know I have a weekly email news I said what every Sunday I'll send out an email with a few paragraphs of thoughts for the week like a lingo to die just coming that way short quite readable on a Sunday on Sunday mornings most of the time but as part of that I sent out the school for questions and 50 people when I get through about 25 or 30 of them is it going to be a really really long video so please don't feel like you have to watch all of it I'll put timestamps in the video description and a nap increments you'll be able to just click on the timestamp that has a video that has a question that you interested in how you can just get to that section of video but yeah otherwise it's going to be a fairly Long Beach I ate Q&A let's just jump into it oops that's around the age of 13 and at the time available was very very different sabacc then it was w3schools and I also go to the Viking and macromedia Dreamweaver books and they didn't like DK multimedia books about Flash in HTML that was like the old school way of learning nowadays it's learning how to cook from scratch I would just sign him to a course. You don't need to do once people learn to code in like you know the 2000s who says it's now but yeah name for yourself that you know what every week I want to make one or two videos that's quite it's quite that is not my task for the evening that I have to do nothing just having that setup up front that this is what I'm going to do and it not being a matter of debate it's kind of like my weekly I decided that every single every single Sunday I was going to write this week to email news I said since that time I've not missed a single one because once I set that system for myself it became an optional thing actually I think this is this is probably probably the things that I used to stay productive to by procrastination is having the system I think if I get home and I have so many options of things that I could be doing that is when I stop procrastinating because you know the idea of doing any single one it just too big it's a it's a Thursday today I'm going to make a video cuz I have to make on this week or you know what is the Sunday this is my day for making making my email newsletters or it's a Monday morning I'll go to the gym every Monday morning like when you have that system and then I think that's one way of okay so Alexandra of revision want to keep on top of the old stuff because you know that with spaced repetition of play you know that the more you going to repeat it. I think I'm pretty lucky thing to understand that any 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 minutes of revision work that you do testing yourself and previous content is going to be worth about 3 hours worth you know actual is sitting down reading a book for me personally I've never really found an issue to revise older material ever since I found out that the spaced repetition with a thing because it just makes you live so much like 10 times more efficient when you just take that 5 minutes to text yourself on the previous Celtics but I know that just taking a small amount of time so yeah I think it's just a case of prioritizing it making it part of your routine revise my active Rico questions that I wrote to myself for the previous topic right next week difficult to sustain new good habits Joba what else to being in school full-time a matter of motivation motivation what you need to discipline and I think that really changed the game for me when I discovered a few years ago. Motivation is just a temporary feeding of I feel like doing something where a discipline is a permanent thing of that tells me that you know what's a good thing to practice guitar turn on the couch and listen to the music or I just want a unibrow YouTube for 8 hours and go through and check on these two conflicting sides of a tease myself what is recognizing that you brought these two conflicting things on a just let you know just simply recognizing that means that you can decide to that I've got home at 6 p.m. I need to sleep at 11 p.m. so I was a time my three-year-old self wants me to slap Instagram and Facebook five hours but instead I'm going to override my three year olds motivate myself to do other things outside of medicine because pretty much everything camera and it's over always quite a fun thing goes like I'm learning piano guitar music theory I just enjoy that stuff so much that I don't need to motivate myself to do it I think anybody comes into it when you're trying to motivate yourself to do something that's inherently unpleasant I found that back when I have to motivate myself to go to the gym it was a lot harder where is when I developed a system that made me enjoy the gym a lot more I eat having a workout that would just decided to me in advance where I didn't have to do anything and then listening to I think that you enjoyed them find a way to make them fun that's how I met you make myself to do extra things outside of Medicine it's really more about quantity than it is about quality at the start and I've written a blog post about some a website with a link here I also had this was one of the one of the topics of My Weekly Newsletter anyway whatever it was Casey neistat and analyzing their started meditating so then working that into my own videos on YouTube the news of stupid just doing it and you can find stuff on the internet that helps you do it going to sound like I'm an absolute but I'm going to share my thoughts about this anyway I think one life more said that I like to follow is afraid so hard can it be under the phrase from like Steve Jobs or someone that everything in the world around you is made by people who are no snow you know what if I want to do something then I'll do it myself doing various things within medicine how long can it be doing anything else on the side how can it be other people have done it then I think that is a muscle that has really helped me to the point where I like I can't remember the last time I had anything like a moment of self-doubt because if you want it how hot can it be people that I can just message I will actively seek them out and try to learn from them like even the weird things like weird things like there's a few doctors that I work with will that really funny and you know I actively ask them how they make the jokes and normally they don't like you never responded very kind of algorithmic way way like I want to but humor and then you know I read books on the Harbour have to be funny or cuz I wanted to improve my sense of humor so I think it's just having an attitude of being willing to learn even if the things that we would normally considered weird like humor or social skills Israel things that are absolutely loanable on that you can learn to resources like the internet and books and by putting them into practice but yeah the Aromas that changed our lives call to years or so but I think how I discovered this book when I was in secondary school or at my audit ages University it would have really helped what's the best book you read this year akeso and I really can't say which one is the best I enjoyed them all equally Sam mistborn kingkiller Chronicles and Stormlight Archive I'm just going to put those in the top three things that I've read this year play make it fun so I was a big fan of studying with friends enjoy studying would like epic instrumental music in the background or link my Spotify study with me playlist we need to motivate myself to do it cuz it's fun and we don't need to motivate yourself to do things that are fun audience would like to know something about your private life all right next to you really didn't enjoy I think obviously I did already used to attend many lecture than first and second-year I sort of wish that I had attended a bit more but then I also think that I would have taken it again cuz I was throwing that morning will from chilling with my friends before giving up return for attending a few extra Lexus IS despite not enjoying every hundred percent moment going to be absolutely terrible and that's okay because no one really cares what are the Bible that people are going to talk to me DVD is going to crap will change as you continue the time I imagine my whole sell-by date we're not really going to care about watching someone and still studying I think I want to go down the Avenue of medical education for once so medical students and doctors subscribe to this like mini weekly article and I want to keep that going for as long as I can every single week self-improvement life advice motivation productivity hacks music videos Caswell cycle around me and it's nice being a sort of YouTuber that I can expect to continue so yeah that's how I think my contact will change some of that will stay the same maybe I want to go a lot more into this medical education think so relationships in medical school I think Ashley might not actually be a medical student it's kind of strange and because the whole medical State medical school is so hard you have to work all the time that whole Mantra I have not really heard very much from actual medical students I've only really hurt medical applicants who have been sold this Vision that med student I'm at school at the hottest thing ever we had a specially if you can use efficient study techniques you know things other than just pouring over text summarizing you really care about this other stuff you can do stuff like that then you will study become so much more efficient and therefore you never have to do this whole thing of time it's bedtime easy to form quite meaningful relationships with people in Mexico and temperature is work together with friends together bring people together patient says I have just one question do you know of any scientific ways to beat procrastination conseil I do I have already checked but those two things that I mentioned I was at number one enjoying what you do and number to recognizing that you are in control of it on that disk what modern nation is how I would recommend beating procrastination make it fun make it easy to build good habits canceling that down below as well James Clear Atomic habits I think there are any ostensibly useless activities that have a hidden purpose because like something especially given the amount of advice that's around there in the world something like meditation I suppose sitting there just letting you know is a good thing so it's no longer in a sentence that uses activity we've all heard about the benefits of meditation and yet so if you'd be so few people do it so you think of anything that is apparent that does have a hidden benefit at this point I would have mentioned a quote from ShayCarl I think he said something like the secrets of Life are hidden behind the word cliche cliche you should stop and think for a moment best advice is the shade definition do you have any advice conceptually difficult is just a case of effective efficiently remembering an understanding all the stuff so something to you and once you've understood something that isn't the case of remembering it and that involves using State reputation an active recall the most efficient study techniques you better in Mexico from Myanmar he says avoid being seen as a perfectionist I think this idea of how do we how do we put ourselves out there without being too light with without being too worried bespoke foolish that we all have to some degree of fear the other people are going to think that we're fools for putting a head up an electron saying something and I'll sing a silly question or for speaking out and we will have this fear judge me as being an idiot therefore I'm not going to do it Tim Urban wait but why has already been out the cold cold taming the monkey mind to avoid putting ourselves out there to avoid being seen as the weird one in the group because if you were seen as the weird one of your Pokemon group then no one want to make it with you and your jeans would be passed on but we're no longer in a society what that's a useful thing it's very it becomes very maladaptive when we have this constant fear that I have to look perfect a little time I can't run the risk of looking like a fool because it comes back to the caveman thing but it's I'm not being the ego ego is the enemy of about this concept about how to attach to our own egos on the bad thing so those two are yellow and stops you can check those out that might hopefully help Isabella from Brazil show me how to collect blood of tiny babies but before 1 hour ago he told me to collect the blood sample by myself without him to talk me through the process results are tried and failed this made me feel completely miserable for calling the baby pain especially because it was an experience have you ever been to something like that when you hunt or quotes pain to a patient because of your inexperience or lack of skills and how do you deal with it where I have damage to Patient probably cause damage to a patient I've been in this example not into a patient but we'll see a lot more serious than just an experience Odette to a patient and this is kind of hard to understand that's happened I've ended up experience is something that comes by definition of experience and what time and when you OD on the process when you're a medical student like Isabel is or when you are an F1 Junior doctor to operate on the level data consultant would know that someone with much more experience with so I think even in situations where it is like it is important to retain this growth mindset and recognize that I've learned from the experience and I did the best I could I can't do anything about that I'm going to use this as an opportunity to try and grow and improve my skills so I can tell yeah you're young you need to learn somewhere and I think this kind of reminding yourself that any pain you posted this baby is ultimately pain that will help you develop as a better doctor and therefore will help save more lives for the underlined so anyway you do developer this utilitarian approach of short-term pain for one patient means long-term gain for other people that you treat I think that's the way maybe to look at it but I'm still quite new to this whole thing but how do you deal with how do you deal with feeling like you never adequate pretty tough I know a lot of other people deal with tips for feeling of inadequacy as well as well as you are then we can have this body on our heads that other people know what they're doing but maybe no one has any other has come down to a thing about you overtime that you don't care if I'm if I'm about it something cuz I know that it's just a learning process and I think that's really the key to avoid that just making it up as I go along every single YouTuber you think is successful is just making it up as I go along the same as any field there's a famous graduation where he was supposed to question that how many people in this room in the faculty have felt at some point in the last week that they're just making it up and every single person for the heads up so don't worry about it if you just wing it cuz everyone is fine please because I send out an email every single Sunday without fail and it's not an option I have to do it on Sunday medical student was optional that much but now I have to go to work at 4 if you want to develop more just make make yourself write 200 words a day or like right the block party every week or Verizon email every two days as long as you have a system and it's not an option then you'll make yourself do it actually but it's nothing special, but you feel better about your vessel register about you sit down and you do the right thing if you want to maintain and one of the top books that influenced you the most explosion in popularity with an incredible favorite blogs I'll be like Mark Manson. Net based around his blog post Personal Finance in frugal living and stuff I love driving through that as well next question but with me every passing year I feel like I'm not growing on just forming more bad habits how do you grow Everyday by having good habits by setting up good systems that mean that you are improving incrementally every single day this read James Clear Atomic habits habits are the compound interest of life good habits then they compound in a nice way over time why does he have bad habit that compound in a bad way over time so that the key is to do to develop good habits about the four. Framework to developing good habits so check that out so much time we don't need to work that much outside of Mexico today he's been to them with friends or once or twice a week you use that $5 to do other things on the side this is so much time and actually you know we have more time to do other stuff with it I think it was about making other things a priority so for me when I was in med school what was the lowest party thing like I had a deadline coming up I want to do well and make sure my schoolwork and homework on time. I barely have any time for myself again telling you that much if they are the matter you do it anyway and then you still have like for the day like at school you have more time than you will ever have again in your life if you find that you're in a leveled and you're not getting enough time for yourself you definitely doing something wrong in terms of studying efficiently you're probably spending a lot of time you know carrying around big leader artbound binders of chemistry notes and going from highlighting and making your own notes no reason you're probably using very inefficient if you're not finding yourself with enough time and enough time to do other things who cares about keeping on top of school bus only offered to do my school work am I allowed to get myself time to myself there's a concept in investing and like saving my personal finance. Is yourself first like as soon as you get a paycheck 50% of that paycheck and put into a savings or investment account you pay yourself first and then build and groceries and everything else can people with the rest of the money I think it's kind of the same with time you pay yourself first because that's the most important thing again tomorrow so yeah I'm just going to end this over here remaining 15 or so questions then let me know in the comments and I'll do another one of these like white enjoy doing this videos thank you very much if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed stuff every Sunday video and I'll see you in the next one"

Still going to be sure you tell us a joke and we met about six months ago we we we we go together about six months ago so that was kind of in the middle of medical school from Rouen feitas I think if you had the chance to go back in time and change something but we changed for me nothing cuz Butterfly Effects you know where you change something the policy changes everything the future then bad things happen so pretty five or six different people asked what would you have studied at not medicine and where would you have gone to Cambridge so I was but then I decided that even though I really enjoyed computers and coding and that sort of stuff like I would have enjoyed it more as a hobby rather than his job and I'm quite proud of myself for this but I had the foresight you know 10 years ago when I was and become a legit like programmer but I'm a doctor at the same time I think that's more marketable more interesting than someone who just a programmer or someone who just to talk to so I thought that and if I can get to Cambridge Idaho from Imperial somatic on there yeah do you wish you ever went somewhere else know I'll have to be loved in Cambridge I probably won't live here forever it's absolutely the best that boy and paid-up something says were you born in the UK or just immigrated just left there for about 2 years and southern Africa a country called Lucy to live there for about 5 years then moved was doing the exam the international people have to take to get his medicine in the UK so we live in Pakistan for another year between like ages 6 and 7 or something of that and then we move to the UK and since 2003 so it's been about 15 years now which is pretty cool next question is I expired account what type of medical student were you in your I think every year I kind of become more I go to university I wanted to tell trying to put myself out there a bit more and I think I'm really glad to have done that and I've been doing that every year since so pretty I guess like developing my confidence I'm now I now feel when was your anxiety about stuff like public speaking and like asking questions and answering questions in class and stuff like that stuff that I would have had an issue with back in the day Within Myself a little bit more self-awareness as well I mean I've been rejected from a few things I applied to go to Harvard four-year rejected apply to the academic Foundation program rejected if you wait to take lots of shots and some of them some of them on but either way you're still kind of you're still playing the game a house as is your favorite movie still in chanted second-favorite Tangled and Sean to the store quiet fire up there with your favorite book is bowtie pasta still top of the list but fall in love with the kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick rothfuss the Name of the Wind and the wise man's fear I make if you quit so please sign up for a free trial of audible pretty good I subscribe every month to pay my seventh grade and you just listen to audiobooks on 287 amazing wait upon the time and subscribe I have a question to open to the leaving it I thought about this I thought about answering this about religion because I get that when you have kind of a platform like I seem to have had then you are like the stuff you say can influence people and I'd already want my thoughts on religion influence anyone because I don't really already looked enough into it to feel qualified to comment on it and it's such a big deal and it's all tied up with family and everything else. I got to come in about religion would probably so the first question comes from jroa 1291 he says how many more years of schooling do you have left of what you want to specialize in so I've left medical school now and I want a special I think I want to specialize in Obstetrics & Gynecology what you want to specialize in Obstetrics & Gynecology is what that was my favorite place in the medical school and I think that's what I want to do but I'm more than open to changing my mind I know it's stressful everyone over uses of wood special Too Much Life as a medical student for me at least wasn't particularly stressful but I think whether something is stressful or not depends more on how you deal with stress and how you how you cope with it personally rather than what the thing is abject I wouldn't say no to have an easy life off University easy is probably another what any doctor would use to describe it but you know some of them would describe as stressful as some of them would say it's not that bad I think you're very very depending on what you are like as a person free time during the day yeah you got brakes so you're supposed to have every 4 hours that you work you're supposed to have a half an hour break if you work an 8-hour shift which is done to date you have like an hour break for lunch or whatever if you work a 12-hour shift if you're supposed to have your hour lunch another half an hour break at some point I'd also like some days that's just stuff to do like all the time but I do to the time you have another downtime you have been upon to wear your work colleagues in the doctor's office but there is a bad time 50 Cent or how's it going down because of what happened with the NHS was pretty decent like an F1 me and most of my friends are running between about 30034 thousand a year free tax service but you know that's not really what we signed up for I think I've but I have done what about this about more more for the answer what was life like in the first day but it's just that it was it was busy mistakes but it sold like a Lennox and that the colleagues really nice and everyone seemed quite supportive you have issues with what Kool-Aid sometimes you know you need to be nice to patients even though I don't really see the challenges of being a doctor as something that I need to overly concern myself with if that was one thing that would make you quit being a doctor what would it be would be if I didn't ultimately enjoy it I think with any kind of job you can't really like how it's it's it's never going to be like flowers and roses on the time that you don't enjoy 70 bits of it. I really don't enjoy even though running around businesses seen as Holy Grail of all that's a dream I think if overall I never the point where for an extended. Of time like weeks or months 3 months I'm thinking that right I'm really not enjoying my job and there's nothing I can do to change that and do nothing within myself that I can do to make myself enjoy it more then that would be the time where about I would consider quitting because thankfully I do have other options other than medicine of the YouTube channel now if they're running my business I'm I do tekton design and putting on the side so I've got all these various things I could be doing instead of being adopted a today so a lot of people are in a position and I'm very fortunate to be in that position so my thing of putting the doctor wouldn't even be if I find it not enjoyable anymore talk about like life of a junior doctor I don't think I've been that many important takeaways has been fed around late but hey it's a Q&A celebrating 50 thousand subscribers if you have a good night"

            "text": " alright so today is what it was going to be about as mechanical keyboard I was going to be like a big review about this mechanical keyboard that has been using about the sound of the switches and stuff but it just felt a little bit weird and so instead I'm going to chat Five Lessons that I've learned about racism over the years and recently Morrison and trying to educate myself about it a little more and more number one is the idea of perfectionism like a lot of people I know it would have very strong feelings about racism but a lot of people it would feel really weird about talking about it because we're not educated enough business it's it's one of those excuses that a lot of people use for not talking about political or Humanity she's because they think well I'm not really qualified soak about this I'm not an expert in the field race or whatever the the topic would be and that was a big part of why I wasn't going to do this video I was thinking that instant I was little business as usual with the boys out there like what can I really on to the next I'm not an expert on the topic at all but to be honest I'm running about me and white supremacy and in it it talks about this idea of perfectionism as being a very standard excuse as to why people you don't do anything about racism about white supremacy about this sort of stuff and I think for me on my on my YouTube channel I am totally okay with making videos about stuff that on North next I don't pretend to be next to anything. Talk about a review Microsoft Surface tablet whatever it's cold without me and I haven't used windows for 10 years but for some reason when it comes to the issue of race I would feel like I need to know more about thing is becoming extra into staying until I can I can talk about it I don't think that's going to be us by anyway it's sort of like trying to find a perfect workout plan I'm trying to research everything about nutrition before we start even going to the chat like that 18 all the way to go about it and always think we do need to educate ourselves about about also suffix including race but I don't think not being an extra in it is a reason to not talk about it and I know that there are so many people who I am who I'm friends with 101 I'm told about the dishes for fear that they would get it wrong with it would offend someone or it would get canceled or they don't supposed to have the right to listen to and another reason what's obvious to you can be amazing. this is a philosophy that I've it's paused for a long time I haven't give protiviti voice over the internet and it's stuff that very obvious to me because I've been in a reading about productivity for like a decade and yet if it's the first time or the second time that someone has come across idea of Parkinson's lower the parable of the Mexican fisherman or whatever then there's can be kind of genuinely game-changing life-changing insights that were obvious to me but potentially amazing to other people a lot of friends who were really deep into the kind of block method minority activism in that sort of stuff and so I had lost conversations with them about things like race and gender issues and back in the day I used to be a little bit annoyed by these these friends of mine the words for example make Biden comment about white people and I would say stuff like hey look guys you know you're complaining about racism and stuff but you'll being racist to these white people and they would explain another play racism that has to be a systemic inequality a systemic power imbalance with his attitude and Prejudice and so in most societies you can't be racist towards white people you can be prejudiced but this power that I make is not subjugate white people where is a white person being racist to black person that is prejudiced plus a power Dynamic and therefore that makes it racism the first time I came across the idea I was like suddenly makes a lot of things make sense and I was still a little bit starting come inside with that friend of mine would make towards white people I understood that that's not racism and I first came across this idea in 2014 when a friend of mine explained it just yesterday actually I was talking to a friend of mine who is also a doctor he's from an ethnic minority background and he was using that same Pokemon he was saying that hey look you know I get that black lives matter and stuff but like on black people and Asian people racist against white people even though this this dude has like a lot of black friends and is an ethnic minority and to the doctor at the station to me that's what's obvious to us can be amazing for this like the first time you come up with this idea was in the fact that I explain it to him a WhatsApp and if I hadn't done that and then that inside when it happened and so partly the reason why I'm making a video like this is because that may well be some people watching you haven't come across the idea of the five you call me racist towards white people have often wondered that not taking the steps to find out more about it and that is why I think it is helpful the more people pile on this other I don't want to repost this thing because people will think that I'm just virtue signaling because I haven't talked about this topic in the past before I haven't experienced over racism myself personally and if I post something about black lives matter if I post that repost something on Instagram or whatever people will think I'm just putting on the bed while going to go to signal I get that fear and that was a big fear made before going to making the video that what if people just so to think about I'm by Jessica Lange but the point is it doesn't actually like even if there is one person in the world who comes across an idea through you sharing something about black lives matter or about race or about gender about about anything ready even if it's one person in the world who's Monica changed as a result of that or who takes a small step to find out more that is totally worth the personal I'm scared of what people will think because people will think I'm just a on Africa Allied Bridges and whatever crazy want to use to worry about that. Notes number three is about self education so again when I was and I would get a little bit annoyed because we be having these conversations at some point they would check out the conversation that would say I'm not interested in having this discussion with you I don't want to explain it to you I'd be you like choosing not engage Beyond this like come on like giving that you are the one campaigning for I don't know that having a curriculum that's more based on blacksmithing minority people rather than going to all these race and gender issues you should be the one sitting active interested in explaining it to me as I read myself it is not other people's job to educate us like the people who experience and lift through racism is and stuff on a daily basis have enough on their plates are there isn't enough emotional baggage associated with having to continue Behavior because you're black every time you leave the house is enough emotional baggage associated with that that the people who through that every day they don't need another source of emotional baggage in the life of trying to explain to a skeptic who might be like oh well are you sure that was really racist and I'm pretty sure you would have said that even if you were gone I'm embarrassed to say this is my son to words this little stuff up until quite recently that's a lesson with raised is coming as someone who benefits from male privilege sis privilege straight privilege I can generally positive whites in certain circumstances I have a very much sound like a Porsche white boy I benefit from so many of these systemic inequalities that is you know me to say that it's my friend if black friends job to educate me about racism is a compliment about racism being the one benefiting from the privilege and productivity of happiness all this kind of stuff to learn more about it but for some reason in the field of racism and sexism the stuff I'd thought that while it's someone else's job to educate me I don't need to activate find out more about this myself I think that's one of the main points that everyone is what about by reposting Instagram with your fantastic which is that there are so many things that we can do to educate ourselves about these issues and we absolutely should so give me a few days ago still treating me and white supremacy which is very good next on my list is why I'm not talkin to why why I'm no longer talking to white people about race which I've heard good things about as well and watching videos and reading Instagram post stuff like all of these things are self educational things that we can we shouldn't be relying or expecting a friends who are experiencing this sort of systemic oppression subjugation racism sexism we should be relying on them to educate us about these issues is not that job they didn't the going off on that site it's all cells about those things about to listen to Life appreciate that's the number for is the idea of tone policing again when I was with friends about sex in about race I'll get annoyed by the fact that they were getting angry or shouting or even sometimes crying about these issues that they were experiencing and my view of that the time was lucky know why do we have to bring emotion into this why do we have to serve feel so strongly about it why can we just have a nautical discussion and Analysis of exactly why you do that thing that you experience with a microaggression was race racism because I like no one is doing the stuff from a place of malice like it wasn't you know your experience doesn't count unless you can recall it law to claim without any emotion but what I what I was doing was tone policing and this is one of the chapters in in me and white supremacy it's just a 3 out of 30 is when you recognize all the different us tone policing and why that is such a through white privilege white supremacy way of looking at it it's a saying to these people that you know the the contents of what you're saying matters send it to him that you're using and I want you to use a tone that is unoffensive to me because only then will I engage with these issues and terrorism examples of tone policing from the book so I wish you would say what you're saying and nice away I contact him what you're telling me about you lived experiences because you sound angry your tone is too aggressive the language you using to talk about your little experience is making me feel ashamed along with you using to talk about you lived experiences hateful or divisive you should address white people in the most civil way if you want us to join your cause the way you're talking about this issue is not productive calm down then maybe I would want to listen to you you bringing too much negativity into the space and you should focus on the positive and say that if you experienced an act of violence and then someone else you to recount the active nothing that you experience and yeah it would be completely inhumane for them to expect that you don't have any kind of emotional feelings about this that you're not going to bring emotional feelings into that he says again for the book this is Katie inhumane to be human is to feel to talk paint without expressing pain is to expect a human to record information like a robust when you insist that black and indigenous people of color talk about that painful experiences with racism without expressing any pain Rachel grief you are asking them to dehumanize themselves tone policing is the request that black indigenous people color share our experiences about racism without sharing and you've all real emotions about it and for us to exist in ways that do not make white people feel uncomfortable all of the different examples of tone policing that I've used over the years instead of expecting my friends Ted talk about issues that they're experiencing with expressing emotions because some reason I thought that was the way to go about it so that was kind of lesson before meeting at this tone policing stuff is so if you find yourself doing 10 police England. Stop talk about is about what entering and I sort of known as it's a thing for wildlife we get these again every year in the Oscars Oscars so why it's like you know the the under-representation of black and minority ethnic groups in Hollywood and business and maybe I know so it's a different name when something is white it's kind of seen as the default to point we don't even think about it like the example given the book is Imagine listening to where most of the guests are black or minorities you might ask right label ask I wonder if this podcast is ready for me because of the guests of black and minority coming across the podcast where most of the guests the white even if you're the sort of maybe this podcast isn't for me because all the guess what just would not even cross our minds it is just seen as such a such a default the the white way is like the right way the default way it's just it's just such an intrinsic baked and diesel into a system that we just wouldn't wouldn't even think to consider it you know like if a black woman art book about a white person you know whether these characters was like on the Harry Potter we would never think I wonder this book is to me and yet if 1 people are reading a book about a black lead character they would think her I wonder if this book is ready for me what is a document for me or if it's just kind of pandering to the proud of whatever Supremacy she quotes an example of of an author who writes a lot of books kind of focused around the block characters and how in interviews with journalists hospital when are you going to stop writing books that are about race and should be like I'm not going to like one of my AIMS in life is to make it to that my work does not penned it to the white gaze and white othas like Leo Tolstoy wrote books about white people does books were about race but because we don't Society of the whole we don't see why she's being a race we just don't even considered books about like books folks around whiteness as as being a being about race we only think of no more things as being about race so if someone writes a book where a black person is the central character we would be like this is book about rice that's something that I am try to be more mindful of in terms of the stuff that I read watch listen to looking at Mike a list of podcast that I subscribe to it so basically white men talking to other white men so trying to work on that one pick up over the years and more recently about racism like I said I'm not in the slightest but on front of it, which case without it if you wondering what you can do then I'll put lotto results of Nevada description I've heard good things about that that's next on my to-read list and yeah what's next to the end of this video is that if even one person picks up a book anti-racism more about racism. They won't have before then that'll be done in a few days will return to regular programming with"

            "text": " took for a long time I used to think that goals were a bit pointless what is the point of setting a goal if we can control the outcome and we're just going to be unhappy until we hit the goal and then we can just forget about gold here and now but I'm pleased to say that I was absolutely wrong about this and so in this video I'm going to break down why are used to think that goes are pointless how I know approach setting goals and how I'm not thinking of goals moving forward in terms of setting goals for the new year Paul one forget goals focus on the system instead this YouTube channel for example I've never really had any goals for it like I could care less how many subscribers I have or how many views I get because all those things are outside of my control and at the stoics would say there's no point in worrying about something that is outside of your control all of a sudden subscribe account or Sunday account was more important than the goal was actually the system to getting there so my system was of just I want to release at least one two three videos every week without fail and that's the only thing that I care about this is he says that if you want better results than forget about setting goals focus on your system instead for example if my goal is to get absolutely Hench and become a gymshark athlete then just having that goal is it really important what's more important is the system the process of working out every eating healthfully that taking steroids and this too many issues that I've got with setting goals the first is that they encourage us to focus too much on the destination and not enough on the journey and I'm a big believer of Journey before destination has Brandon Sanderson Jose and secondly goals happiness in a way because when we set a goal when we're making the simplest a contract with ourselves which is that once I reach this goal then I will be happy and that means that way constantly attaching a personal happiness to these goals and so if we hit the golden we just get happiness movie you set another goal and if we don't have to go then we'll be unhappy because we didn't hit the Gulf side because of all these reasons until recently I'd come to the conclusion that the cake goes Arabic Point that's that's screw the goals and just focus on the systems instead but I was wrong about this and actually in doing my Dive live stream interviews with lots of cool people over the last few months I have started to change my mind about the gold thing talk to how to actually think about goals one the goal is the compass what's the direction the goal is the compass at the same time ago by itself is it anything you need a system in process to get there it's you need both of them at the end of the day but the goal is where you trying to get its it makes no sense to try to say one is better than the other they were complimentary they're perfectly intend up that was August Bradley who I interviewed in September and he's an expert on systems thinking he says that yes systems already imported without a goal we don't really have a direction that we're going to a gold doesn't have to be a traditional smart goal goal doesn't have to be a traditional go like a girl could be I just want to be more relaxed in my life I want to reduce my stress level distance with no schedules on nothing scheduled on my calendar could be a goal it could be you can pick the girl you want like any goal is about a goal if it's what matters to you so if you just want to chill life hip technically traditionally was supposed to think of gold a specific measurable achievable real estate Time Bandits and all that stuff but what is the saying is that you don't have to think about him in that way a goal of having a peaceful life 3 we all have goals even if we're not articulating them this way August called me out on my BS when I said to him that well August I already think I'm going to goals first of all I suspect I don't know you that well but I suspect you have some goals you just have an articulated want clearly you're hard-working ambitious person building interesting things that that doesn't happen randomly by accident like what I built a million plus YouTube channel how that happened it's helpful to be explicit and intentional about them I think I don't believe you don't have goals I do believe you might not have Clarity on the road I do believe that they're not in you it was a really good point like I could convince myself that I didn't have goals but actually it was probably a failure of my imagination I'll take it at the Gold so I did have for all our behavior is outcome-oriented biology conversation which might be just the outcome is for us to learn from each other or it might be to produce this video every human behaviors to produce an end in psychologist called prospection the basically prospection is the idea that the thing that makes his conscious human beings is that we can imagine a future answer me when I say that I don't really have any goals to my YouTube channel because I don't care about the numbers I just want to upload 1203 videos week Ben Hardy is saying that is actually gold itself everything in my opinion even if you don't want to call them goals you're getting up to produce YouTube videos in my opinion more exciting about that is the idea that you get to choose the future that directs your present and that's called living consciously be honest about what you want I get the idea that goes can be limiting but the ideas is that everything you do is to create an outcome anyways until why don't you just be honest about what the outcome is do you want this is what I want is what I'm going for it's okay if I don't it don't mean you can do whatever you want logically to make yourself feel better if you either achieve it or don't but the point is to be honest and blunt that motivation is a lot more easily created if you're clear about the outcome when you want and if your explicit about it and flow is a lot easier if you're just if you just poke one thing at a time I think a whole argument against goals goes against human nature to be fully honest with you with gold at this niggling feeling that if you set a goal then you just unhappy until you hit it like my goal is to be choosing to be happy because of the fact that I'm not yet a gymshark athlete but when I said this to Ben he again called me out on my BS because this is totally wrong six goals don't have to make you unhappy in my major goal is to sell millions of copies of this book but that does not make me unhappy and and actually Dan Sullivan has a antidote for this as well because it measure the game not the Gap and it's an ebook I'd recommend everyone read it's free he gives it away but basically says rather than yourself against your ideal you measure yourself against your former self you measure yourself against where you were so if you measured yourself against where you were 3 months ago you probably have made progress towards whatever goal you've made and if you're measuring yourself against your former self rather than your future self then you're always going to be recognizing progress you're always going to be feeling seven goals give you purpose this is one of the key ideas in Man's Search for meaning which of the book written by dr. Viktor Frankl who was a psychiatrist who was in the concentration camps and survived and he wrote about the experience of his life and the life of his friends in the stretching comes in World War that he figured out is that if we don't have a purpose towards a future like if we're not striving for certain goals then our present doesn't have any meaning either he said that what man needs is not a tensionless state but of striving and struggling for what bought three yin and yang so after all that I realized I was wrong about goals I used to think that if you set a goal you're going to be unhappy in the present and if you had to go then what I've done if you don't have to go then you can be sad about it but now I realize that goes are actually useful for and it's really about the yin and yang balance between self-improvement and self-acceptance like it's totally okay for me to be fully satisfied with my life right now which I am but at the same time having a goal of becoming a gymshark athlete or whatever 2 States of self-improvement and self-acceptance we don't have to resolve it and apparently this is one of the key differences between eastern and western styles of thinking like in the west we are very keen to have a logical conclusion to every point and this is how I definitely think where it's like okay well how do I reconcile this idea that on the one hand goes our kind of legit but on the other hand I want to be happy with where I am and I used to think that I had to resolve this conundrum if we think about it more like yin and yang is like a party Eastern philosopher that he's something of the think about it it's like on the one you've got self-improvement on the other hand you got self-acceptance and the two can coexist in Harmony and it's really just about navigating a balance of the tooth rather than trying to solve the equation and come to the bottom of it also moving forward I am definitely trying to set goals New Year in terms of having best self-improvement aspect so I want to become a gymshark athlete I would have trained in emergency medicine and maybe work abroad outside of the UK I want to get married and have full kids probably not this year but maybe at some point but the point is the old lady's goals are just directions you want to hit them then yes the systems and the habits are what is important but if I don't have the gold that I don't have a direction to go in in the first place if one of my goals for the new year is to understand a lot more about how computer science works not when I was applying to University I was to between a pint of medicine and applying for computer science medicine in the end which was actually a great decision and one that I don't regret but I still like computer science I don't want to take it a bit more seriously computer science the goal and the system is going to help me get there by taking online courses Gary Condit sponsoring this video is a fantastic platform for online courses on math science and computer science that causes a fun interactive and engaging and the teach stuff and ready first principles way the really helps you understand what's going on these days I'm taking cryptocurrency switch build it up from the ground up and teaches you about things like cryptographic signatures and how this sort of stuff applies to currency like Bitcoin and actually I lost about mangoes 30,000 lb in 2017 on bitcoin and I'm hoping. just make that mistake again because now I have to want to understanding how Bitcoin actually what it's like me you wasn't interested in learning how to code then bring it has a fantastic introductory and advanced course on python which is the world's most popular programming language our Collective knowledge and understanding of math science and computer science Concepts and head over to bring into Old.

Shift first time breaking bad news this day today what goes on as a doctor in the UK I think you'll be staying so I'll be making videos about Oswego long before that however I still got about five or six blocks maybe even more from my time as a medical student and this is all quite exciting stuff for free to present at a conference and went to Bali as a trip to Grenada there with my family and the graduation stuff the graduation ball graduation day so there is going to be like a time lag between stuff that happens on the channel of localized and stuff that happens in real life when something actually happened because now that I'm going to be stopping at the doctor I do have to be very very careful of confidentiality and professionalism in all this stuff that goes into being a doctor and being like a trusted health professional so yeah but hopefully we should be uploading a regular rights our fingers crossed educational stuff Ames specifically now expanded to look Beyond just medical students but still that was one of the cotyledons that is where I feel I can genuinely add the most value because I filmed so many videos interviewing me and a lot of my friends about how to survive medical school stuff like you know if you have time publication probably do one of those seven day of the week so that if you know you just don't have to watch the video every Monday cuz it'll be pretty irrelevant to you on the educational side I still do have a few things I want to say about general study tips which would apply to that University and secondary school students productivity tips and morning routines and sleeping all this other stuff that goes into being a healthy and happy and productive students toward any kind of learner generally served very well and I've enjoyed making a similar things like that so far gone for maybe some videos about productivity apps that I use in my iPhone iPad and MacBook, Big Apple Fanboy or stuff that Bridges this education and detects fear videos reviews of stuff that I've been using for ages. I think I have an interesting perspective on I don't think I'd be very good at just reviewing check with benchmarks and all the stuff that good life adult to life of productivity I think I'll be able to offer something fresh may be unique in terms of reviews does that is going to be another strand of stuff on this channel what to focus out on everyone says that we should be focusing down on one particular thing but I am going to ignore that advice I'm going to be making really nice videos for medical students Altec about how use iMac goes stuff like that about adult life I filmed loads about moving into this house and sitting at my desk and going to do a new desk setup video cuz I was really fun to do in general this stuff that I think will help you out of blocks of what it's like to now being adults to now be a doctor working in the UK coming on YouTube I do still try to reply to every Instagram DM so feel free to message me on their list of videos to make on this new after I discovered cool things to talk about I'm hopefully going to be making as life progresses over the next year or so and so because I haven't done a monthly favorite video for this month and I kind of feel bad about that I'm just going to do a quick monthly favorites thing Bill's furniture on second day I've been listening to the wise man's fear which is the second book of The kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick rothfuss affordable and if you do I get like to quit commission so been focusing on getting stuff for this house I've been doing is I've just my filmed and edited like a 75 + video series about how to do well in the beam at which is the by medical emissions test I've been running and been teaching students in physical classrooms across the UK and Singapore the Netherlands about how to do well on this exam so because I am now going to be a doctor and don't really have time to teach in person anymore I put every single thing I know online into this online video course yes it will cost money I'm afraid but it'll be free of charge to anyone from my any other financial difficulties anything but yeah that has been kind of taking up my life for the last 2 weeks and now that's all finished so hopefully bugs coming your way and more I'm saying thank you it's just been an incredible experience and yeah I'm just kind of folding up all of my old Abilify projects time seems to be kind and quite well"

            "text": " finally a medical student at Cambridge University and today we're going to be comparing the iPad Pro with the normal iPad specifically the handling of the apple pencil almost pacifically if you're a student whether you should buy the iPad Pro or the iPad to answer this question early today my friend Charlotte came over she has the 2018 iPad and I have the iPad Pro and we found ourselves making notes only cuz I pads to see if we could tell what the difference was between the two that whenever what comparison videos like this I always wish the YouTuber would give the conclusion front said that if I don't want to watch the whole video I don't have to so can we go in summary the experience of making notes on an iPad Pro versus iPad was pretty much identical my friend Charlotte to notice no difference between writing on her iPad and my iPad Pro very slight difference between the two user experiences therefore if you were student I would probably recommend that you save the 300 lb of $300 and you buy the normal iPad with apple pencil instead of the iPad Pro elaborating on reacting to using each other's iPad so you can see what that experience would like frost if you're into that sort of thing on the main differences between the iPad Pro and the iPad after slightly increased gap between the screen and the the gloss which is what everyone is talking about and funny we going to end with some of my own personal thoughts on pricing of iPad Pro vs iPad and why I would still personally probably get the iPad Pro instead of the iPad but I'll explain why this is not a recommendation that I would have import upon everyone as usual time times for everything is going to be in the video description so please don't watch this whole video if you don't have time to skip to the appropriate time to the video of me and Charlotte testing each other's iPad pretty much showing how we found no difference between the two doodle a bit of right how we would normally write notes and then we'll swap iPads and we'll see if we can go to the difference between hello my name is Ali This Is The Moment of Truth okay what do you think this is really really good this is really responsive there's really not much difference between this and when I'm writing I feel no difference to tell the difference wasn't particularly noticeable but there were some differences in and the user experience between the two differences that I noticed between the iPad Pro and the iPad the main one is that with the iPad that was a very slight increase input lag between the apple pencil touching the glass and the words appearing on screen and here a slo-mo side-by-side comparison of the two and as you can see on the iPad Pro it's pretty much instantaneous between when you touch the gloss and write the thing where is on the iPad there is a slight delay this has been slowed down. animal rights you can notice a difference quite City here but in real life it's really not that noticeable if you are considering the iPad Pro versus iPad and you're thinking that maybe this input lag is going to make a difference to you I would really suggest you go to the Apple store and try both of them out you will notice a very slight in iPad that is just completely going to stay there is a increase got between the glass in the screen on the iPad which is not there on the iPad Pro 11 screen so it looks and feels as if you're writing on the screen itself 120 hertz refresh rate which means stuff appears more smoothly and you can notice when swapping between wild framerate of the Ohio that was the first thing I noticed the first time I tried out and iPad Pro and that is again difference simple Act II very much difference was that the iPad Pro feels like a very premium product the laminate screen feels lovely luckily iPad Pro because the screen is not fully like laminated but I could I could tell holding in my hands of this feels slightly inferior in quality to the iPad Pro walking there is a noticeable decrease in quality between a pepperoni differences and of course if you are using graphics-intensive applications than the iPad Pro is going to perform better than the iPad but has been using the iPad 2018 for the last few months she said there was never any time that she's fell to the iPad is a little bit slower than my iPad Pro independent changing colors of things. I suppose she's gone used to it but as someone who's been using iPad Pro for the last few months it was it was possible so I suppose the real question is and if you're still with us then you probably interested in this is. You know there is a 300-pound 3 result of difference between the iPad Pro and the base model the iPad differences justify that 300 pound price tag for most people the most students if you're a student looking to just take notes browse YouTube maybe Edison what documents do student he sort of stuff pretty much no reason for you to get the iPad Pro unless you have a lost bag have to burn you like one of the top-of-the-range thing to the iPad Pro is is the Rolls-Royce the iPad is really good and it's half the price but it's not quite the Rolls-Royce if that make sense personally knowing now what I know about those two I would still probably buy the iPad Pro price difference between the iPad Pro for at least the next three years or 3 years about 150 weeks to 300 lb spreader over 150 weeks comes out to about 2 pounds a week so I'm thinking in my head is what I paid 2 pounds every week to have the benefit of an iPad Pro over a standard iPad how many facilities yes the reason relate to those two things first TV input lag between kind of the pencil and writing stuff on it which is there a feeling of the iPad vs iPad Pro the reason why I think the iPad Pro is Lot 2 pounds a week extra extra price point is that for me personally I would find it less of a pleasure to use the iPad than it is to use the iPad Pro Controller for iPad I was thinking this is good enough but it's not an abscess go to use where is when I use my iPad Pro it really is an absolute joy to write on I feel excited but I'm taking no tonight to the hill excited about whenever I have a new idea for video because I get to bust out the out pencil I got to do some like spinny stuff that is encouraged me of the time to write more notes to make my pants videos all this other stuff I feel so good that I've sort of taken up hand lettering on iPad and I'm also learning how to do like the digital Artistry and I wanted to be like a concept artist contact all that you get in games and movies and stuff and I'm going to meet you at Orioles trying to learn how to do all that stuff that stuff so to make sense because it's the Rolls-Royce and because the very Act of using it is so pleasurable the iPad is more functional it's quite nice to use but it's not as pleasurable so that pleasure Factor as weird as it sounds to me personally justifies this 2 pounds a week extra price tag and secondly because I personally make money by doing Tech stuff so free making videos or no coding or running my business doing graphic design all this other stuff I think personally that the fact that the iPad Pro encourages me to use my iPad more I think that will overall bring me more money than I'm spending this 2 pounds a week on having an iPad Pro rather than a normal iPad Pro in the iPad and I would appreciate the person giving a personal sort of insight into why they use what they use I think if I get good at hand lettering and get good at like sign on an iPad possibly doing illustrations that would benefit all of my website that would benefit my YouTube channel hold of this I think would in the long run make me more money than the two pounds away, spending on having an iPad Pro Rod than an iPad and of course the longer that I keep hold of the iPad Pro more ascanio discussed to get spread out of a time so if it becomes one pound a week and then that's even better very little difference between the iPad Pro and the iPad but it's a big jump in price at the difference between $300 or 300 pounds on 600 funny using internet and you sort of like this luxurious factor and you think that maybe it'll increase the amount of time that you spend on it and therefore that will have a knock-on effect and therefore that's probably worth money. If you're even concerned about that in the slightest go to an Apple store and see what you think don't take my boyfriend but for the most part for the vast vast majority of students who are not actively trying to make money on the internet using an illustration and graphic Center on old. instead of the iPad Pro video thank you very much for watching if you like the video please"

            "text": " regardless of how many productivity books week bulletin haven't read how many videos we've watched we all struggle with procrastination but procrastination is nothing new 10,000 years ago the ancient Greek philosophers even have a word for it akrasia meaning to act against better judgement by doing one thing even though we know we should be doing something else is ancient history is probably even more prevalent today as we live in a world full of distractions and perfect procrastination Temptation so how do we overcome it back to the channel I can you hit my name is Eliana. Selectman you can on this channel we explore the strategies and tools help us live healthier happier more productive lives but even for a self-professed productivity girl like me one of my biggest regrets in life is overcoming procrastination so well I'm very glad you was because procrastination is a perfect example of a thing called a present bias present bias at this idea that I can set whatever goal I Want For My Future Self but it's my present self sitting here right now that has to actually do the action to get and what is a choice between doing some exercises episodes of Hunter x Hunter we can always say while I'll do the exercise tomorrow and our present selves will always preferred a short-term instant gratification of washing random anime rather than the long-term goal of the a 2013 study by the famous researcher in the field of procrastination dr. Timothy in the privacy of short-term mood repair over the long-term pursuit of intended actions another what's procrastination is more about focused on the immediate urgency of managing negative boost and pushing the problem away rather than getting on with the task in the present moment the idea of delaying it because I don't feel like putting a cannula and does not even cross my mind also I tell people to space and freedom to manage my own time at home I can always just keep putting things off until the next day and like rationally we all know that procrastination bad for us like to meet one of my biggest fears in life is being Shackled to a job that I might not enjoy and I know that right now I'm at the age and a good opportunity to not procrastinate and build with the future work with the freedom to kind of do what I want and procrastination is actively holding me back but the good news is we can do something about it and there is a simple formula to overcoming procrastination that I've discovered over the last couple years and has really helped me personally in fighting the procrastination puzzle cost a few years ago that was a real paradigm shift from my mind and tell us how I think about motivation like I used to think that you need motivation to get something done but actually I feel that way around you get stuff done and then the motivation naturally follows Hayden told about his book at the motivation myth talks about motivation isn't something that you have it's something that you get he says that motivation is not the cause of action it is the result of action so it's like action comes first motivation from second the word motivation from my vocabulary and instead I think about it in terms of either discipline or in terms of habits discipline is energy that we put into the system will using a willpower we are being disciplined we are doing the thing but then once we do the thing often enough it becomes and we don't need willpower to do have it's like I don't need willpower to brush my teeth every night for the most part but I do need discipline to get up and go to the gym because going to the gym has not yet become I have it so one of this formula for overcoming procrastination was understanding motivation the second part is about understanding momentum and the key inside here is that most of the resistance that we feel when doing at all is just in the act of stopping this audio of resistance to discuss by Steven pressfield in his book The War of art describes resistance the universal force that has one sole mission to keep things as they are preventing action creativity and progress in other words resistance provides the Beating Heart of procrastination to go down and so the audience that it's not doing the work that's hard it is starting to work out the problem in kind of like if you had a ball at the top of a hill you caught me on the bull moving unless you physically push it but once you've pushed it starts running on the hill and then momentum and so if I feel like I'm struggling with procrastination I know that the real problem is just in the initial push it's just in getting started and I'm about three rules that I try to use if I'm struggling to get started with doing tonight we've got the 2-minute rule the 2-minute rule is a concept put forward by productivity Guru David Allen in his book and getting things done on the main idea is that if you have a pending tasks that can be done in less than 2 minutes then you should do it right away and so if I'm procrastinating 2 minutes I will try my very best to just do it and I will have this meant for that I must follow David Allen's 2-minute rule so if it comes to a refilling my water bottle or putting a coffee mug or gold weigh in the kitchen washing it so I kind of forced myself to just do it it's a 2-minute rule but if it takes longer and I'll write down the stuff that we go to do that's going to take longer than 2 minutes to drink a brain to the thinking so it's fine it's only going to be two minutes simple it's about if I'm finding myself procrastinating from something I have to do I tell myself that I'm just going to do it 5 minutes some people thinking that all we want to do is do the thing do the work for certain small amount of time and so when I was procrastinating from filming this video but I told myself it's all you have to do is shoot the introduction it'll take 5 minutes and then you can stop if you want to but here I am 3 hours later still smoking the problem isn't getting started in continuing to do the work and the two-minute Rule and the five-minute rule the third rule. I like to follow if he mind activation Rule and that is if I'm feeling like I'm in a slump what usually happens directly after lunch or in the evening when I come home from work I ready do anyting I'm procrastinating from filming the videos or whatever I need to get done and the mind activation rule is that when I recognize that feeling that the Haven my mind is like to do anything at that point I need to do something to stimulate my mind if it's before 2 p.m. and then I'll make myself a cup of caffeinated coffee but I like to use a non pharmacological method and that is by doing an online course over a brilliant to a very country sponsoring this video what's the super attractive and lots of problems along the way they treat you a little bit of something and then they do an interactive kind of problem activate the mind to get you out of that procrastination and you learn something along the way I really enjoyed working through the computer science courses in brilliant Dakota plastic introduction to computer science introduction to algorithms and also more complicated topics like neural networks machine learning a mind into learning something useful while also overcoming the productivity slump so if that sounds of your straight to head over to bring into Whole Foods and the first 200 people to click on that link in the description will get 20% of the annual premium subscription First Nation first understanding motivation second-biggest understanding momentum and then we felt about three rules for getting out of the slump so the 2-minute Rule 5 minute Rule and remind activation roll if you want a video about the motivation myth pretty good that'll be linked to the playlist over here along with some other videos that you might find helpful"

So in this video I want to discuss the issue with hopefully a little bit more nuanced than I did in the previous videos about the similarities and difference between coronavirus and the seasonal flu in terms of symptoms in terms of treatment in terms of the mortality statistics and how bad each of these things are for you from the information we go so far covid-19 or whether you just have the seasonal flu and only say the truth is just Mason symptoms alone it's really quite hard to know so this table is going from information from the World Health Organization and from the National Health Service the NHS of the UK covid-19 you are pretty, the main things and covid-19 seem to be a fever dry cough but to be honest the old together for the flu and yeah because they're both respiratory viruses and symptoms is the incubation. covid-19 is about 14 days I eat that's the amount of time that I can stay in your system before it starts to give you symptoms whereas with the standard seasonal flu the incubation time is a little shorter people asked me about 3 days if between catching the virus and developing symptoms how to tell the difference between a to just on the basis of that like how will you know when you quote the virus and how will you be able to say for certain when you started developing symptoms of the thing and we can't really use that as a differentiator between weather we've got covid-19 or what we've got this done to flu and as usual different countries different ways of resolving the conundrum so in the UK for example we put the NHS one-on-one helpline that you can call up and if you think you might have the flu or you might have covid-19 Bill be able to God you appropriately and one of the things they check is you know have you traveled to this list of countries have you had contact with anyone listen to have covid-19 which massive increases your risk of getting it whereas if you just for the symptoms but you don't have any of the epidemiological factors then it's more likely to be the flu rather than covid-19 that you really can tell just based on Simpsons alone so do whatever country you're in contact your local health care provider do not go into Hospital thinking you have covid-19 because then you just going to be infecting other people I'm sure every country will have the rent systems full doing the test in an isolated space sofa Gump in the UK we've got these the coronavirus pods outside most Hospital people do drive-thru Services where you can drive in your car someone will swap your mouth and then they'll do the test without you running the risk of infecting other people okay so we said that the symptoms of the two basically the same but what about the treatments and how firstly in terms of medication antibiotics will not work because antibiotics are antibacterial agents and both covid-19 coronavirus and the seasonal flu viruses and antibiotics and taking antibiotics if you think you have anti virus or a bit more complicated so in China and the US and a few other countries that working on files by the trying out drugs that we know what can some viruses like HIV and trying to see whether they might work against the coronavirus as well and sends of the seasonal flu we do have a drug oseltamivir Tamiflu that is sometimes given to patients who have severe symptoms when the first 48 hours but unfortunately we don't really have an analog to Tamiflu in the coronavirus covid-19 cases there is a big difference between covid-19 the flu does vaccine where is Coronavirus covid-19 vaccine just yet people are estimating that it will be at least 12 to 18 months before we get a vaccine developed in circulation for covid-19 whereas the vaccine kind of system the seasonal flu is very well-established in every year Sanchez around the world figure out what that that use common dangerous strain of the seasonal flu is going to be and make a vaccine against. At least in the UK that gets given to a load of people so for example people who work in healthcare settings I get the flu vaccine every year people who are old people have other medical problems those other criteria for who can get the vaccine and in fact in the UK if you want you can just go get the vaccine even if you don't fit into the criteria foot so far it's sounding like we can do about coronavirus have any medication that works against it with trying out some antiviral in the Hope fingers crossed they might work and we don't have a vaccine for an effect with covid-19 do anything we can really do is also supportive treatment for the people who need it so supportive treatment basically means helping your body to while your body naturally fight against the disease so this is what they do in intensive care sometimes things like mechanical ventilation sometimes with assisted ventilation it helps the patient breathes essentially like maintaining the respiratory function while while their immune system is watching us this is pretty similar to the treatment for seasonal flu as well so every year thousands of patients hospitalized because of the seasonal flu and again the management is most supportive they can end up on ventilator Support Agency helping the breathing while they're in body parts of the virus the good news is that the case of the flu most people the majority 80% around 80% covid-19 will have a mild symptoms which means they don't need help with their breathing but the bad news is that even though only about 15 to 20% of the patients actually get severe complications as we're covid-19 the fact that is going around in growing at an exponential rate means. Depending on how many people it infects in a population the number of beds in hospitals that can provide ventilatory support might be a limiting factor in Italy for example weather currently now 2172 confirmed cases of covid-19 as of the 10th of March when I'm recording this video we seen a few comments from Italian doctors specializing in intensive care via Twitter and Facebook and stuff that saying that the country has run out of intensive care beds to the point where elective operations having to become sold in operating Theatres of being converted into intensive care units because they just need so many more rtu beds in order to deal with the load of the virus. This is actually very concerning in the UK for example at the moment we only have 307 we confirmed cases of covid-19 and again the majority of those are going to be mild but there are more people starting to get admitted into intensive care in order to provide ventilatory support so if the virus spreads around the UK to the extent that has an Italy or maybe were there is a risk that we might run out of intensive care beds and that would cause enormous load on the healthcare system and that would mean that there would be some patients who need respiratory support but physically can't get it because older the Beds Are full at the moment sign Fleetwood not quite there in the UK but we know that it's basically advocacy you came to the Healthcare System possibly even more and they are really really struggling to deal with the implications of the coronavirus and in fact initially apparently the hospital distracted 200% of the normal capacity which is completely unsustainable for any Lifetime on the possible treatments for covid-19 and the season soothe let's not compare their mortality rates like which of those is actually more dangerous so far seasonal flu according to research hits around 4 a million people each year around the world 14 million of which around 400,000 people die every year but that gives immortality figure of less than 1% you might even have seen a glorious leader President Donald Trump talking about this idea in RI this conference you said that in America alone the standard seasonal flu kills between 25000 and 69000 people per year 360,000 people have died of the seasonal flu in America statistics when you compare those tens of thousands of people in America alone who die each year from the flu compared to the 23 people who have died so far from covid-19 that seems like a very large number of the standard flu compared to a very small number of deaths caused by covid-19 all the statistics that paint a less optimistic picture of covid-19 so you know how he said that the mortality rate for Intuit for influenza the seasonal flu is about 1% if we look at the figure covid-19 Surfer 116500 58 confirmed we have $4,090 which puts the mortality rate at roundabout three and a bit percent So based on the date the sofa covid-19 is about 3 times more likely to kill you than the seasonal flu infantis and something that will complicate this to be a little bit it's a side with that figures Pro a bit too high so for example of chief medical officer of England he says actually the total of the overall mortality rate for covid-19 is probably closer to 1% if not less than 1% would you put it at a similar footing to the seasonal flu and the reason why that's not Jason so far is that because a disproportionate number of cases were in the food Bay province of China which is why the out breakfast all day than that was not quite prepared to deal with the ramifications of the disease and the fact that there are so many cases that are probably running around that haven't been tested officially for Covenant and remember these 116500 58 confirm cases so far are just that they'll confirm cases the people who have had the test and have tested positive for it so in reality the number of people we have the condition but just have multiple teams like eight set of people infected with a virus to might not even know that they have the disease at Ole and therefore won't be accounted for in that overall confirmed cases estimate the other thing to keep in mind that isn't ready mentioned when people talk about this whole flu versus coronavirus thing is the fact that we know what the flu we know it's not for progression we've developed vaccines for it we put treatments for it we know what the score is with the flu and yeah it's unfortunate that every year. Million people get infected by and 400,000 people die from it but it is the enemy that we know about the problem at the moment is the Coronavirus covid-19 is the enemy that we don't know about we don't really know a lot about it yet we know roughly some details mean of vaguely what kind of sentence is closer than we do thankfully have a test that confirms or reject whether whether or not you have the condition but we don't have any treatments we don't have any vaccine you don't know how quick is going to spread we don't even really know for certain how coming on to spread our best area which I think is probably right is that is an Airborne virus particle disease but it's not exponential rate like everyday was seeing more and more cases on the fact that a lot of the world isn't yet prepared for dealing with that I don't fact a little the world isn't even really taking it seriously though that means that we're dealing with an enemy here that we really don't know much and that could be a lot worse than we anticipated so this comparison between coronavirus and the flu yes it works on some levels but it usually fails to appreciate the fact that it's a lot easier to deal with something you know about like a flu so hard to deal with someone you don't know about that is spreading through shawty like wildfire on that is causing problems already for first world Healthcare systems that are not able to go cuz I finally just quickly told me about the effects on Society of coronavirus versus the flu ya ever you're fully many people get the flu for 2,000 people. no one actually cares like we don't stop events the global financial markets don't shut down we don't close schools and businesses and stuff because of the flu we certainly don't put entire countries into lockdown because it's loose on the other hand because of covid-19 because of the uncertainty surrounding it about we don't really know how to make bacon. Is we don't really know how quickly is going to spread only talked to his mean that we're taking as a society it's a good thing that we are taking those precautions to try and delay it spread or even contain it spread and so for example around the world list of high-profile event that would involve Mass Gatherings people you'll see them list over there somewhere all these events had to be canceled because of the coronavirus this talk that the Olympic and paralympic games in Tokyo 2020 told that you are 2020 cancelled I don't people to go to the economic impact of the coronavirus which we've never really before seen with a with outbreak of the seasonal flu so if we're going to pull the stock market has taken over the last few days to weeks to the point where people are comparing it to the 2008 financial crisis Chris kael like if you get businesses in schools and communities shutting down all the things that's going to have an impact on society formoso with covid-19 bendy seasonal suit up so that was not line of the similarities and differences between the two as usual we want to be #alert panicking is never the right solution but with information that's been coming out every day this is seeming like more and more of a global threat and so we really should take it seriously and we certainly shouldn't be using the comparison with the seasonal flu as a reason for being complacent about the threat coronavirus in the video description to more helpful resources on the topic stay healthy say happy and hopefully I'll see you in July"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel in this video I'm going to be doing a quick review of the rocketbook Everlast Smart Notebook an additional going to start with the conclusion that I will talk about the features the two main features behind a joke about some of the weaknesses and then it will end by doing a little giveaway of copies of this rocketbook Everlast notebook before we get started I just want to mention that this is a sponsored review but whenever I do sponsored reviews I make it clear to the brand that it's going to be my own unadulterated opinion I'm not going to let them tell me what to say if that makes sense but to be honest there's nothing that you or them worry about because I have to be like this until you up from conclusions that yes this is worth the money that you pay for it it's got two main features that are instead of selling points at the first and most important one of my opinion is like a SMART Notebook QR code on it and it was about these little icons that you can program program to do whatever you want so for example what I've done is outside the first iPhone that whenever I shade in this particular books if I would have stayed the same and then I scan the page using the rocketbook iPhone app and it's paper apps every pot for and what it does is that it recognizes that are shaded this icon in and that was magically sent the page as a scan straight into my Evernote inbox and this is what he North workflow because someone like me who's essentially going paperless but I still kind of like writing and physical notebook size when I started watching this low tonight in 17 album all the benefits of paperless I want my note to be searchable and to be archived until you have a copy of the call McCloud. This just makes it super easy to sing stuff no toll to OneDrive or Google Drive at 1 or whatever other service you want to use and this is how that synchronisation thing work so essentially you would go on the rocketbook app and then hit music on your page processing send and that's automatically just in like two tops it was massively just because I've highlighted this particular books so that's kind of the main setting Point behind it and secondly it's called the rocketbook Everlast because finished using up all the pages we have to do is get a microfiber cloth which is supplied in the package a little bit and then you can wipe and the ink just comes right off in fact when for the right now all the line so I can go ahead of the microfiber rocketbook branded so I'm going to try and get rid of the stuff on this page look at that I'm just different wiping it away and it's oldest disappearing so no I just have to let it dry briefly and then I'll be able to reuse this entire page this is like magic main features behind it but I think if you want to invest in a notebook it should it should be a pleasurable experience and the things I'm comparing this to is my trusty Lordstown 19:7 and I really love the experience of writing on this is so nice and I will be like tanning out emails and planning out videos and stuff I was surprised to find that it's actually the same with the rocketbook like it's a different sort of feed a paper like you can imagine it this paper's waterproof so it doesn't feel flimsy like normal paper it feels slightly laminated but I was surprised by how nice the experience was of writing on this if I was going to do a bit of doodling the ink flows across the page will it would slightly resistance than it does in a physical notebook you can probably sound but doing the same thing on the rocketbook there isn't really scratchy sound and I didn't experience of watching the rocketbook a slightly different to normal but very free flow is very smooth which month going along gang long but it just felt it felt like I was making progress and that's a nice feeling to have a notebook because then it encourages us to write in it Mal and tons of drawbacks I think the only major drawback is that you don't really get the Romanticism of something like this the reason I like writing this one is because once I finished it up then I can stick a sticker on the spine I can archive a I can say in a 2019 or whatever I do overtime over tenia. I'll have liking it a ton of these books and it would just be a cool like women you don't really get that with a notebook that you going to keep on reusing it kind of like the difference between a Kindle and physical books by physical book to give you a bit more Romanticism it gives you a bit more like a you know I've got these books across my bookshelf I like the feel of a notebook in my hand I'm a big evangelist for the Kindle because I think that the benefits of a Kindle maybe the fact that you can highlight stop the 5 you can take with you wherever you go unlimited books etc etc all the things that made videos about the benefits outweigh the lack of Romanticism Romanticism in the rocketbook Everlast notebook but it's very utilitarian like you know you use it using it every now and then you delete the page essentially version I don't have any use for this but for example if I were medical student and on the woods and you know when you're on the road that you to carry a piece of paper with you so that if you come across a condition like I'm at Tangiers disease you are going to write down in your little notebook Tangiers disease and then when you get home you can look it up students carry similar-sized notebooks to this but this just noise because it's a lot thinner than most people carry and it's reusable and you don't really have a need to in a look at this stuff again once you've already synced Avenue and once you've looked up what time does disease before wrapping up I just want to mention to give away that we're doing so if you fancy getting one of these you can use my coupon code which will people think in the video description on with links and video description about give you like a 10% discount but I'm going to be sending one of these two would like pain in the second stuff if you want to win that just comment something down below on the on the YouTube video Clint like whatever you want but pleasing include your Instagram username so that I'll randomly pick for people and I'll message you asking for your address and then we will mail out these Cavanaugh Netflix to you and then you can start using them and start going paperless with your nose in a semi envelope format video"

            "text": " hello everyone and welcome back to making up this is episode 5 in the last episode was a little bit about how we start made a prototype and so the Prototype allows us to quickly design and when it's done will be up to get quick feedback from people just and idea of whether it's being good what works well whether the flow seems to transition you can see that there are five main types of the buses of the next step is to appease animations that we've been talking about and so we're going to use a program called and vision which is a free to use as you can see how to create an account loaded sketch so that we can link the virus pages together three things go hotspots today is just show you how we link the basic pages together so just to create a few animations in a few links between will be created so far from the homepage you want to make link soda links to the various sheet for the button as well as to add an operation select schedule the operation for which is the main part of our sfscl click and drag one of these hot spots this immediately asked me where I wanted to link to sew from HeroClix page 116 think through last me what animation I want so for this one going to slide up from the Bustin so we simply pick slide up not done so the next step is to let's see if I click shift and click through go to next page for going to run through the series The screens we have four screens in total which carry between each stage of having an operation so each time I'm taking dragging across the neck I'm going to run through to next page we have the saving exit function take me about 15 minutes just to make a basic run through using the designs that we've made something surprisingly easy to use I didn't end up making prototype then it seems like there's two major stats when it's just to design what you think it will look like you can even use some of that power points for muscle pain if you need to just get your design on paper next we have all these different slides that we can use and we just want to create these links between them so using its Envision software has been really really that he is literally a click and drag to create a person and what you talking about send LinkedIn kiss together on the beauty of indigenous we can download at 3 tomorrow iPhone so you cannot be tested using the device that you unset ultimately have it on you seeing how it is to actually make a prototype that is designing stage takes a bit more time but actual linking up and making a Nation outfit Andre bring the whole thing to life is very easy to do that you can do in an afternoon once you've downloaded made an account on basic functions of the software that you're using for the first time. Leave the next step which is just a code that thing said it's we assume will take a lot longer that I'm going to be learning for the first time as well so stay tuned to the next video but hopefully we'll go through some of the starting blocks with codeine I hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you in the next episode fight"

            "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoqjLxRBIMQ",
            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew him my name is Ali and I'm an FYI one Junior doctor working in Cambridge on in today's episode of medical Mondays we're going to be taking a comprehensive look at what it takes to study medicine in Europe so it will just had results today and if unfortunately you didn't study medicine in the UK or you missed your office then might be another option and that is to study medicine in Europe now I really didn't know anything about this until a few weeks ago I got a message from this guy called Abdullah who runs an agency that helps people study medicine in Europe advertisers thing but I replied saying that why don't you come over to my place we can record a video where I am to you explain to all of the viewers exactly how how how it works it's a degree in registered by the GMC hold stuff so we recorded like a half an hour long interview on in the interview I tried asking all the questions that I think a prospective medical applicant what else interview this is enter this New Year medical student and I currently study in Bulgaria I have 260 of course and it is divided into three Soul section so the first two years our preclinical then the next three years of the Year 325 you have your clinical years and then the final year is an inch which is basically like at 1 in the UK is equivalent to it and the GMC recognizes that is well okay have an extra option just in case you don't get any offers on Casey to make the referral for other reasons I mean that's exactly why it's cool because a lot of people they don't meet that office or they don't have to grade requirements to even apply for medicine in the UK stop playing my to told me that there's not really any point apply for medicine but I still didn't work out annoying that I had The Back-up Plan and was something that really helped out okay do grades do you need to do medicine in Europe as opposed to the UK lower requirements in USA please don't have any grade requirement but they do want you to do biology and chemistry a-levels now the way it works is each university has an entrance exam which you need to study for and pass in order to actually make it to the university and then the top the are ranked and they're giving admission so that's so high works it's more entrance exam base then based on your Edibles which gives you a second chance if you didn't do so well in Euros you can still make it up in the entrance exam San Francisco syllabus and you can walk around it and to get practice papers you can study for a very easily and make it through okay September when you finish in like July or what time there's one University could Club in Medellin he that has a bit of a different schedule so they start in February and then they finish in the following December okay so what would you say are like why wouldn't you want to go to Europe like why is it would it be fair to say that it's it's better to study medicine in the UK or do you think that actually going to Europe that is his kind of a good thing to do for the most part we're getting a place to study medicine in the UK is ideal because it's more convenient but in terms of your actual degree and fight and the job prospects that come with it I don't really see much difference between starting in Europe and studying in the UK because at the end of the day you'll still the same things because medicine is medicine and at the end of the day if you didn't get that UK there's no point looking into other career prospects if you do have the option of selling medicine in Europe you're too kind of talking to you I just never really considered that you're in my head was do you have to have Brady Bunch parents to be able to pay the however tens of thousands of pounds fees to go to Europe or the Caribbean the Caribbean yeah I know it's a bit expensive but when it comes to Europe if he's actually lower than the UK it's 8000 Euros per year which is roughly around 6,000 lb and the cost is split between two semesters so a 3000 lb in the beginning of your first semester we started September I knew you pay three thousand pounds at spavia second semester which usually starts in February sub phatty cheapest well compared to the UK my personally my living costs Contour around 500 lb or less a month one bedroom apartment universities in London and they're paying veteran is based on weeks not worked and yeah so you can get a nice luxury one-bedroom apartment still ain't from around 230 which I'm paying too expensive I studied does Romania that's hungry and the other options as well available in places like Poland but I don't know too much about that no more about Bulgaria Romania in Cambridgeshire from Poland apply yourself so you go for your GMC registration number I need apply through the GMC and then you look for jobs the same way a UK student would but when you're at a place together but you were saying play we were on the second because you already have done 606 PA in Bulgaria which is an internship as F1 and they do exempt you from going straight into my phone so you can apply for just at two jobs so how many post are available for a few students I get the impression from Foley to the hospital. It's quite hard to get a place where you won't move entrance exam to actually and apply for your GMC registration number is flying from 2022 and it's an exam which is going to be forgiven by both UK students and international students so I'm off the so anyone that does apply now and from now on they will have to send eye exam so you're the way you get place and where you can find jobs they'll already depend on what year you can marry scores like okay it's just going to be based on that or is this kind of up in the air at the moment we're not quite sure which is why I give too much detail as far as it goes. okay turn off so it sounds like studying medicine in Europe then becomes an option it's not the ideal option as you said because of lack of convenience struggle and then definitely applying in the UK is going to be a much more convenient option for you and obviously traveling Pro. connect to Europe where we help students apply abroad we help them find apartments holding with the whole process I find out one like the 15th of August or whatever result say is what is the process and how does your agency or other kind of agencies fit in you need to be to see what's up register for the entrance exam and set the entrance exam which is held at the campus of the University and that they have their own application is because this process can be quite tedious a bit and different obstacles that you may not know how to open so what we do is we made the process very simple what happened is because it is an international process you have to get your documents legalized notarized and all of this legal stuff you have to go through and it can be quite and it can be a bit of a hassle so we take care of all of that we help with the entrance exam as well so with the resources available and it might not be enough what university provide so we have our own resources which paper and as medical students to you know get that sold boost to actually and help them out when they go for the entrance exam help students when they are applying to the university to actually get the admission okay so how do I know which university I want to apply for you can reschedule different universities on our website we have all the universities that we cover listed and a little bit of information on each of them so in terms of Academia all the universities of very similar in terms of facilities and the teaching it really comes down to is the social life and living standards because he's such as Sophia unplugged everything quite big and then the quiet Sofia Sofia Sofia for and in particular it's a very big city is so applied and it's the capital city of Bulgaria so if you're studying that you're going to have a much different life to say another situation could Bona and they have a middle school there which is right next to the beach Community as well so with a universal like Bona you have a lot of German students there where is William Quotev there's a massive massive uk-based community in terms of this website miss my offer and it's currently August when do I have to apply and do a few of the universities in September and September course usually starts late September of the bodega entrance exam is done for the University of the Medical University entrance exam dates for this year or 3rd of September and 10th of September so what you do is you have to apply before one of those dates you register for the entrance exam you start Gathering of documents and getting them done through the legal process and then when you go to the U entrance exam you have to hand in the documents been on the 15th of September you get a list of all the students that have made it through and if you're on that list and you can bend. Looking to pack your bags and actually move abroad very crazy in like 2 weeks you have to have University so you still get a bit of time with that one but if you're looking to just start straight away. Still an option because you can do the entrance exam early September and start looking to move abroad by the end of September that sounds like studying medicine York definitely an option its qualifications recognized by the will do universities. They recognized as a whole list of them and on the GMC website for that okay so so the way it works in Bulgaria specific he is that you have your professors they all speak English and you of course is completely to an English however you do learn Bulgarian on the side as well locals when you're out and about and I also speak with patients who might not know English later on when you and your chemical years but it's very basic stuff Nothing by his people should be worried about because all the time when you by the time and you like she needs to use the language you'll be there for a pretty long time so you'll pick it up along the way patients that don't know English I try to use Bulgarian even though my brother has a scratch but the University's do also provide if your Bulgarian really isn't that good so that you should be able to speak Bulgarian so they do teach it okay but none of your studies will be one of my professors he did a few years in the University of Manchester and one of my biology professor at the University of Cambridge similar in like frog and Romanian stuff at this point I've missed my offer I'm feeling sad but I do kind of need to be able to pay about 6,000 pounds plus so fun your studies and I'm usually parents help out with this if not there are a few students who try to come back to the UK as often as possible to fund their Studies by doing jobs and I know one of my friends he centers when he's back in the UK a few of my other friends they already have previous degrees such as Pharmacy and biomed and they can just come back and do Locum jobs so there are ways of finding your degree other than getting loan the end of the day you'll be blown free as well so what's the deal with the agency agency is that the agencies as well. Do the work that we do which is basically to help students apply abroad help with the application process help with the legal stuff help with the entrance exam help with settling in and relocating to Bulgaria the problem with other agencies is that they usually tend to overcharge students and they don't really provide the right services and also as medical students recognize this quietly on Amazon you know what this isn't fair we want to actually help students I'm rather than them getting overcharged like we did when we were playing so we decided because we learned the application process and how everything is done we made the right contacts and now we can actually help other students who are applying rather than them getting overcharged and you know going through an agency that might not help the best it can be quiet over hassle applying abroad and they can put people off a plane or boat altogether because as I said the mainly is the legal stuff done dealing with the entrance exam just you know knowing that you have an agency to back to you and give you the right resources the right information is always useful so why should I approach you and what you offer me so when you come to us we have two separate packages that we offer the basic package and Advance package the basic package only deals with the optic process and the advance package deals with everything from start to finish so we will help you with the application process will help you with the relocation entrance exam will help you during your studies because boobs that we have all the resources for each year of study me and provide that and also your degree and because by that time we would have worried you know how much do these packages cost roughly cost around the advance package cost around 1,200 lb this can change depending on the time of year how busy we get and because Brazil's day we do got some very busy so it's best till 5 I just want to go to make sure that you secure the best price yet for a services on the basic package pay the 1,200 pounds and then I don't get in is that is that a thing people don't get into these universities or together it was a security deposit for us to do the work for you and then after you accidentally University is when you pay the majority of the fee so if you don't get in it's not like it's not a total and we will help you then apply to a different University if you don't get into the University of your first choice okay okay so he did not have any opportunity to study medicine in the UK but they still managed to get in as well because it really depends on how well you perform in the entrance exam rather than how well you did in your edibles they just really focused on the entrance exam because they only picked the top students in the rankings but then there is a waiting list as well and many students after I actually reconsidering in September that say they say you know what I'm going to take a cat piano when is pride going to the UK so because of that law students actually don't take that place that gives space for other students to take those places other than that because that's only universities available if you don't get into one you left again to another is there so it's it's a sounds like what you're saying right now is that you can I have the worst result in the UK and was inducted into medicine competitive here about someone in Yoruba issues with Shamu competitive than the other in a nice city like myself in Plovdiv is more competitive than another situation is a bit farther away a bit smaller like Alexa Clyburn which is in situated in the best locations which doesn't make your eyes competitive and because of that the infant is more easier presumably that is like multiple reasons. I will put things in the video description and whatever you watching this and on your website there's going to be more information systemax and African students backgrounds because they are so focused on you know becoming a doctor and find they do tend to find ways to fund the degree Tienda party why the grade boundaries in the UK play highest if you get season even though the entrance might be easy if the course is not the same as it would be in the UK and that is why if somebody does get into the university they still have to keep up with workload you have to spill you know what crazy heart especially if you do get seasoned he's IA tables at because I just said it will be more challenging for those students than those that have a say a student's with because demo confidence in the abilities and then they the ones that end up failing rather than the students that have seasoned and you know they work harder than the other students and they actually make it through so I suppose you just got to pay some money that you have money to greatest thing and why do you came in late is coming along in the first place to actually standardize old doctors because at the moment the only people that have to say an exam is people that are coming from outside of Europe and that really meant that students from the UK and Europe if they scratch then they wouldn't really have any tests to actually prove that however now with the UK m&a is going to be for UK students Europe's European students and international students alike so everyone has to sit the exam everyone has to show improve themselves so it's not a case of all I'll go backwards I'll just get my medicine. it seems like a dream come true but less because they're going to program but that's not the case is recognized by the gym so you can find the university on the GMC website they've got a whole list of universities that they recognized and because of that is going to because the living Coast Solo in Bulgaria that I can get more for my money and I can actually enjoy my time at University moving I think I would when I if I took a place in the UK that's because I'm comparing with my friends they always broke next to Greece and Turkey so during weekends and breaks its Victory just a bus ride away to go to Istanbul which has increased so we've got grazed in a lifetime why do you think I would take place in the UK application station background check how to do I have to if I want to applied that year I have to do a very rapid turnaround but I also would leave for a few weeks all right I'll find a house to go for private Apartments because they all cheat and the closer to the University campus mosquitoes provide accommodation student dorms but they're not really that nice because you have to share them with another person is just a small room with two beds and a fridge for sale yours a month for that because so many students are going to Bulgaria there is a lot of investment that is going on there right now with the new buildings being built especially for students with one bedroom two bedroom apartments so even if you want to share with someone you can get 500 euro 2 bedroom apartment and shared between two people circus and then at that point you have the option of applying to the UK for F2 yes but what kind of Note 4 with the full details about going to be six years down the line because of the UK Mainland because of how things are going to work so I think at the moment it's not of the same process of the F1 Hazard F12 but I imagine once you came out of sanitizers do the UK MLA whether your UK student Lawrence talking to you shouldn't worry about your job prospects later on you will you somewhere else no just to UK to be honest practice medicine anywhere in Europe without causing any entrance exams or anything like that so accepted old throughout the year and then of course if you want to go to us you can do the USMLE information like the GNC's website and where you can find all of this. AllSouth on your way what is going to be links in the video description to order the stuff that we mention including all the websites like the older list of universities of the GMC except agency you can check it out if you priced have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video"

this video but it's going to be a little bit different and not I'm going to be reacting specifically to me generated from the Cambridge University Medical School so these are all very nice but I've never seen you before I did so we'll see how that go I hope you have fun too many people number one oh okay so this is a reference to the fact that medical electives which is supposed to be in a different country but a lot of people treat it as a like going to the beach I think that's what this roses are red bones they can fracture collagenase clostridium histolyticum collagenase bacterial enzyme is an enzyme that produces and Trends contracture is like this weird thing that happens to your hand in certain conditions like liver disease the reference to the fact that in a second year of medical school we learn about all these weird is that are drugs like baked aa8644 which one to use experimental and actually used in real life so you know that's funny yo dawg I hate you like feedback back on the section on giving feedback that's kind of funny because Cambridge as medical school is obsessed with getting feedback from the students this is a good thing objectively but the students like to make fun of the fact that we get Ultra feedback so often and text deals in GC veins veins and then you think ooh I want to Canada or take your blood and to get rid of practice so we learn by practicing on each other that's a reference to that OK every medical school like needs to have this kind of every medical student like everywhere I had the books that you supposed to sign off when you've done so and clinical skills like putting in a catheter and the Joker is that everyone could have waited till the last minute to get these signed off on the 8th of us the emails also says that hey you should have your clinical skills find out by the end of the year and no one's going to find out by the end of the year so they have to extend the deadline but in the end it's a requirement for the General Medical Council that we have these skills and also we get around to doing the grad students degrees and then apply to which is not normal in the UK in knowing that you can you go straight into medical school from second-floor from high school in the US and in other places you do your undergrad degree first and then you do med school so it's this is making fun of grad students I guess so degree frame which means they're really old wedding ring with me the married and Time Turner travel back in time or they just get lost up done find something admitted that the reference to Met-Ed which is the sort of virtual learning environment online Google Drive of of the medical school in Daytona and famously it was hard to find how to use computer public April like captopril and lisinopril and they all end in dril said that the funny April are out of date mechanism of action and that is the the pharmacology lectures that we get in a second yeah and this is again a reference to the fact that we get to about all these drugs that are historical an old fashioned and stuff in the tummy somewhere this guy is it is this monkman from from like 2 years ago University challenge yeah I think it's probably but that would be I've done tell of a timetable University in the world that sometimes change all that's a good reference of this is a reference to I think it's a patient cool was it will it Phineas Gage I think that was his name he was a guy who was in a railroad accident would like a railroad run is brain but he convinced vibey just it just went through his frontal lobe so he had profound personality change and this is one of the classic cases in in Psychology I think it was takotsubo cardiomyopathy precordial catch syndrome or Hey kid what did I tell you my husband and it's common knowledge that the easiest way to do that is to do an audit or to analyze some data from an old at where you to collect all the data about stuff going on in the hospital and running away as soon as when she asks you what you do if you hit the ground with normal or50 exams you have to do a newborn baby check on like a dull and you have to do they examine the hips to see if there's any dislocation to hit and one of the questions. what would you do if a hip examination was normal and that's a bit baffling because you expect question what would you do without normal and you got like a list of things you do baby without normal but if it's normal do you like CBC abbreviations and any kind of abbreviations and stuff that when you're just starting out in your father or your first your clinicals I thought you really hard to figure out what things done for you have to end up Googling everything I'm not going to express his ventricular heave cutting up someone accidentally I think I think this went around sometime like lost your two years ago Jeremy corbyn is the leader of the Labour party in the UK and he famous we have this moment on TV where he was kind of holding his hand up like this again some running woman who she is actually how you assess for right ventricular heave so the right ventricle to the part of the heart and in certain heart condition and if you do that you can feel like the movement against your hand and that would be cool to heaving the final sin cos tan Hawk Edition I think I've known about oh so that's Theresa May and she looks to be a bacteria or pathogen or something trying to attack a cell and the cell is protected by the NHS the UK this is Jeremy corbyn fighting off this bacteria so this is a very left-wing pro-labor government way of kind of looking at politics in the UK calzone will we find intelligent life couldn't move right here or not cuz it could it be this month that's rank applicants by decimals but make University blind okay this is this is really salty sow in the UK when when you finish the final year of med school and you're getting jobs jobs within the National Health Service are up and down the country where you end up is sort of based around how many points you get in the score out of a hundred and the contributing factor to your score 200 is where you rent in your medical school so if you were in the top 10% you would get 10 points some top 20% you get Nonpoint stop 30% you get a points and if you're in the bottom 10% you don't get one point so it means you know the higher-ranking you medical school the more points you get in this thing but people at you know supposed to be elite prestigious universities Like Oxygen Cambridge love to complain about the fact that these rankings are University blind so the joke acquainted the thing that complaining about is that oh well you know if you came first that's all he came top 10% in a low rank University you would be getting more points than someone who came up 20% at Cambridge budget that supposedly coming ranking higher at Cambridge and Oxford would be harder than ranking higher at a less prestigious University. Mills of 1 and 1000 dependent butamine is a type of drug that spread of the heart and an echocardiogram is assertive ultrasound of the heart that you can look and see what the hot looks like 0.5 is what you get if someone someone having anaphylaxis severe allergic reaction you would inject adrenaline into them to try I'm dumping down the response to that result are open, Cisco I can feel When the Beat Drops second degree heart block mobitz type heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat and then you drop a beat so you miss a base and its go to drop fade so When the Beat Drops... By three ampules of Lidocaine 3.1% be used with 1 and 2 billion adrenaline 16 play some 5 minutes how many bananas can I eat for lunch yeah Kasich sometimes exam questions that this is what they like Ryan so have you decided to do this thing about trying to teach resilience to medical students about because you know a big part of being a doctor is about being resilient in the face of adversity but we just kept on getting these emails like every single week about you do a reminder to take part in this this is a reference to the University was obsessed with trying to get us to fill out this questionnaire ultrafifa Neo a and my mind this is arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis so arthroscopy procedure that with Vedic surgeons do why they cut a hole into the knee and kind of look through it with a camera but famously there been studies while he Studies have shown that the actual operation is just as good as sham surgery surgery is when you put a cut in the skin and you like any type of patient and stuff and you do everything as if you're going to do the operation but you don't do the operation and it's one way of trying to figure out the placebo effect of surgeries but it's easy enough to find a placebo effect if you're just taking a pill they just took a pill instead that doesn't do anything but it's a lot harder when someone actually having surgery because they're recovering all of these factors play a part in the Pacific affect so what does referencing is that Bethesda actually arthroscopy is identical to Placebo so the operation doesn't actually do anything and so this guy thing change my mind this is legit me Drug Company reps like sales sales people often coming to hospitals and it's into universities and provide free sandwiches for lectures of folks in return for being able to plug their drug for 5 minutes during the same kind of like YouTube videos where the YouTuber will plug skillshare.com or audible.com. but in medicine like beat we allow the salespeople to plug the drugs and saying how might this drug companies should not be allowed to buy their way into stuff by offering free sandwiches as bad as it used to be in the past in the past used to get drug companies on a flying Doctor's first car to holidays and stuff and then setting them to drop how long has I'm going on patient awhile some time off then one of the questions that when someone says how long has it been going on for a while I know it's sometime but like the right way of pushing guys okay I'll wait till King minutes or hours or days a week no no no no and then you kind of get the information you need this is the references unimpressed looking kid when someone says a while anyway are the university I think a lot of them are General medical student things but a lot of them are sort of inside jokes and stuff but you know hey Everything Medical meme review so I thought I'd make this the first one if you like the video thumbs up let me know in the comments what you saw this videos in a playlist of videos you can check those I feel like I'll see you in the next video"

Obstetrics & Gynecology that's Women's Health on delivering babies basically she thinks physics and maths and we'll just go to medicine at University probably medicine doesn't really require much thinking it's just a lot of content you need to memorize I will get into medical to be like today I really like Medical School Mexico to six years and NBA's only like two years six years is better than to do you have regrets in studying medicine never what subjects do you have to take to get into medicine at 8 record most bases require chemistry most cases require one extra science websites of the various different universities on I wish I bought three more my favorite grey t-shirt cuz it fits nicely and is not too tight as not to loosen doesn't shrink in the wash Abercrombie at All Saints have like decent grade t-shirts I've tried so many tacos are not a mess fun of time but yeah All Saints grey t-shirts does Cambridge support Med students financially supports old students financially so like if you're from a low-income family than the Cambridge groceries really good and a lot of my friends who were from low-income families got loads and loads of money for I can buy the cameras grocery the problem is if your soda from a middle-income family where you don't quite meet the criteria for the bursaries but also your parents not like super rich so then you have to cut a budget of it but otherwise Cambridge has a lot of financial assistance how do you feel at this current moment not really stressful because what does that mean visitation is over they'll say I talk to my first attempt activities to do during the summer before starting medical school to ensure their best repair disposable this is a very good question do not try and prepare for medical school there's no point in anything you do anything you should do prepare at 2 to prepare is watch watch my videos about study techniques and read some books about study techniques read the book make it stick which is all about effective study read Tony buzan so how do I rearrange books about memory formation and tricks to improve your memory that the difficult thing about medical is that they're just so much content that you have to learn and if you've got decent techniques in place for maximizing memory and retention and stuff that is really useful going into it other than that the slippery no point doing anything spend your summer working on a hobby or skill getting better at something cool I don't know any musical instrument learn guitar England dakotaland graphic designer do whatever you want just work on something and kind of work to get better at it that's that's the advice that I would always give you mean moonwalking with Einstein about memory no I haven't but I will add it to my list and fact I'm going to buy on Kindle now I'm moonwalking with I I think I saw a recommendation for it earlier today alright let's grab it on the Kindle thank you for that all the students in medical school to keep officers playing on a soccer team yes medical school do absolutely everything I've got a friend who's on the University rugby team another friend is on the University football team another friend that Rose for the University that did their there do absolutely everything again we want to try and bust this mess that medical school is so hard I don't have time to do anything else in my life cuz that's this unhealthy and I supposed to know how he says Audiology is a kind of a mixture of Cardiology and Annie we get like a month and a and a and then three months in cardiology and then I'm not sure what I've got coming up after that congrats thank you thank you very much cell phone. Closer to the time specifically which will be on for the first was going to be in cardiology language Duolingo get drafted can you make something that you want to make and Downs race weekend in a week depending on how big the project is did you find out about you coming through the clouds interesting or did you not like some parts of them I don't care about you, Jay or about asylums and phones and stuff I thought most of chemistry chemistry quite cools most physical right but I wasn't a fan of the Plenty stuff in biology did you ever think of taking you so many 50 on Throne I did think about taking the Yosemite wanted me to take the USMLE I decided against Indian because I really like the UK so the Medtech than me like Medical Technology sphere in the UK is not as developed as in the US so if I want to do some kind of meditech or education Tech stuff it's easier to get into that in the UK you're kind of a big fish in a small pond rather than going to America where there's a lot of competition I don't know if our conversation I like taking things of a chill what you getting C3 and C4 and C3 and are you fluent I can speak conversational earlier but I can't understand like the news cuz it goes too fast are these big was what is something you can do a habit or otherwise that improves life the most yes Joseph that's a good question okay something that improves your life the most I was thinking about this earlier today I was thinking about what to write for my next email by the way. If you should subscribe to my weekly email newsletter there's a link in the video description and you can get my weekly email on Sundays where I give some like lots of ice and stuff anyway one thing I was thinking about is like and did this thing about developing a growth mindset and a growth mindset is the opposite to a fixed mindset I kind of dictates how you respond to things so for example that say you get a question wrong or let's say you you're struggling to insert a county line protection or something like that if you have a fixed mindset then people who people to fix mindset think oh crap I got bad grades are got this question wrong therefore I am a failure and near they take it personally and they don't want to hear constructive criticism because they it because it affects their own perspective add their own kind of perception of themselves so that kind of a fixed mindset where is growth mindset is the next time or a k I failed at doing this Camila next time people that have 6 months that don't like answering questions in class in case they get it wrong people with a growth mindset love answering questions in class because growth mindset is on the most important things you can do to improve your life and is one of the most useful things that I've done ever pretty much make a gym routine video house kind of going through the day greatest Showman is a much higher level than my reading ability so now I'm trying to kind of get back into it and hopefully learn a bit of musical Theory cuz apparently musical Theory Music just helps even when you're playing by ear so that's kind of what I'm looking at these days I thought about a podcast but podcast or a lot of work and I think it's important to have as Gary vaynerchuk until you can I have this kind of one main pillar of content and my main pillar of content died in a train make stuff for regularly and kind of an offshoot from that is kind of the email newsletter with a Blog but at what cost would just be so much work on the world has so many podcast there's some really good podcasts out there I don't really think I can add anything to the to the to the table for now with regards to park have you ever been to Manchester Bolton I have actually about some cousins who are in Wigan so we go visit them every now and then do you have a girlfriend since I yes I do have a girlfriend I think he's watching maybe she's looking at video games no over about three years but I still playing games I'm not really sure how I feel about video games like one part of my brain thinks video games are a waste of time but the other part of my brain things yeah but you know I read fiction a lot and people say that reading fiction is a waste of time and like TV's waste of time in which movies is waste time like episode of friends that you could friends from school Sonoma three-wheel playing World of Warcraft together play single-player games notified of Patrol on playing online games with people that you don't really get to speak to or you don't become friends with how much storage you have on your iPad are you fasting no not today I've had an infected wisdom tooth recently which is on the mend that I've been taking antibiotics and painkillers for 7 using that as a cop-out to no false did you ever consider Oxford I don't care about looks it'll Cambridge I went to Cambridge because I had a whole ums for my asses in the camper look at that back in the day so yeah what did you do for work experience Michelle hospital I did a week at South Bend hospital I did kind of every week once a week volunteering at a special needs school was once a week volunteering at a hospice I don't know they gave me amoxicillin and metronidazole and widened will wine on metronidazole and she was explaining that for pericarditis the name of the first one is amoxicillin for in fact even if you live in Cambridge you still have to go to the colleges that's like a requirement for undergrad that you're not allowed to live outside of college unless you have a very good reason to I think what happened in your usual interview I said some pretty things I came across as very arrogant they don't give me the offer then they said it could take an extra year they said they liked my application but they said I should take a year to develop my people skills and to try and lose the touch of arrogance so they can rule out what is the best I've done how to bring yourself up after you fail or get bad grades the case of that is by realizing the if you fail or get bad grades then. lost and building on the past never helped anyone that's what works for me anyway do we need to be good at math to become a doctor but you can become good at math I want to listen to get to eliminate for people to cover the race by the mass you just have enough foreplay or even open format for play or whatever in it you can prove it if you had the right instruction if you follow the right kind of set of guidelines you would improve a drawing so that's kind of some business I think it's a it's a common excuse that people say oh I'm just not good at math maybe that's full of teachers maybe that's the correct them but I need to be good at math to be a doctor no one doesn't calculations in the head anymore we have apps for that how do you find the preclinical I know I ain't quite like the preclinical Pinnacle split at the right thing about that is that it really breaks up your medical school time into these two discrete chunks of three years in three years I think if we just been doing her too much of the we've been doing now for the last six years that might have been that might have got a bit boring but the fact is that the first three years is very different experience to the final three which makes it a completely different city different area of life already enjoyed that I don't think we've as a year group as a university I don't think we suffer from not having clinical exposure alien world pretty quick learner so like it doesn't really matter went to West Coast High School for boys school please look so fast is my best NBA does that mean to drive a call yes I do can you work in the u.s. med off of finishing med school in the UK you have to take the USMLE which is the biggest barrier to that and you have to videos does an absolute goals when it comes to medical education as such high production value but it cost me about $1,000 to make each one I think was most videos would be improved if they had someone you know if you saw someone's face explaining stuff to you alongside I'm not a fan of just coming interactive whiteboard approach to education kind of like a Heart Academy thing I think it's much nicer when you have someone's face that I've come to explain things to you I like waving my hands a lot so if I make a video explaining stuff I would have pain in my face. and then maybe over late at have animations and stuff draw nothing that would be cool but yeah how does it like using a nobody truly mean quick to load it runs in a browser you can use you on any device XL seats are a bit more of a pain Google Sheets where we used to share people can update them live in real-time so actually in first and second gear we available for a course but there were no marks games so what we did is we made we made Google Sheets for each of the different subjects and we made her own mugs games and then you know I would do a paper and I would write down what I told ounces are and then someone else to do a paper and they would mock them use multi paper using my ounces I think that I will come in and do what she says he's bringing lovely clabber to features that everyone who has access from the web that helps with that sort of stuff cuz another trick to getting through University generally medical schools to be working together with other people and Google The Google Suite of apps that help with that Google Docs Google Sheets but Google is just so ubiquitous everyone uses this Saviour give you arrived in medical school in 2018 this year then you'll probably going to take the UK MLA and that suggested in notability was more than so I just went back home for some kind of right now I'm not sure what the hell you get such a big accommodation that's one of the benefits of being at Cambridge where your college give you a conversation this is a collagen house we're very lucky we pay really good price but it's absolutely massive accommodations what do you play video games that means low or history history would you suggest volunteering at you Noah 10-4 good buddy Michael Michael Jordan is good to do just long time in the more long-term you can do it the more impressive it sounds do you like the Pomodoro Technique I like handsome in some instances sometimes I think the 25 minutes is a bit restrictive and I don't have that I haven't cultivated the discipline for that then I like the Pomodoro Technique how many programming languages do you know PHP vaguely I'm learning note note but I mean I just about framework for that so I don't feel any desire to the no jazz on worth NHS initially anyway senior consultant and then maybe brunch and private practice later in life on the Shelf what are some good smart thinking books your commit all Joseph Douglas you are you're asking good questions some good smart thinking books I would recommend okay the 4-Hour Work week is really good but Tim Ferriss that is giving you a very interesting insight into productivity and what he means Happy by Derren Brown is good about changing the way you think to be a happier person and be less reactive than negative events in life what else does a book by Derek sivers hold anything you want which is all about lessons for entrepreneurs but I think it just like life lessons that apply to everyone that's what you get that's what I can think of off the top of my head but the video at some point can we get into Cambridge off to mbbs what does what does that mean how long do you expect that usually vlogging ordering YouTube forever I guess it's refund it's going quite well might as well are you planning to develop apps if I have a good idea for something that will benefit like medical community then I would it how to start reading if you get a Kindle books fiction can people be fiction because they seem to enjoy it fiction off the reading fix nothing. The same category as watching TV watching watching movies and stuff I think it's slightly more worthwhile but yeah I've been reading nonfiction person that wants to people do you think you know it all would you benefit from someone else telling you what the research is on how to be happy or how to improve your memory a little. Kind of stuff so then reading nonfiction is not about reading because you love it it's about reading because you want to you want to get some insight from people that have spent years and years of their lives researching important things that you think we're going to be like that then reading it is in the hospital morning routine before an exam got up have breakfast DD, there's nothing you can do the morning in terms of extra wax so you might as well just kill shot two mates what fiction books to enjoy mistborn molting process I'm reading the Name of the Wind of the sequel to the wise man's fear the moment does come to mind your body more because my group was more legit Olivia says love you what a good books to read for medical school what do you mean books to read medical school give me like medical books read me like no medical books or what favorite TV show Game of Thrones definitely do you ever regret starting medicine at Cambridge Yankee Doodle futurematic spreadsheet have been a long time so I used a lot for the 50 exams I didn't really use it much this year exams because I started quite late to do during regen properly which is why the spreadsheet out of wood read Amy cervini pictures not the same as watching TV stuff like she will do whatever talk about in bingen something on Netflix with my brother about this he very much supports the watching TV Google and Ike 10 support the reading books a better angle go to TV shows to make you think I don't know what the medicine did you write get ranked in medical school we used to get right now in undergrad we don't really get officially ranked anymore the personal put your nose to the top of the Arab people to get distinctions know that they're in the top 15 to 18% the rest of us plebs don't really know what ranking is and what course he studied at Oxford and needed Maths for 4 years graduated and now he's working at a startup in London nested nest.com he's doing like data science machine learning stuff what Apple apps do you use so many so many to come in about the scholarship at Cambridge okay everyone always asks especially people from abroad especially people from the subcontinent from Indian Pakistan everyone has this thing but I want to get a scholarship to study medicine at Cambridge and that was what my mom and to say when I was younger and living in Pakistan and stuff East be like oh you know if you can get a scholarship to study in medicine at Cambridge. That's like the dream unfortunately there is no such thing as a scholarship to study medicine at Cambridge for the most part they're very very very few it's available those are not offered by the university that offered by private organizations or governments or whatever so the Singaporean government office Little People scholarships to come to Cambridge to study medicine and not subject I've got two friends from Pakistan Hugo an inch scholarship off of light and there were like four hundred people that applied to it people go engineering engineering scholarship to study Engineering in Cambridge that was provided by the University scholarships International students you need to get the scholarship from yeah it's just a mess that you know you can just apply for a scholarship in A Few Good Men you'll get it you need to look into it a lot more what's available in your country as financially expensive that will pay for the Senate of fish burger in the McDonald's drive-thru tonight or maybe some chips or maybe like some juice I don't know thank you very much.. So that's where you find what's your favorite movie do you have a favorite director ivylove personal and stuff and since getting into videography and things I want to come to re-watch all of the crystalline film was because I think now would be able to appreciate more about what goes into than what makes makes the directing how do you get talking to Foster Charlie Morgan I've lived in front of a computer Cynthia 7 so feel like between the S7 and 13 and actually at you eat pretty much every day since the age of 11 I spent at least like 8 hours from the computer like my whole life is just happen to the Time video nasty videos coming out I filled one with a guy who knows what he's talking about bfp with a guy who's writing a book about Aunt pay on that will be released at some point in July by then because July is when people ready personal statement with matching would you have to take the RV program if you were still at school the address medicine can transfer it to Cambridge do you know any Sanders medical how well yes I know one his name is Georgia I think he fit in quite well known when he realized that he wasn't from Cambridge because when we get to clinical school and not no one knows each other anyway cuz in an undergrad you very much kind of stuck here on College and your intersection table and you don't really get to know the rest then in 40-yard suddenly won't lose any people to get to know so you ain't very easy for an external person to fit in quite nicely so you ain't go any scholarship at Cambridge know there is no such thing as a scholarship at Cambridge for the most part you know people are going to Cambridge from State schools 60% State School admission thing but that includes grammar school so I went to State grammar school I know other people are going from State schools how does the Post at the top of the Year know they're on unofficially rent the president of the Year generally get some kind of price so they'll get an email from the dean saying congratulations you've won this you know Rudy manhood price for being ranked first in the air so that's how they would know they wouldn't know because there's a number anyway please can you talk about the UK MLA I'm going to make a video about the UK I was at the Cambridge faculty day that's about it a few weeks ago where they were talking about that you came today because quite a few of the Cambridge members are on this on the board that both set write the exam questions for you, so right now I think what's on the website is what's going on at this point basically is going to be like the USMLE exam the every final year cartoon takes probably written exam for me multiple choice in a final year and that might determine like national rankings and stuff we don't really know the full details of that yet what's your favorite sport badminton I service like tennis but I love Scotch scotchy sardonic everywhere has squash courts. I love how do you have to be tennis I think until you get to a decent standard which I wasn't a lot of the time all the time you spend in a serving into the net or you know sitting out and then grabbing a bowl and not waste a little time and I'm until I feel like I should have got really good and I didn't quite get the level of the university and because then I wasn't playing that regularly I think I have lost interest have been damaged as a sport but squash because I started at University I was very much in the state that doesn't have an amazing would highly recommend is not Friday how do I vs. Cambridge Imagine X nationalities it's pretty actually like also to nationalities had to like someplace like Imperial nucl it's less diverse in Pearland UCL and Kings absolutely full of brown people Cambridge has lots of brown people but not as many as imperial nucl black people three Chinese people live Chinese people's does Americans that singaporeans but yeah what OK Isabella's what do you think about UK students going abroad to Eastern Europe to study medicine what is telemedicine ammolite compared to other colleges says hfl Berry is that we always work very well together and there are few people people like pull people like most people he was regarded as like and I held in very high esteem by the wrestler kind of sharing his notes and not eating people stuff that's one thing we go am quite happy to share notes and then we've got cuz I would like you know we got like the polls in the Emma is he like know everything and then I know why people like Callum Jake male who really really good I would be very happy to convict and stuff and it has gotten me Anton 7 world where we are going to work together very nicely and we're all happy to share things and I'm quite tacky so I like organizing us to do shared people dachshund shed spreadsheets and stuff collaborate I see something about it works pretty well there's not there's not that much into college in truck College competition where is that from what I've heard and does BMO conversation at some colleges they rank he within your intelligent have decided that's not very nice for the people I'm not in that system but yeah I'm a pretty good Bunch what are you currently reading I am currently reading a book by Stephen King called on writing I think or how write something along those lines so that's what I'm reading in bed when I wake up my condole and then nonfiction and then what is one of the thing for the gym is the wise man's fear by Patrick rothfuss Chelsea says hi yeah what one piece of advice would you get for writing a personal statement don't stop with the introduction what's my video about it we're like 10 of my friends and weighed in on tips on how to write a personal statement so yeah that's what I would recommend to describe a tissue go ask the question says what do you think is the difference between the best person doing your course compared to you so I know the people who rang for a second I think in general is a function of natural intelligence plus exam technique Plus and kind of your knowledge base kind of overlap Soul the oldies 3 so the people who do very well I think compared to me are slightly more intelligent as well. I think for a lot of Cambridge Medix like we're we're all fairly even in terms of intelligence. Scandal to be a factor I think what they do that I don't is that obviously they work harder than I do kind of the story I tell myself is that I want to do all the things of my time other than just medicine and therefore I don't put as much time into medicine as I could because I want to do things like websites are YouTube on the other end if if I really wanted to and I really put in the hours then I could probably do quite well by myself when you're when you're in the realm of like near the top 50 people in the other two and then become a specific especially medicine very much a case of the Milwaukee put in and the more smart will keep it in the better you'll perform your exams in a subject like math so physics or engineering you can get people that are absolutes of on tops of geniuses Reed davidi naturally good at maths and they won't have to do much work to do to get out of there and my brother know some people in that position where is other people have to work really really really hard to understand the concepts so that's the case for those kind of thinking subject much more of a it's much more grunt work too much more of a grinder the more work you put into it the better your results will be out of it type 1 diabetic stomach medicine at Cambridge with question actually don't I know one of my friends want to grab was a type 1 diabetic I don't know of anybody medicine but to be honest if anyone did have type 1 they wouldn't broadcast and all I know is that no one that I'm very close you have type 1 diabetes are you Hawaii hurricane will I like my going to take lithium Seymour do you annotate for pleasure we all do actually why Kendall of the Kindle app on the iPad does the Kindle have a nicer screen and it's easy to read in bed and it looks more like paper and it hurts it's less painful knee on the eyes that's why I don't like reading in bed because the backlight is very strong and doesn't let me go to sleep for a Tuesday even with not shift had done all that stuff so that would be why I ready what camera do you use it's all Linked In the video description so if you've expanded description you can send it to my email yeah well I mean what I'm eating at the moment is Sony a 6500 with a sigma 16mm 1.4 DC DN lens of it on it and a rode videomic Pro Plus attach the top connectivity Elgato cam link to the laptop laptops Macbook Pro 13 inch 2015 model if any of that means anything to anyone if you have to know the college would be good question Baker Baker Jr I'd probably go either Downing or Queens what kind of medicine is easy to get into because Cambridge has twice as many students at Oxford has more of a kind of brand name even Cambridge dose therefore I think this is the best students would apply to Oxford because it's in terms of international brand recognition easy to get into a Jack Jack says I'm a second-year medical student Volta and tips to get into the foundation programme in the UK one of the doctors in Kingsland at the moment is from Ulta tips Kansas Foundation program already done what all depression Chelsea says what are you most looking forward to about being a junior doctor and what he was driving so I think what I'm most looking forward to is kind of a species of sounds is is is to helping people bit like I kind of got a bit of a taste of that vibe that YouTube thing one and if it's really really nice getting thank you messages from people Instagram email and stuff and that makes me feel like what I'm doing is very worthwhile on from speaking to all the junior doctors they say that it's just the best thing ever went to Patient thanks you for giving them good care and some teams have been on a placement for the past three years either there's like a very good vibe all the Juniors get on the nurses get on the Run has been Advanced the consultant the cool being a thing I hope I'm looking forward to it things and I'm dreading I don't know anything about it this part of me that stinking kind of how hard can it be I'm kind of concerned by the things everyone is concerned about so for example qtm locations what if there's an emergency someone's bleeding out in front of me and I freeze and I don't know what to do but that's kind of oil. for helping you can do that do you believe in natural intelligence yes absolutely I studied intelligence of the topic in 31 psychology is my integrated degree and that was my favorite thing that I've read a lot about study I like the research on intelligence and IQ and things like that the definitely is a very very strong genetic component to it yeah people who are intelligent don't really have anyone to thank for that other than the parents for providing good genes and for giving them an environment for those the Elon Musk biography is pretty

Is the absolute key to everything in my opinion because when you learn when you try and make money from a hubby it means that a during a heavy with the world you want just sitting in your room enjoying your kind of putting a drawings out there and that helps develop your confidence your skills and just add value to the world another good thing so that's one benefit of trying to make money from you work so I can leave work at 4 it makes you focus proving it to the level where someone would think Edna Valley to the love to give you money for it so for example I do a lot of did a lot of close-up magic back in the day and one big thing in the magic Community is that you got a lot of people kind of know it's sitting in the bedroom like me who practiced what time we're in front of the camera and like sleight-of-hand all these times he called moves and stuff but they never go and perform in the real world and if you have this in the back of your mind but I want to make money for my hubby if you have in the back of your mind I want to make money from Magic then you stop putting yourself out there you start you know offering us restaurants in volunteering at places in Pontiac bookings and that helped to develop as a magician under the person on do dubbed confidence in public speaking in all of these things in order to have a productive summer make money from it and I think about already buddy help you were you ever in the magic circle know I wasn't I've been to the motorcycle few times election stuff Intuit I was intending to audition for it but I've kind of let the magic Fall by the wayside little bit recently I want us all to get back into it I might like you're like a little show on YouTube or something at some point but I get back into it then I'll probably join a motorcycle okay Cassian caption says you have any recommendations people in their thirties looking to make a career change and become a doctor and seem to love it and actually my experience from the products has been that grout medic some much more much more clued-up about everything their social skills are much better than hello more life experience and they're much more than they care much more about medicine good doctors where is undergrads we kind of decided at the age of 16 they're going to be when we talked to this kind of Follow You Follow the yellow brick road that was laid out in front of us so I think there's a lot to be said for joining medicine as when you're older perspective I think it will be makes you better doctor because you had a little life experience a little guy from America that I was on the left of the woods we just happened to be in the same in the same hospital he did like journalism for 10 years before applying to med school in the US is Cambridge hospital in terms of composition question some people say that can be but I think competition is right depending on how you view competition if you want it if your aim is to get is to be over there then is that of course it's going to be hostile until the competition in a while because you will be thinking that overcomes off the air if you're a man then it becomes I think I've got it on my Kindle and I think I read like the first half and I ended up losing interest I need to try and read it again because I've been coming across again and again and recommended reading list but General concept what temperature should I put on my extracurricular activities and applying for Cambridge and UCL okay Li & Fung Cambridge don't really care about you after activities UCL do so I think the reason for doing it for quick right it should already be that'll help you get into University because that's going to help you in your whole life in general so you can develop skills that will help you in the rest of your life that's really a very important thing to do when you're in school because you have so much free time when you're in school that you can just pick some and get ready to go to that you can just decide to learn how to code and within a year you can become very pretty good at that because you have so much time to put into it stuff like that the benefits your whole life so do gcc's Reynosa the whole thing if your top of the year would you place be placed higher than someone lower down at a higher rank University if you're referring to the foundation job applications then yes it's within your own yogurt what's your personal philosophy towards competition to Sarah competition I think I treated as a game so if my friends get better marks in Maine some of my friends sell my friends than me because they work for this afternoon. I like to think it's more appreciate that Honda I think it's more my level ssss Scimitar work ethic some of the level of nobody working that much if they get time off to me. I feel kind of disappointed we love playing board games competition got very stressed out my competition I don't get stressed out by in the slightest because I don't regard it as just a game and how are you concentrate on YouTube in 2018 with the amount of people already here attempting to make money. What is the opportunity on YouTube in 2018 it's a I think that would have prevented me from doing it I just kind of went for it and I also knew that there weren't that many people doing specifically medical stuff in the UK the running time for the people and the people that were doing it we're not doing it usually consistently and the production value was not was not great I think at the time I was looking into this. Medic who at the time was called London diary of some of that he was probably the biggest I think my friend jadera was doing it so that was supposed to rinse rice I've never really seen any kind of Junior doctor vloggers and my theory I lost this time last year when I was in July. and I saw it as a kind of untapped market so I didn't really think that was not saturated and the angles never to make money from YouTube that was took out of my content and I didn't expect you make money at home for about 8 months you might as well so yeah and therefore I don't really care about the competition or about the situation in the market is there such a thing as intelligence or is it just time spent working the absolutely is such a thing as intelligence four subjects like medicine intelligence only gets you so far because then you get to this wall where you just have to learn content but things like math intelligence rehabs that's what stuff what storage iPad Pro do you have how do you cope with stress and pressure against rest I'll feel much pressure I think the reason I think a reason for that is partly growth mindset party knowing that whatever happens in the exams I'm going to be alright the world is still going to keep turning the sun will still rise tomorrow it's not that big a deal and I kind of like I kind of forgot failure is letting opportunities or that's what I tell myself at least that worried about failing because I know I know it will be done enough work to cost at least so yeah TV series well is it coherent to go with pre-med course without investigating those years should I apply for medicine I'm ready to pass in that scenario I think if you like the idea of medicine you should just go to Medicine stay off from what I've heard from people who've done pre-med it's amazingly useful it's good being at University of longer and having a fee if you do use that time to expand your horizons and take art classes and do interesting things but most people that I know who done pre-med have this dream that I'm going to take off I'm going to take some computer coding classes and programming to do this this and this and that and they just end up getting sucked into this pre-med thing of like biology and like stuff and end up not doing that stuff if you're not doing that. I think we medicine appointments I don't know anything about it so does Kmart offer Foundation course medicine know how do you get place until guess I'll try for one rankings I was thinking plastic surgery initially then maybe up into the plastic surgery again kind of worried about stocks medical school in September worried anything recommend to read why are you worried about there aren't many British Dental School what is one specialty you wouldn't go into I don't think I would want to go into Psychiatry and I don't see myself doing it. can you see Visions when studying medicine at Cambridge you get stuff is very nice to the situation and they like right today let's talk about this and you talk about how do I take notes from a textbook do you want to take notes from a textbook Agora Tom favorite car I drive a Nissan note telling it's pretty cool if I have the money at how much time do you spend studying in a day a varies depending on whether I have a safe in general I don't read book how's the weather do stuff I think like when your when your clinical Medicare just when you're in the hospital and you're asking you questions and stuff so you don't really need to spend time studying leaving so much how to take to write a personal statement ofc ages I went through about 16 drops of it what are using to Nissan Leaf you said you want to take notes from a textbook for important stuff but why do you want to take notes in the first place one is right questions for yourself or whatever worry about quality don't worry about cameras don't worry about microphone stuck stuff can come later if you decide you enjoy it then you keep going with it are you going to have a really crazy schedule when you become an F1 says-a-me it's pretty hectic normal working day is half past 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening and every abnormal working days longer than that just like what is that average about 10 hours a day for 5 days the concept if you need to revise then you will if you want to avoid you realize they're wasting aggravation Fun by tracing as a game fitting is like like you know testing yourself just like coming by Fun Laura videos YouTube how do you learn when you make videos you just naturally get better at video editing and he spend some of your free time watching other people's blogs and watching how they edit and bushing editing tutorials on YouTube then you not to get better at hitting so he's just doing a little bit of a Time videos depending on the type of content sometimes I like watching a video format sometimes I like listening to it in podcast. I've written an email about this so if you look in the video description there's a link to my weekly email newsletter article. I think number to email number two on the list you can read it on a Lincoln there it's called motivation is a myth interesting articles that I always go back to whenever I think about motivation does a very good one on the website was domination that's called screw motivation what you need is discipline the idea of motivation is like erroneous assumption that in order to do something you have to feel like doing it where as you know in reality if you want to do something or if you need to do something and then your feelings about that are completely inconsequential all this should be completely inconsequential if you have to go to work do you feel like I do work you will that work how how you feeling on the date does not match result equally with things like realizing for exams going to the gym or any unpleasant thing that we should do then we the audio City buffet we just eliminate our feelings from this in the slightest we do it because we need to do it we don't do it because we feel like doing it and motivation and trying to get motivation is a very temporary Russia temporary hit that tells us the okay now right now I'm going to feel like studying whereas we should be trying to do is to tell him that I found you can read more about it in my email newsletter so I can have breast reconstruction or no broken hand. It's not just boob jobs and nose jobs in cosmetic surgery I quite like the Reconstruction site of thing you like giving people their organs back at school okay, you know what is coming and feeling the need to revise the first you're now I have to drive it after me what would you recommend an hour ago don't worry about getting specific knowledge cuz it won't make any difference. Which days you should develop like learning techniques you should get familiar with using Anki and you should start thinking about okay if I wanted to me how would I make Anki decks Anki flashcards for learning you get familiar with things like at the Regal State reputation categorization these useful revision techniques you can find more info and my videos you can find more info in the book make it stick getting good effective study techniques is going to be the single biggest thing okay medical school that's pretty much nothing you can do now that will help you later on. I suppose you could try and lie to me in advance but you know how to contact out of the context of medical school everyone else will catch up to you within like 2 days like this also just going to focus on getting good at learning how to study and then you'll delete it play the team company I see everyone everyone's do that just to make a course register the company make website don't you don't need to do anything fancy but he don't need a team you can do it okay I think this has been quite a while I've no idea how long we've been going on for over an hour. So I think we're going to wrap things up here thank you very much for watching everyone this is been fun I hope value of this yeah it's been good I think we'll do one next Tuesday as well maybe I think I might make a quick thing if you haven't yet you might like to subscribe to my weekly email newsletter that's basically I send an email every Sunday sometime Sunday morning sometime Sunday evening with a few thoughts about stuff on like some articles that I discovered that week that you did quite short but yeah you can check them out LinkedIn to describe other than that thanks very much good luck for your exams and stuff I think of you so they have exams left so yeah thanks again going to do some like kind of practice now going to try and play this is me and goodbye"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew here my name is LA on the final year medical student at Cambridge University this video we're going to be talking about 12 tips that might help you if you notice about your upcoming medicine interviews a few things to begin with Leslie this town was not hit a thousand subscribers switches thank you very much if you are a subscriber if you're not then thank you for watching video anyway but please consider subscribing those button just down underneath the video so if you have any questions about medicine or if you got any suggestions for videos that we could be doing please leave a comment down below and I will definitely get back to you about what to do if action is the antidote I want about you to set the other day is here if you are anxious about the interviews don't worry too much because everyone has some level of anxiety some level of nerves about the medicine interview but if you want of us about it and then the best thing you can do is prepare a look for it and if and I think the best way of doing that by far is by just doing loads and loads of mulch practice interviews with your friends or family your teachers if you know any doctors get them to give you some more interview questions but ultimately the more you can get used to sitting someone almost four people and talking about like your motivation to take medicine all these kinds of standard interview questions give me the wrong perspective on what to do if you nervous I want thing you see that's a fairly common saying this. Everyone is nervous about it and everyone recommends practicing a lot of mock interviews but hopefully you'll find some useful tips that you can use if you want of us about them so as usual timestamps everything done delivering the description and I'm just going to run through the 12 tips and then I will see you at the end for the Cossacks like comment subscribe on to cool see you shortly and when you turn off they know you're going to be nervous and everything to be a single person who walks in who is going to act like they do on a daily basis this is a weird strange situation spending and they are aware of that I understand that they can be incredibly nerve-wracking I mean even with all the preparation I had I was very nervous beforehand I may have cried off of it and just remember that I want have doesn't want you to do well Cambridge particularly within the college's when they pick you for interview they picked you for a reason is because they see potential in you anywhere that you can pick for an interview because they kind of keep in touch with me. We could really do it I hate you trying to trip you out but they really want to see you do well it because they want to walk with you that can make you feel better when you go in the oven if you don't have the confidence fake it until you make it because it's learning how to pretend that what you really believe it and brightness button not knowing what's going to happen to them Annie's is not knowing what's going to happen and that's very important interviews cuz you don't know what they're going to ask you do you know why medicine the life why does medical school Wi-Fi but they could ask you anything do you want to be able to not panic realize that you know what you should calm down what they Austin like decide how you can answer atoll in the minority has things. I would just say the more practice you got the more you're used to putting yourself in a slightly uncomfortable situation that will help you a lot in the long run nice process is well actually it is good to be able to show that I actually enjoy being able to talk about why you want to do this amazing thing I think the more practice you do the more you realize that it's not really that hard and I think watching videos like this one and if you look up if you look on the title rebuilt videos of medical students answering interview questions hopefully that will show you that these ions isn't that hard like everyone gets for example why medicine everyone worries about this thinking that they have to make something new something exciting for one medicine but you can pretty much just say I like science and I want to help people on top of the acceptable I think ya on a on a particle level as well make sure you're the best place you can be on for the interview so make sure you get enough sleep the night before have a good breakfast make sure you're wearing are you comfortable with things that everyone will be reading everything thing going to Medical interview and also I think taking things step-by-step says not thinking about what's going to happen when I get the result what's going to happen if I don't get in just take things day by day going to go to this interview I'm going to try my best I'm not going to think about the result because I think when you start thinking about results are things you think about play time after interview polite and they are on your side so if you're passionate about medicine it just about ready passionate hobby that you really want to do be safe safe is nothing you can often tell that they the twos we have here so you can tell if you have prepared for an interview especially impressed when people that coached is more are you comfortable will you do yourself Justice and abuse testing so if you've never ever flustered cute do you still want a chelating yourself but not will guys such a long way in the real thing they'll probably come up with some of the same stuff that is lodged in tissues is what as well say the more comfortable you can make yourself in an interview season save the way I see myself. I speaking to friends family whoever would really listen I'm just about my subject about missing having sex casual conversations about that so that I was used to speaking in that way used to talk about it so that it wasn't completely I need when I get done up and have to do it and I guess just making sure you know if you read through your passing statement a few times you know you are going to have to defend what you're going to so you didn't save as long as you pass then you can be as calm as possible and it will be scary but not swell so much fun you're my enemies I think really entertaining about the time meeting 6 to 10 people and having to make a first impression because Ballymena people so I can play embrace the title of the fact that I've ever ran in straight I was going to walk into a room with a random stranger and have five minutes to to make them laugh and make them want me I only want to make sure you're human if that makes sense so the right mindset that you're going to enjoy this. You can do this you've got this and you prepared then I don't need any reason to be nervous just to reiterate firstly everyone is nervous about the medicine interviews so you're definitely not alone and secondly make sure you just do those in those interviews with your friends I find that the by far the best way of combating these nerves and hopefully you've got some tips to even refer you as well and as usual timestamps down below prep and other things about life as a medical student as well which you may find Vega interesting about"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel and to another study with me video isn't that exciting as usual I'll be taking you through a day off work or I'm studying for medical exam code MRCP I'll be sharing my study techniques along the way for whatever it's worth I actually set my alarm for 7 a.m. because I wanted to seem like a motivational and productive member of society I turned it off and went back to bed until half past 9 then got up and spend an hour having a shower replying to some emails in the toilet and then cleaning the house because obviously the house needs to be cleaned before I can start doing any work from 45 I decide to start studying and because I've already made a list of all the subjects my exam I decide to tackle my weakest one and that's neurology to having decided that step one is to scope the subject I find out what all the various topics are within the subject and categorize them in book categories using a mind map it's not way I've got the big picture of you in my mind the skeleton of the contents so that when I come across new bit so I know exactly where they slow into the big picture I make this mind map partly from a set of notes I found on the internet and partly from a presentation that one he is in college gave us a shout out to Martha for the amazing teaching session view of all of Neurology and so I take a quick break and spend half an hour chatting to my grandma in Pakistan that bicycling what a wonderful grandson I am from Newnan Flatbush three questions on pause metzen an online question bank that everyone uses for medical exams in the UK I select Justin Urology questions cuz that's what I'm doing today and I wasn't going through them I'm turning everything I get wrong or everything that's new to me into a flash card on Anki I'm going to a bit more detail because this is basically my whole strategy for past paper questions in the world of productivity doesn't audio cold quick capture for example if you're building an effective to do list or note taking system you want to be able to capture any idea you have quickly and efficiently Apple notebook you using for example lots of to-do list apps have keyboard shortcuts that you can use to Quick capture an idea as it comes to you or do you send stuff from other apps to your to-do list the point is that they should be so quick and easy to do that you might get stuff out of your brain and into your system to I've taken this idea and I've applied it to Revision in the past I used to just bash three questions and read through explanations what questions are done wrong but as you might know if you've watched my evidence-based study tips videos the two most important effective studying are number one active recall add a number to spaced repetition flashcard software like a monkey and quiz that has both of these Concepts built into it but a big reason why people don't like using flashcards absolutely ages to make your own flashcards now you could just downloaded from the internet but those tend to be less effective and about less customized than making your own and in my opinion The Best of Both Worlds is to make your own flashcards but to make the process of making them a super super quick so my technique for going through online boxes to use split screen to answer the questions on one side and then if I get something wrong or find some new information in the explanations I'll copy and paste it straight into a donkey and turn it into a big flashcard oven review those flashcard fairly regularly so that overtime anything that was new to me question Bank gets uploaded to my brain I'll talk about this in more detail in a bit but first at around 1 p.m. I decide to take a break and practice some Japanese on Rosetta Stone who a very kindly sponsoring this video Rosetta Stone full Misty year now and I love how it makes language learning into a game and rather than teaching you the grandma and stuff in the driveway it integrates those into the scenario so you can figure out sentence structures and vocabulary along the way it was a girl really cool voice recognition that checks your nation of words and phrases so you can try and sound a bit more like a native speaker and installing using Rosetta Stone I found myself using my new Japanese killed in day-to-day life for example just before playing squash I might say to my opponent motion interpret a CT scan at work I might drop a Cheeky Monkey kill showing them anyway if he fancies any language you should definitely check out Rosetta Stone and you can use my code in the video description below to get 50% off any subscription plan especially if you're going away somewhere interesting over the summer happy quite fun use of your time to try and learn the language before you get there anyway with that said let's get back to studying for the next couple of hours I continue to bash through online questions and quick capture every piece of new information in time if I come across anything that's my best to understand before I shove it into Anki for memorization by the way if you wondering why I'm using Anki rather than Quizlet it's because well Quizlet has a pretty a design and putting stuff in Tanki is a lot faster than in putting it into Quizlet and because this method relies on quick capture to generate flashcards efficiently value speed of input for more than prettiness of design around 3 p.m. I decide I'm going to be a complete waste man for a few hours and so I watch some YouTube videos including Neil Gaiman commencement speech video which is pretty solid and research some recipes for overnight oats me to take a trip to waitrose and bison ingredients cuz I'm a guy when I get home at about 5 p.m. and I spend the next half an hour editing a video which gives me a bust of energy that I can use to sustain myself while studying until dinner time at 5:30 at spend some time converting the sketched out in urology syllabus I made in the morning organized set of total list on notion my new favorite note taking this further reinforces the skeleton of the subjects in my head it also means that when I come across something that's particularly new or tricky I can copy and paste it into notion at the same time as making a flash card this means that overtime I bill Bank of copy-pasted notes for anything I found difficult to speed revision section I can Blitz through each subject and try my best to actively recall the contents of each topic by the way in case anyone is wondering why I copy and paste notes rather than writing them myself is because I consider has to be a complete waste of time especially in the subject like medicine where others have already done the work for me there's absolutely no point Reinventing the wheel and the evidence from hundreds of Studies have shown that summarizing content is a very inefficient study technique and absolutely sucks in comparison activerecord and spaced repetition I'll talk about this a lot more in my evidence-based study tips video series which will be linked down below from the 615 Old were the reviews and more questions apartments in and quick capture everything in Tanki and notion I just thought I want to change of scenery so I allowed on the sofa Genelia is that while doing all the studying I've got my study with me public playlist on Spotify playing through my Amazon Echo speakers starting at sponsored and so I'm hearing banging instrumentals from films TV shows and games to keep myself entertained as I study again according to the playlist individual description if you want to check it out at 7 p.m. my friend Jake walks up to the house and we decide to bash through some of the Anki questions together cuz he's also taking the mocp we used to do this back when we were in medical school together with her other friends so it's a nice throwback activity and the right to be otherwise very monotonous day from 8 p.m. I decide to change things up a bit and do some hematology for half an hour and then at 8:30 I decide of had enough of studying for one day and so I watch some YouTube videos on till some friends arrive for Game of Thrones night but take away from GDK see us through the episode and so ends this study with me video I hope you found at least partly useful I'll definitely make a video talking more about the quick capture auntie auntie technique in a lot more detail if you go any other questions please do leave them in a comment below and I'll do my best to reply to ever if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribe to the channel yet then please consider doing so thank you for watching my cheeky I got there cuz I'm has to Rosetta Stone video and I'll see you in the next one so you'll Nora"

            "text": " welcome to WWDC Apple unveiled at this year's WWDC iPad OS and I'd like to give you a first look and it seems like he's making the iPad more of a replacement for your microwave I'm at least going to be timestamps in the video description and independent come on over here so you can skip around the video if you feel like it new iPad OS has Aldi's split screen features built into a lecture or in a fault and I'm pretending to take notes on one window but then I'm browsing Reddit or something in the other window not quite that you skate that had in mind is probably not quite the sort of thing that the new features help you out with we're going to finally be able to plug in external drive into the iPad that's right thumb drives external disk drives and SD cards because I'm very cheap Lightroom and now you can that's going to be a game-changing I think that's going to mean that the iPad replace is my laptop for a lot of my photo editing workflow texturizing is kind of a bit of a Bullock on the iPad at the moment is a little bit it makes it more legit for actually writing stuff and not being a little bit frustrated every time you write down that phone number for an iPad everything is about having the right mindset in the principal but also it's about having the right tactics to efficiently do things and be able to save time switching to it for everything everything I do in my iPod is a bit less efficient than doing the same thing on a MacBook keyboard shortcuts that's awesome that might become a bit closer to what performances like on a MacBook Pro in terms of efficiency of action economy of motion listen to stop leaks on a keyboard shortcuts on emo people should use keyboard shortcut Tomorrow full desktop web browsing is coming to Safari any difference in the most part unless you doing something like find a website for example with ghosts or WordPress or Squarespace if I want to edit my post into a do it to the extent it'll be a lot more possible to make website changes on the Fly stuff like that ultimately there is the new sidecar feature that's being introduced to iPad OS onto Macos Catalina 7 ways to do this in the past using things like duet so that's never quite worked perfectly to the point that I've always tried these things out and never really stuck to them I'm hoping that once this new side coffee tickets out of then I'll be able to take the MacBook take the iPad down in the library or the coffee shop and get this really cool like Viber I'm like in a doing stuff here doing stuff here and get this and feel like a bit more of a done a bit more of a bus for having these two displays new iPad OS I'm with the new iOS you'll be able to connect two different pairs of airpods to watch the same thing anoscopy Next Level cuz you can be you know sitting on the sofa together or snuggling up in bed or whatever floats your boat may be sitting on an airplane and watching the same thing that's pretty cool for me at the moment because I don't have anyone to share experience with you know when I get married and I convince my future wife to get another pair of airpods will be able to have these IQ till date nights we're both sitting on the sofa and watching something on an iPad on the train and go somewhere together and she's going to head resting on my shoulders that's another thing that maybe once the new iPad OS comes out and as soon as I will be right here giving my thoughts and unsolicited opinions about how the iPad fit into my life so thank you very much for watching the video please give it a thumbs up"

helping the copter general surgery placement and that means every morning at half past 7 we have a border around with the Consultants when everyone on the team gets together when we discuss every patient on our list and turn let's say the patient in bed 18a needs to have the chest drain removed I'll be watching Bosch Stephanie remove Electric station 23 needs a gastro referral to the patient bed 25 needs to be booked for an endothermic change and that's a the patient that 26 is going home and therefore needs a t t o and a discharge plus productivity system is that when you turn it into a plus so for example Etc move this chest drain I would turn that into a + that's a the two units a transfusion of going going up tonight and go Plus and the cool thing about this into a bucket which is it is being pushed back a little triangle that would be the notation for bits of information does the second method that I used to keep track of such and talks and this is a method used by patient needs to have a blood test I would switch to the red pen and I'll be doing a little box next to the bed number which means they need to have bloods requested and I would do a half shading which means they've been physically taken and then finally once I've looked at the blood results and acted on what I mean I would do at full shading and this lets me keep track of the patient's blood test as the day progresses teach a two flag of certain things so usually in visits Hospital Urgent I would highlight to any of them and that's quite easy to do which reminds me to hand over at the end of the day so this is all well and good but you might be wondering very reasonably how something like an iPod fits in with data protection regulation and here is how information on it send a test that has to be written secondly I've installed all of my hospitals various enterprise-level security certificates on this iPad which means if it ever gets lost it can be remotely wiped by the Admin team encrypted and secured with a even the FBI contract for nothing that I do that involves any kind of patient or anything like that is ever sync to iCloud and this is the reason why I'm using good notes turn off the iCloud sync so that the only copy of this data is stored on the local device and finally our tree every document on goodnotes as I would a physical hand over sheet that doctors all around the world Hughes shredded in Benson right to do whatever means I never have any play of storing patient to do list to discuss this with the senior management team at my hospital who are quite happy with using the iPad in this way because it's so easy to lose a list and hospitals around the UK have been fined hundreds of thousands of pounds for ducted accidentally leaving a patient list in like the local sandwich bar or in the cafe downstairs it's so easy to lose a piece of paper it's so much harder to do so one of the great things about what he in Cambridge is that my hospital was the first one in the UK to go completely paperless way back in 2014 the way it works is that when you're connected to Wi-Fi you Logan by the hospital's apparently Ultra Mega super secure internal type system physically handicapped general surgery placement that fought with me which I do every single day then I'll just look into the system on the iPad and so the consultancy the patient squat by the bedside to get out of my lap and I type of the notes any means of access to things like that a much more efficient way of running the world round myself off and using an iPad to look stuff up very quickly well so I can't remember the dose off the top of my head I'm going to look it up in the British national then we'll give you the indication the dose and all the various interactions that drug so you can see if it's safe to go station Alafaya come across a drug or disease and I can't quite remember what it is or what it does look it up on Wikipedia oh my God I can't believe doctors use Wikipedia what is the world coming to the amazing obviously if it's 8 mission-critical thing like a treatment algorithm for someone having a heart attack right now or treatment algorithm for someone having a stroke I'll be using them don't like the nice guidelines which is the National Institute for clinical Excellence or something like bmj best practice which is an evidence-based Subscription Service offered by the British medical journal absolutely nothing wrong with using something like Wikipedia to refresh my memory and the great thing about using the iPad for that is that they're like what's going on is unprofessional no one is thinking that you're there texting your friends even though you could be an iMessage or messenger people are thinking that you're doing well funny moments of downtime when there is nothing really going on reply to some preparing for my postgraduate medical exams the MRCP doing some possible questions online on online question to spend some of my free time when there's nothing if you get the premium membership subscription probably the best productivity theme to channel on YouTube and he's got this like he's talking about all of his methods for maximizing productivity and efficiency safety system if you want to find out more about how I click on the thing over here and that will be a video about 1 my 30 favorite iPad apps which has been

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the block on to yet another study with me video today we're going to be sitting out in the sun in the beautiful garden of our University accommodation so as usual will be doing time lapse of US during work and I'll be hooked Lake planning stuff as we go along maybe giving you some tips on how you can revise for urine exam add a bit of variety to lives we're going to inject some like somatic sequences of us make you lunch and all that sounded stuff so yeah DNA CPR means do not attempt resuscitation I'm about to discussion with a patient in the family we sign this order which means that if the patient's heart stops and if they die we don't attempt CPR to bring them back from the dead this is an important conversation to be able to have and it could have gone I am so we run that snorri a few times with each other home around 11 we worked on assessing a patient's Fitness with discharge. This is where note-taking comes in as I alluded to in the previous study with me video I don't remind making notes if that isn't an easily accessible summary over here and this case that wasn't ready so these are the sorts of notes that I made and I think that there are some good General tips from these first day I think numbers already important us bring up a topic into numbered list is so much more useful than bullet points for explaining it to someone and write the four main things in the Celtic art with bullet points which is often the default that load of us go for and that certainly was the case will be back in the day if you don't get the satisfaction of being able to say that there are four points need to know order of Five Points need to know for this the activities of daily living and we have talked about into 8 different parts but it's normally quite hard to remember like a list of eight without any other Amy Morris so we did was we weave the story about how to remember these things and we thought about it as if an elderly patient is going about that day to the first thing that wake up in the walk to the toilet and then when the in the toilet that I have a shower and change their clothes in the front walk downstairs and a very simple story that lets us remember these this 8 point checklist but to be honest you can try and apply the sort of story to a lot of things where you going to learn a long list of stuff so I remember back when we didn't Jesus he told us a we still have the story of Percy the pebble and Biddy Boulder and let how they be kind of like rolling down the river and introducing the concept the very stiff types of erosion as you went along so having done a couple role plays explain DNA CPL to one another and then have increased the system for how to assess a patient's Fitness discharge we decided to have lunch up here is some slow mo of us making anything clutch what we're having lunch came up to the kitchen and we taught them how to do this Fitness a discharge assessment that we worked on in the morning so I was the one that came up with a little story thing so instead because then I could come over see them and see if there were any holes in her knowledge in that was helping all three of us is that while she was explaining it to Jake she made him generate a lot of the things themselves so instead of saying that okay will be go to a point list and first invitation and it's likely to go to the toilet 70 to have breakfast instead of doing that she made him do like kind of work it out from first principles so she said what's the very first thing that you do when you wake up in the morning I have breakfast at the very first thing you do what's the second thing you do when you get up and he was like well I walked to the toilet and then she would like to fix the walking and going to the toilet of points 2 and 3 are chocolate kind of told them alone rather than just kind of spoon feeding them as well once you've learned something then try your very best to teach someone else it helps you because it helps you consolidate your knowledge because you know something after lunch we decided to run through some history taking real face and then decided to do some palliative care stuff because first day is quite important for real life and secondly we thought he might come up in the exam to the four of us in the room and we brainstormed for different areas of palliative care that we should probably know about and for about 15 minutes picked one of the topics and we made our own kind of notes summary for it and then at the end of the 50 minutes will explain all topics to each other so that we like essentially we crowdsource told another you needed in about a quarter of the time because we stood up the workload and that was very useful way of getting little content into a brains very quickly what happens in the final moments of Life what does it look like when someone is dying I found some pretty good summary on notability my iPad after taking a check list of what it looks like different Elvis Presley because it helps kind of separated by Jimmy on the page and secondly because I like writing a different color than I just make the process of revising and making notes much more pleasant so the others to remember an eight-point list of things to know when someone is dying then it was like if I just done if I put it points in milk given them like a clear idea of how many they have snow studies showing us how to do a Psychiatry risk assessment from someone who has attempted suicide this is a really good video and as I was watching I took some walnuts on my iPad of words and phrases. Don't look at them with using kind of the structure that he was using while he was doing this risk assessment while watching lectures really important because it helps keep me awake otherwise I'm very easy for sleeping lecture like a summary of things that I can look at a later date rather than having to wait a whole video and categorize and systemize things into my little I'm into my own structure and that acts as another key for Rico that I can call upon a delay today while I don't really enjoys note-taking as a revision strategy in itself I think it's really useful to do while have attending a lecture or watching video working since around 10 a.m. and we had a good time with friends but we go to a puddle up then we post a message on a house Facebook Chat that was doing some board games tonight and then people come to my room and we end the day with a solid game of articulate told ya that brings us to the end of another thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the next video like a clothing brand sweet papaya South China Sea"

several days away before the whole coronavirus covet stuff started so when not wearing masks has no social distancing I'm talking about patience but the pace I'm talking about I'm not real they are aggregate patients I assertive I've made up what a representative patient sort of looks like any of these different scenarios which tends to be how most medical journalists and writers and stuff deal with patient confidentiality but also outpatient real patients to meet up but this load of Representatives with those two caveats out of the way I hope you enjoy the video in this video I'll take you through a day in my life as a junior doctor on the Gynecology rotation at West Suffolk Hospital in the east England the day begins at 6:30 a.m. when I wake up shower brush my teeth do we and get dressed at 7 a.m. on drive to work and I usually grab a cheeky oat milk latte from Starbucks on Route I get in at 8 a.m. and change my favorite pair of bright orange and then at 8:05 we start obstetrics hand over with the midwives Obstetricians and anesthetist discuss the ladies we've gotten the labor sweet this is not relevant to me today because at 8:15 we get a hand over from the Gynecology 19 about any patients that we need to see overnight with an ectopic pregnancy so that means a pregnancy growing in one of the Fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus where I should be crying and she's just about to go to the operating theater for a laparoscopy which means the surgeons are going to put a little camera in her abdomen and probably going to remove the tube topic pregnancy is is growing at 8:30 having heard the end of it from the 19 mean the registrar resident if you're American and the consultant or attending if you're American we will head over to the Gynecology ball to see all patients on the ward round-the-world rounded self-involved Steam in their beds finding out how they've been overnights and how they're progressing and having a look at that blood results and observations vital signs to make sure everything's alright already with the ectopic pregnancy is just about to be taken to theater for operation and so we say hello to her and wish her the very best senior house officer Underwood it's usually module to type up the notes at were going around and seeing the patients and thankfully the 10 hours a day that I spent since the age of five sitting in front of the computer speaking to the patients at this point if there's anything I don't understand about the patient's diagnosis investigations management anything like that I just asked the consultant registrar question off we see the patient and they usually very happy to explain things as we go along we finish seeing the three-page around 9 a.m. when the consultant and the registrar leave to go to the labor board to deal with the obstetrics side of things that leaves me Manning the Gynecology Ward along with our team of wonderful nurses and Healthcare assistance for the rest of the day in my job is to deal with any queries that arise in the world sissy patients who come in for a Gynecology review by the emergency department via the general practitioner so it is 10 a.m. she's about eight weeks pregnant and she's going to any because she brought some Growing Pains of pain in the left iliac fossa and also some bright red vaginal bleeding are worried that she might possibly have an ectopic pregnancy and so they took some blood the Gynecology World way we're going to review her vital signs to make sure she's stable and then I see her in a clinic room I take a history to confirm what symptoms she's getting and assess any risk factors for ectopic pregnancy and then with her consent and one of the nurses of The Chaperone to see if there's any tenderness in any particular area and then look inside the vagina with a speculum to check for any signs of bleeding at the neck of the womb all that seems very healthy and normal with no signs of active bleeding until the next step is to get her an ultrasound scan to check how babies where the baby is growing in the right place stop the pain or bleeding again then she can always come back and we can reassess her off seeing this lady on computer system and I got a call from a GP wanting some advice what about those ladies go to the right groin and also she's had some nausea and vomiting over the last few days and especially because this lady already has a known right ovarian cyst surgical assist a benign cyst growing on her right ovary the Jeep is worried that maybe she's got very unfortunate because the ovaries with twisting on itself and that can be really painful in cause nausea and vomiting and I've known to be quite dangerous as if the blood supply to the ovary completely disappears then the ovary can die into a personality about things about the GP to send the rent nice Department as soon as possible and then the guys and girls and Edie are going to stabilize her make sure she's fine juice and blood exclude possible quick coffee in hospital amazing restaurant timeout probably the best in the region apparently people come in like around Christmas time just for The Thundermans pies and Life Hospital this morning having little ketchup the impression plan with restaurant cool trainees involvement middle-grade Obstetrics & Gynecology training at 1 p.m. we get a teaching session about maternal sepsis. Up to a few weeks after 1 but not super helpful and then off to lunch I'm back on the road the lady who the GP sent to A&E with possible ovarian torsion turned out to actually have appendicitis instead and she's been taken care of by the general surgery team after dealing with a couple of more inquiries from GPS a referral from Annie one of The Midwives in early pregnancy assessment unit tells me about a lady she's just seeing who's unfortunately had a miscarriage confirmed on ultrasound pause naturally we can do medical management which involves giving a tablet that encourages the uterus to contract and expel out any pregnancy tissue the stuff behind all the women can Alpha surgical management which involves passing a suction catheter into the uterus under general anesthetic leaving the pregnancy tissue that way I explained the risks benefits of these options and the lady officer medical management So after talking about that in more detail she signed a consent form and we arranged for her to have the tablets on the water chasing the results of the swamp doesn't take too long and so today I end up having around what to spare at the end of the day so it's not about 4 p.m. a GP and A&E baginal discharge runny symptoms of infection will take some swabs using expected him and I will send this hooked up to the lab to be grown and analyzed and we go to see all of these outstanding investigations in and every day we have a look through and see if any results back yet and so does having infection during one of the swabs we can give him a call and say hey from the guy calls you or do you have some smokes taken we've seen that you dispose of grown E coli and so we can do some antibiotics for that and we do can write to the GP and then just grab the antibiotics from the general practice if that's easier for them to check in with the obstetrics on pool team to make sure they're all right and then I sit down and get some extra work done each week I run physiology supervision so first you medical students so if I give a day find the time to sit down with my iPad in a cup of coffee to read through the lecture notes which is quite nice to see you or anything that takes up and over to the obstetric on call Doctor Who is on from 8 in the morning till 9 p.m. at night link website let me film on site"

            "text": " and this video was joking about how starting a blog and putting myself out there on the internet has completely changed my life and how it can do the same for you as I lay on macduff in Cambridge and around five years ago I made the plunge to putting myself out there and started personal blog sense basically my first year of University I knew I wanted to start some kind of block on you I wanted to start writing on the internet but I had all these fears around it that I just could never really quite get over like first day that was a fierce around actually starting writing online in the first place and it looks like you know what the hell am I going to write about why would anyone read what I have to say slowly if my friends and family discovered I've got a personal blog that I've been writing online they're going to make fun of me and they're going to think I'm a terrible person and I had this real barrier to a writing anything which was that there was nothing. that was original I was stuck on this thing of having to be original thinking that you know everything out there is already already been written about I'm interested in Tech I kind of like productivity but that's like what the hell am I contribute to what this water well it was fear of perfectionism you know what is my stocks what if people think is hopeful about my grammar is bad or even worse what is 1020 years down the line some employer he wants to try to hire me as a doctor sees the 5 but I started a Blog and it's like why did you stop login 2012-2013 like I had all these like stupid fears in my mind like 4-5 years of these fears stopped me from putting myself out there online they stop me from right from starting a blog from writing a single word but then the 2nd of January 2016 so basically five years ago I discovered this book show your work by Austin kleon and single-handedly changed my life and it's actually the book that I have most gifted out of any other book I've ever read I keep multiple copies of this book in the house because often I'm talking to people and I come over and ask me for advice buy anything sold it's always around oh my God I'm scared to put myself out there I'll just give them this book it's pretty sure it's pretty easy to get through and it was just completely groundbreaking for me and helping me get over these various fears that I had and actually taking the plunge into writing and one of the things I really like about this book is that it's really a guide to self promotion for people who absolutely hates the idea of self-promotion like I used to think self-promotion was like a dirty thing and oh my God that it's not notice of Russian it's about showing your work not if you imagine for example if you watching me as a YouTuber you're probably interested in the behind-the-scenes what it's like being a YouTuber and therefore if I were to write about that on my blog you know do it'll like diary type thing where I'm like video on this is what the script looks like in this with the finished product looks like in these are kind of the notes that I made and this at the thought processes in the diagram is what I meant to get to the point with the finished product that's actually quite interesting and you know in the past when the internet wasn't really a thing people really get a behind-the-scenes look at other people's work it would be like a writer would go into that cave and write the book and come up with a book or not it would go into that cave and doing a painting but everyone wants to see how the paintings maybe want to see how the sausage is provoked racist is not about having to come up with hey I need to write something interesting it's actually just about documenting the stuff that you doing already know I was medical student have the time and so I could have very easily documented what life was like in fact I was reading those books back in the day and so I could have documented the books that I was reading him so sharing my fault about them in writing book reviews and in fact people haven't asked me what's what's like one regrettable that you have a what's one piece of advice you give to yourself 10 years ago and my aunts results I really wish I'd started a Blog earlier and I wish I'd just been writing reviews of books that read I first read this 5 years ago but I don't know what my thoughts and feelings were when I read this because I just didn't know him in them and it would be so interesting now to look back on the 4-Hour Work Week age of 17 and how change me I don't have any of that. I really wish I had documented things on a personal blog as I was going through at my life you're the big Theory I had was that this thing of I know I need to be an expert on anything there for how can I possibly write about it chapter 1 of this book says you don't need to be a genius you don't need to be an expert to share your process and to document your work and to show how your learning stuff you can completely Embrace The Beginner's mindset I'm a beginner on YouTube I'm just documenting the stuff that I'm learning and I'm like hey guys you know he was some tips I found helpful for me if you find them helpful maybe you know you'll enjoy watching this video or something like that Embrace being a beginner someone who's a beginner is open so much better at teaching other people who are beginners then someone who's the next but he has to do with goals is because of knowledge it's like when you become so Pro it something you forget what it was like to be a beginner asset and so like right now I'm at learning how to draw violin concept art I'm taking art lessons and I'm documenting my process thanks to Austin King's book show your work on Instagram and Twitter and stuff I don't even going to do like a little journey book post on my website because right now I'm not that old. I'm a total beginner but if you're thinking of getting started in. You might be interested be like hey how is it total beginner approaching this and what is the progression look like from not being able to do anything towards being able to draw things in the kind of nice until it really is all about showing you work the other Big Y that one of my friends and family going to think if I start a blog and I've got my own demesne audio.com again which is stupid because ain't no one actually cares like we will think the other people are looking at us and shutting us but actually everyone is worried about their own life no one cares video up there about how and really if you think about it like let's say you got a friend right now or cousin or brother or something and they're thinking hey I wanted on the piano and I'm going to write about my journey front of the encounter would you ready Dustin for that you probably wouldn't freaking idiot for having the audacity to Post online you would think up that kind of cool it's cool that you're documenting your journey I want to follow alone until it's completely ridiculous how we all have this idea that hey all the people are going to judge me but if we imagine ourselves in other people's position we thank you logo for starting an Instagram documenting the our journey this is actually change my life now and I want to talk about is the audio of a Serendipity vehicle description the way you want imaginators imagine you living in a village the only people you interact with the other people in your village and occasionally a train comes by and someone visits the village and you kind of have a chat to them and stuff but like you're really limiting the amount of people you could possibly have connections with people you can be friends with your limiting the Serendipity that can happen to you because you just you're just surrounded by this tiny village of people now imagine if you were the sort of person who you know once a month you took a trip to neighboring towns and he started making people insane clothes people ever that you saw that connect people who are interested in the same stuff as you. Just massively exponentially increases the interesting things that can happen to you if it increases your surface area for Serendipity and already like the metaphor that uses about the idea of robots when you create insured idea is you put your ideas onto the internet which means that little robots can basically carry your ideas and they all around the world and then there are people who sitting from Malaysia to Mauritius to Algeria who are scrolling the internet and they want to learn about whatever it is that you have written about or created a video about and when you're sleeping when you're out playing tennis with you and when you're on a walk on the river you pay no charge and those robots are like little carrier pigeons that deliver your ideas to people all over the world and what's amazing is you can make something once and robots will work for you for the rest of your life and so as they deliver your ideas to people Serendipity happens you meet new people they reach out to you they want to give you money they want to help you they have a Consulting project your help with anything whatever it is but why I like the word Serendipity vehicle is what they can imagine with the ideas that they share are beyond what you can possibly think of what they would want and the things that end up entering your life or things that are out of the scope of your imagination and that you could have dreamed up before so really when it comes down to it when you put in your ideas into the world you're allowing yourself you're opening yourself up to get old really interesting connections you might make friends you might make business associates might even meet the person you marry because of the fact that you are putting yourself out there on the internet and you're moving from this tiny tiny village to suddenly opening up your network to the entire world and that is amazing secondly because it's already helped me get clarity over my own thoughts and I realize this back in 2016 when my company wasn't doing particularly well we've been doing very well for a few years and then I'll growth start to stagnate thoughts and feelings around this and like feeling sad and feeling that mean of the company wasn't doing very well and had a real crisis of thinking like what the hell am I doing with my life and my am I getting this really good thing that's why I wrote a blogpost about it about this kind of balance between time and money and what it came down to it was when I wrote a blogpost about it and wrote it publicly and published it on my blog that help me solidifying clarify my own thinking around the cool thing is that by putting myself out there I connected with Austin kleon who wrote the book I have two cable interview on YouTube channel a few months ago this is what he had to say about this idea of carfango thinking what is interesting about having a blog or some sort of daily project even if it's like I post one thing to Instagram everyday or something loyal like that having something that you have to do everyday you find out it's not that you have something to say it's that you find out what you have to say so that's so like writing every day some people say oh you must have so much to say cuz you're right every damn like actually it's the opposite I have more to say because I sit down and write everyday and I figure out what I'm thinking and what it actually is that have to say so writing is actually not just communicating with the world it's actually a way of communicating with yourself because the simple Act of sitting down in front of a keyboard for 45 minutes or pulling out your notebook for 1/2 hour whatever it is you are creating space in the day for you to kind of connect with up with what's here and to figure out what's going on and what is it that I really feel and what is it that I really think that's something the beginner has silver very quickly is that this idea like why I don't have anything to say what am I going to blog about it's like the the pressure and the routine and the the muscles of blogging everyday means that will get to something everyday change my life I want to talk about here is the butterfly effect Butterfly Effect has decided that if a butterfly flaps its wings in like a Brazil than they like Prince produced by. Further down the line control the chain reaction that produces a tornado and decided that like a seemingly small thing that you do can have a huge effect further down the line until the way that changed my life is that it made me putting myself out there on the internet it gave me the baby steps to write a few blog post in like 2016 and so when it came to 18 months later in 2017 when I thought hey should I start a YouTube channel I didn't have that fear I didn't have that fear of getting stuff because I'd already taken the baby steps and started my personal blog thanks to show you what I think if I hadn't started the blog I probably want to start to the YouTube channel because I would have been Paralyzed by the oh my God I can't put myself out there what if what if people find out my real name what if my friends let me see my YouTube channel what what are people going to think but because I had 18 months with the practice of selling of like writing online and realizing that no one actually cares and my friends and family did not give this life is false about whether I had to plug I realized I can sell to YouTube Vlog my medical school if I can make videos about how to get into med school and no one has all that does is that it helps people and that's good and I can bring my audience and that's why I'm sitting here talking to you today at three and a half years later because I took the plunge into writing online five years ago. resume date yesterday with someone who I met online who was watching my videos and so if she and I end up getting married then that would have also been down to bring myself online and saw blood thank you talking to online and what to write how do you start well basically you want to Google free website and you want to make an account on WordPress which is completely free. Stock which is completely free or you can use to ghost which is the problem that I use it cost a bit of money but if you're genuinely serious about starting a blog that changes your life it's some very much worth investing in but if you are unable to or if you just have like this allergic reaction to the full spending money on the internet you can always use some stock or what price would have completely free David Pelletier when you start writing do not even think about what the world is going to be interested in just do what interests you and get to the place where you're writing about Niche topics I mean if there's any lesson of the internet it is you are not the only person interested in whatever it is that you're interested in like we know that and the niche topics honestly are the ones that are going to give you the best benefits of meeting cool people and having interesting things happened so yes. With the smallest thing that you possibly can start with writing about whatever interest you to document your work read show your work document your process document you learning stuff if you do that plus being slightly active then you'll just connect with other people who are interested in the same things and you'll make friends and you'll make business connections and you'll really enjoy becoming a global citizen of the internet so that's all you really need to get started the authors that are interviewed on the YouTube channel over the last year you should definitely check out the extended version of this video which is available on nebula by me and a bunch of other creators and it's a place where we can put our content without worrying about the logarithm and so4 video like that's where the extended edition is like 35 40 minutes long it means I can put that on nebula and not worry about having to cut things down bit by bit for YouTube on the friends I've got a worthless white oak tree my website for my favorite productivity apps Early Access to all the videos completely add freon so in the extended version this app to pay disappears and instead you just got a load of writing tips from me and the people that I've interviewed the best way is to senipah curiositystream sponsoring this video stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform and thousands of really high budget high-quality documentaries covering everything you can possibly think of an actually one documentary series of enjoying recently is called how to look at a painting which I'm watching because the whole Art Gallery thing and you know why do people enjoy looking at paintings but I didn't want to become a concept artist this is helping me and they get more of an overview of exactly why this happens and all the different things to look for in outlook for the really cool thing is that Curiosity stream has a bundle with nebula and so an account for curiositystream which is like $15 a year you actually get free access to nebula for a whole year bundled with that I took less than $15 you get access to tons of high-quality documentaries and also loaded my original content on nebula and also loads of other create original content nebula which make this the single best deal in streaming World fuel straight and you won't see the extended version of this video head over the details emailed to you check out this video over here which is three stories from my life about how I fight and continue to fight this idea of imposter syndrome people found that you suppose he might want to take them over there thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " play Prince welcome back to the book club Series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books and today was talking about your money or your life by Becky Robbins which is one of the most important book that completely changed my relationship with money is 9 steps to transforming your relationship with achieving Financial Independence which sounds a bit like self-help even actually it's it's a very well put together book that when I read it read changed my mindset when it came to work and money and how it kind of fits into my life let's start with the passage from the book with me earning a living was the means to an end the means was earning on the end was living but of a time our relationship with money spending it investing in protecting it worrying about it has taken over the major part of our Lives most of us spend more than hours of the weeks total of 168 hours earning money we must take time to dress for a jobs commute to our jobs think about our jobs at work and when we're at home decompress from a job we must spend money to maintain our jobs job cost you in commuting cost food vortex delete other workplace with all that time and money spent on and around our jobs is it any wonder that we've come to take our identities from them what else what do you do we don't say I do plumbing we say I am a plumber. Really making from what do we come home from Mom making a living activity with more life do we bound through the door refreshed and energized ready for a great evening with family and friends where's all the life that we supposedly made at work and she says that for many of us we're not making a living that we are making a dying we are essentially Whiting away our life energy on this thing that we call our job in the hope that is going to bring us meaning and fulfillment and joy and happiness and money and we say the things we value our friends are family community and Sudley in in every study has been done on a happiness and those are the things that lead to a happy meaningful and fulfilled life and yet most of the hours that we spend of a life energy is devoted to our jobs this is making a dying rather than making a living 21 at the next major theme of the book is about the question what is enough in an environment of more is better enough is like the Horizon always receiving the Fulfillment curve between the experience of fulfillment and the amount of money that we spent at the beginning of our Lives more possessions means more fulfillment as we get our basic needs met and as we move from the bare necessities to the niceties the positive relationship between new things on foot becomes more deeply embedded Within These two luxuries and throughout these stages we increasingly come to associate more money with increased levels of fulfillment because that's the way the Cubs going but then one day we hit a fulfillment ceiling when more money and more possessions don't actually lofting fulfillment & Beyond that peak of enough we didn't start it accumulate more more Potter the more stuff we buy and then the Fulfillment curve start to go down what's the movie spends the movie human rights for the less satisfaction were able to recruit from these possessions and so with this in mind what I think about time is like where is my concept of enough like in all the different aspects of life and in fact is research from Nobel prize-winning Economist Daniel Kahneman about this relationship between money and happiness any funds that at a certain point more money does not lead to more happiness points of enough in some of the studies is around $75,000 a year until ultimately as Robin says fulfillment is a compass and a Rudder for Transforming Our relationship with money she talked a lot about how instead of thinking of money at this nebulous concept we can sing money and all Life Energy like the concept of money is quite hard to find but what's always going to be true is that money is what we exchange a life energy for our life energy is essentially our allotment of time here on Earth the precious hours of Life available to us every expense we have everything that we buy is actually equivalent to hours of Life Energy that we've given up to on the money to buy the sink and once we stop thinking of money at this proxy for Life Energy we can start to calculate the real cost of stuff in terms of Life Energy hang up that new iPad Air that cost $800 and we're working a job that pays $10 an hour that would be 80 hours of Life Energy Works changing for this iPad or two weeks of full-time work and then we can offer Phelps is that really worth it nothing really is worth a life energy that we exchanged for it is investing in ourselves investing in learning investing in a skills and a fantastic way of doing that over a brilliant signs and computer science the closest Rural engaging and interactive and fun in a way that really should have teaches you the the bed bugs of the concept and then lets you apply to real life scenario so it's much more interesting in the way that we learn school stuff is about knowledge I'm not looked at things like Bayesian Network school's an inference and information Theory but all in the package that engaging unsuccessful if you want to join me obviously an amount of money that we spend is an exchange of a lot energy but investing in ourselves that life energy is generally worth it certainly is the case to justify purchases stuff that would buy firstly did I receive fulfillment and satisfaction and value in proportion to the Life Energy spent at this question is good because it forces us to think about how much Life Energy we're actually spending to acquire the things that we think that we want secondly is this expenditure of Life Energy alignment with my values and life purpose and this encourages us to think about like is the thing that would buying actually in line with what we say we want from life and what we've already believe and said late how much does expenditure change if I didn't have to work for money and this question is interesting because it think about like weather would buying this thing because it relates to a job for gunpla for buying a fancy suit to wear to work to impress our colleagues or fancy watch that you know if we didn't have to go to work would we still have that expense highlights an aspect of life that we don't often think about which is that in order to maintain our jobs and maintain our standard of living supposedly for appears we end up spending a lot more money than we really have to until those are just three discussion points from the book there's so much more about the some really interesting stuff in here about jobs and in the history of work and how we think about money and leasure and fulfillment and meaning electronic stuff but if you want to learn about how I've personally applied the principles in here to Achieve Financial Independence but how I developed very streams of passive income to get to this point of financial Independence thank you very much for watching a video and I'll see you in the next one"

            "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QtYOmblLOY",
            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you knew here my name is Ali I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is a new mini-series where we going to be talking about medical ethics and how to answer medical ethical scenarios that you might get in your medicine interviews we're going to be going a little bit beyond what you need to know medicine interviews but to be honest every single person applying to medicine I'm getting a medicine interview is just going to be reading off the full principles of medical ethics so if you want to stand out in order to use ideally we want to be giving a little bit more than just the four principles said that's what this series is aim. this video is all about the four principles of medical ethics which is the structure that me and my friends and everyone would recommend for how to answer a medical ethical scenario two things I need I want to be told again you can just get that and move on to the next section where we apply them to a real life scenario to be featuring two of my very good friend and they're both amazing interviews the both amazing at talking to patients and I have this medical ethics himself as a specialist subject cuz they did it as one of the papers in that third year and it reaches in front of the camera and discuss some of these ethical issues with you and I'm very grateful to them let's get this show on the road first thing I'm going to let Charlotte Amalie introduce themselves and then we're going to introduce a medical ethical interview question any kind of scenario which is actually exactly what I got in my Imperial interview so hopefully they don't use anymore because the game away but to be honest to the fetty standing scenario and it's exactly the sort of thing that a lot of medical schools use in their interviews so we'll be introducing the scenario and then will be explaining how you might go about answering it and as I said every single thing is down below * * look at some of the video don't feel like you have to watch a golden one go over like all of the same time or whatever anyway she'll mod going to introduce themselves coming up DJ for party at Cambridge redeads history and philosophy of science that we did papers in ethics and low interest of us in space sounds about ethics and low cervix good provision for us to have a discussion and to think through some of these topics with you ethical scenarios that other medical schools might give you interview a lady comes to you and she has a BMI of 45 which is foot 7 the morbidly obese category and you have to decide whether you get it and ethical implications in the ethical issues in this case what would you what would you do what would you say to your interviews and this video I'd recommend you posing the video and think about how you might answer it because now we push out and discussing how they would approach it first either going to introduce the four principles of medical ethics and then they're going to apply the four principles to this scenario and that's a structure that we would also best you use when answering these sorts of ethical questions principles that co-founded on inmates in the full principles so that is beneficence which is generally adults should be trying to help patients and there's no Maleficent so things to make sure that don't choose on making not doing any home to someone and this justice so making sure that we allocate treatments fairly and then Altoona me that patients are people in the room right and they should be allowed to make the I'm starting to get worried about any ethical scenario find the medicine I'm getting an interview with principles off by heart and will be reading them off so it's pretty much band minimum knowledge for medicine interviews but you know this video system Productions so now Charlotte is going to be talking about how she might apply these footprints to the question and that's really what distinguishes candidates because everyone it's another full principles and everyone is going to know that have to apply them to the question so really it's all about what you can say what applying them and going to showing the interviewers a little personality you know talking and engaging kind of fashion make sure you smile occasionally about something and secondly the kind of stuff you say even though every won't be saying roughly the same thing if you can say it in a nice way or you can give it give it give some examples of you show insight into medicine then that's what's going to set you apart from the crowd but yeah about how she might apply these principles to the ethical scenario at Hunt. I'm trying to dress it with the with the case at hand say in this case if we if we think first day about but if since Sue doing get a lady he's got such a high BMI is it significant Stripes diabetes and offering had the surgery is going to improve her health and improve long-term outcomes so so in terms of doing no harm it's kind of the same we we don't want this lady to to develop nasty complications of of being overweight suit again things like stroke diabetes hypertension I said we wanted minimized the risk that she's going to be exposed to if we then think about autonomy if we presume that this lady is is is she's over 18 immense capacity to decide then she's got a right to you to decide for herself what treatment she wants and if if she wants to have that intervention we just don't just need to need respect. I'm to take that into account when when making a clinical decision and the Justice thing is is it about how we allocate our resources to bariatric surgery is is expensive it takes it takes experience surgeons and nurses unfair to stuff this the time the person will have to be admitted in hospital anoles the nursing care that goes with that and then could we do with that money that we going to use for this procedure we could we could do or the surgeries interventions we could offer the people drugs and so it's about how we decide what's the best use of all resources because the NHS has is its finite resources it's not able to give everyone everything and say in this we take each one in ten and discuss at 3 so I think Justice is probably the one that stands out most to me and say we'd have to consider if it's going to take x amount of my to give this this lady had bariatric surgery how else could we use that and how many other people might not benefit so if we said it was going to cost 20000 pounds for example if we have that positive money I'm we could we could stop smoking secession service that would impact 200 people should we should we allocate the resources differently because of the people heat benefit is founded on the principle of that we should discriminate only on the basis of clinical need and that can be really tricky in situations like this because we have a patient sign French who has a healthcare need I'm she needs to lose weight in order to to not have reading negative outcomes but we also have a huge number of the people who needs interventions and it's it's about how we we can discuss that with an interview and show that we appreciate the complexities of allocating Healthcare resources and opportunity cost Seacoast is always something you can mention when talking about the Justice component of full principles cuz of Eternity causes of those things it's like what else could we be doing with this money instead of just what you're being off so if you choose between two different patients for transplant or something like that still consider opportunity cost think about what if we didn't give the different spot any of them what could we use that money for instead of kneissl argument with the extra box braids when mentioning it in our ethical papers I think if you would mention in your interviews as part of justice that would School you some good brownie video interview is now looking to hear from a late he's going to be spending this point just a little bit this lady so if we give her the surgery could we be avoiding one of these future complications the one thing that stands out to me is that actually ignore Maleficent it's Tuesday the fact that we could cause home by giving him the surgery and say I'm at this juncture one of the main things you have to realize that every treatment you gave has side effects or has complications or has risks and not something you're really going to have to Grapple with as a doctor in the future and you to decide whether. Beneficence outweighs the new Maleficent and so I think that's an important things to do in this scenario because make sure that when discussing things to the patient when deciding what's in the passenger you take into account the home you could cause by doing any treatment and not just the home that will happen if you don't give them the treatment mentioned because it if you if you could appreciate that actually surgery is complicated than have complications on Century causes harm that's another kind of brownie points for inside medicine. They looking for in your interviews pick which is Chloe's quality adjusted life years and that's another thing you can bring into the Justice thing because that's the measured by which most things are allocated in the UK at least about Collies qualitative urine sold about how people are feeling and it can be difficult to quantify in in in numbers and figures and the attempted we make in in the NHS to try and navigate a Minefield is to use these things for quality adjusted life years so Collies and what we do we for every intervention for every drug we have for every treatment we're going to offer we we think how many years of life they are going to add onto a person so how much longer we'd expect that person to live if they are given the intervention and then we wait that based on how good the quality of that time will so it's on the scale of notes one so long would be a year in perfect house and we wait for you and we think about things like are they free from are they free from psychological distress how well can they go about performing their activities of daily life things like getting up getting washed getting dressed so every intervention that we have will be given the rating and not in some part goes goes to help us decide what where should we put our resources and the National Institute clinical Excellence has some recommendations floors and nice suggested if it if one quality adjusted life ear cost less than about 30,000 lb it's probably cost-effective and we can probably offer that on the NHS anything more than and Things become a little bit more tricky so interventions like giving someone a cholesterol tablet a really cheap Hercule it's really excellent value-for-money where is treatments very specific immunotherapy for very rare types of cancer that really expensive per quale and say we have to we have to balance all resources and ankylosaurus a way of helping to think about Justice and resource allocator that's a big discussion about colors you can look it up and go Link in the description to the Wikipedia article a few hundred more about thinking practically what you might do if you were a doctor actually faced with an ethical scenario because if you if you can mention this in your interview that again rules of school you lots of brownie points because so few candidates are going to be thinking practically about the scenario they're going to be thinking in an abstract way to go get pain for principals but if you can say that actually if I were in the circumstance what I would do is then again that's not small brownie points that's more kind of big ticks in a sheet for the Gander Mountain within your interview is probably about that not just thinking about these through with ethical issues but also thinking practically about how you would have to go back as adults her because it's all very well saying I think about beneficence nonmaleficence what you have to say in reality what I'm going to have to do is sit down with this patient and speak with her about the pros and cons what the risks are the benefits of the surgery could be and it's going to be home unless you really think you could be causing serious harm and you really don't want to recommend surgery if it is that risk benefit decision then ultimate that will end up lying in the patient's hands with guidance making sure that you inform her of both the risk and benefits and let her then decide what she thinks his is worthwhile for her beneficence nonmaleficence Justice and talked about how they might apply these to the ethical scenario and you also heard a little bit about koalas a little bit of opportunity cost going to do interviews we could end the video hair but I don't like the idea of just kind of saying to you guys that justified a full principle that you'll be fine cuz I think it's important to know where the four principles come from and when I was applying to medicine and my friends about this we already know where they came from we just kind of medical ethics you have four principles done but as we were going through a clinical ethics and low cause we realize that actually principles about for a very good reason why they come from is kind of useful just a little bit more understanding and more of an overview of where they still into this whole medical ethics debate what is the right thing to do on the uncertain circumstances location and you ate if you do have to decide between two transplants if you do have to decide whether to give this surgery to this patient about patient if you have to decide whether to operate without consent if you have to decide how do we work out what to do in a given situation we could do what the philosophers back in the day used to do and follow particular schools of thought so some of the main ones might be down till the G virtue ethics utilitarianism consequentialism thing and these were all like Frameworks that were invented by various different philosophers and they gave us a nice framework for making moral decisions how to wire up one decision from another and work out which one is the morally right thing to do. Back in the day these Frameworks what does used to use to work out whether you were to walk out what to do in in an ethical dilemma so if they were deciding between two patients to do a treatment on they might close on utilitarianism or they might use virtue ethics to decide whether self rate without consent something like that the problem was that first made these various Frameworks they're all well and good but either quite conflicting in that in a heater that makes different decisions and kind of medicine you want a more standardized Frameworks medical professionals can use the same framework idea about how to make decisions in life generate specifically to medicine so what happened was that these two beachum and Childress they put together the street he's about medical ethics and they came up with these four principles autonomy beneficence nonmaleficence and Justice of all of the schools of thought so taking the bits that all Cummins HD schools of thoughts and applying them specifically to to a medical stare at least four principles have been criticized but still a pretty good method for that they come from a distillation these other schools of thought somebody was modified of utilitarianism and consequentialism or stuff like whatever but just think of them as a distillation of all of these various. Principals so what's going to happen now is that three main schools of Thoughts by virtue ethics Dermatology and utilitarianism knowing about these schools of thought helps you got to get off the fence light if you're torn between once and Ariana doesn't tickle question then it's going good just kind of reading of the four principles and explain the arguments but what if they press you for an answer say you're so which patient would you get the Rope to it and it's not enough to just going to be on the fence so that's what happened in mind. Interview bails me for to make a decision yes or no and I pulled up on utilitarianism I said well I think a utilitarian approach with would work for this and that would favor... and with this what we do in in Fort Lauderdale medical medical ethics and law exam papers as well be back from Oxford coming to decision based on one of these Frameworks I think if you do know about the schools of thought in a just expands your ability to give a better answer in ethical scenarios so let's hear from Charles and Molly will be explaining these three schools. And I will say some final words at the end does various different schools of thought about how what is morally right and what's morally wrong when is the school of vet to Essex so this was pioneered by our stuff to learn this day and keto fat fat that you should think about not what you do but what you are and that if you are doing what you think a virtuous person would do then you're doing the right thing Escambia Court accept Section the argument in the end because you might think that eventually this person is someone who endorses slavery or someone who enjoys his harming other people for what they perceive to be the wave doing things so it can let itself down depending on what you think a virtuous person is there another way of saying it is deontological in themselves either morally right or morally wrong so you can always going to be wrong and another person if I always will no matter how many people you might say if no matter what the consequences off of the action University so if you can say that everyone in the world if they acted in that way it would be better then that's fine but if you could apply that option to the Homeworld say francisquito breaking promises if you couldn't say that breaking promises would be universally the right thing to do then you shouldn't do it since the last big can school of thought to cover is consequentialism which does what it says on the tenant thinks about consequences of actions and utilitarianism is is the is the most important type of consequentialism that we we need to address these guys in the 18th and 19th century Benson Citrix to mail and they they they said it was fundamental level happiness is good suffering is bad and so the right thing to do is the action that will cause the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people watching the overarching decision should be a cost-benefit analysis so you think about think about the pros on the car reaction and if the if the pros outweigh the cons then that's okay so that's the doctor School of consequentialism utilitarianism maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people come from very different moral values that you might Society based on Sazon Tapatio suits on but actually in Practical terms it's really helpful as for the medical point of you to think more about was it be when they distilled down into the we talked about earlier and how we can apply them to Medical practice and those are the ones that were distilled down into the four principles of medical ethics which is how we recommend you should medical ethical scenarios so what we discussed we talked about the four principles we giving you introduction to what they mean we've applied them to this specific medical scenario about do we give gastric bypass surgery to this fat person a little bit about opportunity cost practically speaking what doctor might do if faced with an ethical scenario I think those are things I might actually give you brownie points when you're when you're doing your interviews finally ended it with a discussion about these three schools of thought just to kind of expand our minds a little bit so thank you very much for watching this was just an introduction but we've got loads more videos coming out over the next few weeks about other parts of medical ethics and subscribe and Olivia Michelle Emily who be saying goodbye I'll see you at the general framework that we would we would advise you you kind of use in your ethical scenario questions think about the full principles and justice the number to Stearns and structure on surround that but there are some of the most specific topics that you might get asked about things like termination of pregnancy euthanasia can sense confidentiality issues specific issues to them and Waggoner 230 in other videos will go through and in some more detail molding you need to know but we think that if you have a good idea of these things that it's not any ready useful for your interviews but also getting into clinical practice you need to understand what's happened in the past what doctors of Prevacid and how that same phone how we practice today"

            "text": " we don't often think about the physical environment that we live in working but it's probably something we should pay more attention to its environment is the Invisible Hand That shapes human behavior and older or internal motivation and discipline is important ultimately it's the environment that surrounds us that most determines whether we'll find it easy or hard to build and maintain the habits that'll help us live happier healthier more productive lives design because whether we're at home or at school or at work the physical environment rhombus has such a ridiculously big impact on so many different things but intuitively we think that if we want to be more productive or we want to build a healthy habit like eating healthily or play a musical instrument or in my case intuitively we sort of think that we need more motivation or discipline but actually there's an easier way to do all of those things and it's all about the power of friction I'll go best pet theory that isn't perfect but if you want to be friction is the most powerful force in the universe and unsurprisingly environment design is one of the best ways to leverage its power so it we can think of friction as the force of resistance in the gap between intention and action intention is I should practice the guitar and the action is actually practicing the guitar put in between that we've got this this friction and friction is book closes border the problems so overall if we want to encourage good habits we should reduce friction and if we want to discourage bad habits we should increase so that's kind of the basic premise of environment design it's really about increasing or decreasing friction in intentional ways and for me the biggest way that I've done that in my life is sleep so back in the day I used to make the terrible mistake of taking my phone into bed with me I was staring at the screen browsing Instagram watching random Youtube videos or once-in-a-blue-moon maybe even replying to a message on Tinder putting my phone across the room for me so that I physically couldn't reach it and then suddenly like magic I started sleeping better because I wasn't a waiting time on my phone before bed and I don't have the blue light screen Tearing Up My Heart next to me is my Kindle Paperwhite on the bedside table and I have the brightness turn down to like 1% to organize my iPhone around this principle of friction on the very first queen the only apps that I've got all the useful ones the ones that I would actually want to kick on if I open my phone I have to go to the second screen Instagram Twitter Youtube Tinder Bumble hinge unlock my phone the first thing I see on screen is not the screen out of the notification screen that has useful apps like in Castro the infinity pools that I know I'm just going to get distracted in the realm of music so I've been dabbling with the guitar for the last few years but I want to make a concerted effort to get better at it but before supposed to be like this is not a very big living room is this an apartment but it would be like on the other side of the room and that was just even it just being on the other side of the room was just too much friction and so often and rereading Atomic habits for my book club video description and stuff I'll just take my guitar and now I have it stationed on the sofa like like literally leaning on sofa so that if I am in an unproductive slump and I go sit on the sofa instead of taking out my phone and it's just as easy for me to pick up start doing a little bit of practice to just that slight reduction of friction by moving the default position of the guitar is mad that I practice guitar for like half an hour a day for the last few weeks and listen to start doing that and it was just that one small change that made the difference my phone it's something to help me get out of that slump and that is brilliant if you haven't heard bring into the Fantastic platform for math science and computer science courses and they've got tons and tons of these across the different subjects which was very Interactive watching a video going to like this one it's like you're actually interacting with the stuff you're getting problems along the way and the closest that I'm going to going through these days of the computer sign Series so they're building and even though I was very young I've never quite understood the fundamentals of computer science for me if I am in a bit of a slump I'll make myself a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and I will sit on the sofa and just do 15 or 20 minutes one of the online courses gets me out of this dump a pretty cool if you'd like to continue lifelong learning and sign up for these online courses check out the old. we can then use it to our advantage to build good habits and break bad ones and that is what this book by James Clear Atomic habits is all about you should read it if you call me then check out the video which is my book club summary and discussion of the highlights from this book"

            "text": " happy New Year if you do hear my name is Ali on the final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is the third video in all series about medical ethics and today we're going to be talking about euthanasia and medical ethics at the end of life about these topics into videos in this video we're going to be sing on what is arguably the most well-known case in the UK we're going to be introducing sometimes like after euthanasia offensive position assisted suicide and explaining what the stones are and more importantly how to use them appropriately cuz I think there is a lot of confusion surrounding this time and a lot of medicine applicants to be using them inside of the wrong contact explaining the law in the UK as it stands at the moment so the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide I'm going to be talking about the doctrine of double effect if you haven't heard then import to in the next video we should be out at some point next week we're going to be talking about assisted suicide on cases where people have tried to change the laws surrounding assisted suicide and the ethics associated with that videos and they going to be introducing to us the case of Lillian voice is called Lillian for many years and She's suffering Barbie with arthritis and she's she's a palliative patient she's someone who's never going to get better I know what trying to do is really fast symptoms the one day on wood round let me insist you as a consultant I am in so much pain I'm suffering so much. I just don't want to live anymore I want you to do something that will end my life today what do you do as a doctor in that situation you know this patient ready while you can see the already suffering that I symptoms aren't being managed and that desperate that they life would end to release Memphis a free what would you do in that scenario with all Spider-Man into do this thing to end her life in reserve relief as a friend and I'm in discussions around euthanasia and end-of-life care this case as we go through explaining end-of-life care and ethics around euthanasia and assisted dying and we'll tell you what happened what you might do in that scenario a little bit more information that might help you this is the most severe case of rheumatoid arthritis you've ever seen in your life and you really admire previously she was always taking things being good humor about the whole thing but now it's gotten to the point where she ready contact suffering anymore and is an unbearable Agony On Top of the rheumatoid arthritis she's going internal bleeding she goes out to see me I should go back to Elijah's which is closing her internal organs to become gangrenous and it's further speaking to a suffering and her two sons Patrick and Jonah by her bedside and they and all three of them are begging you to expediently and her life to relieve her suffering what would you do so if you were lost this or something similar in an interview the four principles of protein of the structure that we always recommend transferring medical ethics in areas that we mentioned in the first video so in this scenario we've kind of the four principal data which is one of the principle of nonmaleficence not doing harm and the principle of beneficence doing good there in conflict because someone's life is already doing good and you could argue the ending someone's life is not doing harm because you're relieving a suffering but you could also argue that Tina ending someone's life is precisely the definition of doing home in terms of autonomy we should surely be helping her in the life but in terms of just as we talked about an affair allocation of resources and just kind of feminist in general is it fair for us to take the life of another human being book intention is so this is a really tricky case under the case was going to have befallen the undercurrent of this video and we can be kind of referring back to it as we explain things in a bit more detailed in your interview if you're awfully like this yeah you could go with the four principles approach but everyone is going to be doing that you know little bit more if you can give a little bit more about arguments surrounding euthanasia and assisted suicide and then you definitely going to be standing out so to the end let's introduce sometimes now and showtimes euthanasia literally means a good death and they're awesome sometimes that people use we just want to clarify so you'll hear people talking about an active euthanasia is when you actually do something with the intent of ending someone's life so that would be for example injecting a drug that does nothing kill someone and you'll hear people talking about passive euthanasia but we don't think that's a potentially helpful term to use because like withdrawing a withholding treatment that results in someone dying but calling it euthanasia is not helpful at all because euthanasia is illegal but withdrawing of withholding treatment in a patient's best interest is medical practice and say what we'd advise you to say is active euthanasia is definitely illegal but withdrawing or withholding treatment in accordance with the patients best interest is good clinical practice when is what happens up and down the country in every hospital everyday a patient with a treatment which is going to end their life but the Tilted is not actually physically given the treatment the patient actually takes it themselves physician-assisted suicide active euthanasia passive euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide all of those things are illegal in the UK because the intent is to end someone's life and intending to end someone's life the cheats matter with holding treatment is good medical practice and is not illegal if it's done in accordance with the best best interest of the patient and I just want to beat rate please don't use the phrase passive euthanasia passive euthanasia is so confusing because I said possibly think of it as you know unplugging and plugging a lots of machine but something is only ever defined as euthanasia if your intent is to and if your intent is to end someone's life then that is murder and that is illegal in the UK withdrawing treatment is not the same thing as passive euthanasia so please don't get the stupid * 2 fused and in fact what we will suggest it's just never ever use the term euthanasia just hugely confusing withdrawing treatment is good Medical Practice in some circumstances it's not illegal it is a good thing to do the thing about withdrawing treatment is that the reason why it's so confusing is that often withdrawing treatment will result in someone's life end but your intent when you're withdrawing the treatments must be that you think clinically that the treatment itself is no longer in the best interest of the patient so there's no point detention here you not saying that continuing to live is no longer best interest you're saying that the treatment in particular that you are currently giving them is known as no longer in their best interest so if they're plugged up to load of machine then you can make the argument that in the suffering caused by being plugged up to load of these machines is no longer in your best interest yes if you unplug those machines the patient will probably die but your intent is to relieve the suffering because the treatment is not in the best interest your intent is not to end my life and yeah a little people say that this distinction is just arguing over semantics like what differences between me saying that I'm going to unplug you lots of a machine to end my life but says I'm going to unplug you lots of what machines because I think the luck because I think Alexa what machine is no longer in their best interest and kind of we can buy the full date the point is at the moment in the UK MLB 10 the life you intend must be that you are withdrawing treatment because you think the treatment is no longer the best interest so we've defined sometimes I we said that please never ever use the phrase passive euthanasia when talking about this whole topic now let's go back to. Cox and his family again GameFAQs and actually ended up happening was he injected the drug shortly afterwards she was safely at the time but that is what happened I'm thinking about his defense legally defended himself sounds like what he says was active euthanasia with we've just says is completely illegal in the UK he gave her a drug and she subsequently do eyes double effect and what it means is that it's based on your intentions essentially so a lot of patients nearing the end of their life I'm quite serious drugs and there's drugs if we give them in high enough quantities actually shoots in the patient's loss actually we need to give sufficient amounts of drugs to make sure patient accounts for this time is Paramount that way there's not patients dying distress and in an undignified Manner and so it should be allowed legally it is allowed to do these drugs the point of the doctrine of double effect is that even if adult take gives a drug drug in order to improve. and to make them more comfortable and their intent is not to shorten the life and that is considered legal in the UK in relation to Morphine a very strong painkiller actually all the research has suggested that if we use morphine properly it doesn't show in people's lives and so in reality this place is already used as a defense to Nigel Cox again it would it would absolutely a defense for him even if he tried so actually did was used to Joco potassium chloride and potassium fluoride is good for one thing and one thing only and not stopping someone's heart there is of a symptomatic relief to be gained from injecting potassium chloride and so by using that substance don't your Cox was never going to be able to use the doctrine of double effect has any sort of Defense stop the doctrine of double effect and that's an important concept to understand in this whole debate about euthanasia and assisted suicide look like though is that it's it is mostly a theoretical argument these days palliative care has a the point where we very rarely prescribing drugs that have the side effect of shortening someone's life there is very little evidence that morphine in particular children people's lives that's the most famous one that people think of there is a small amount of evidence maybe that benzodiazepines drugs that reduce people's education towards the end of life there is some evidence that maybe those might reduce their life and maybe in those cases you multiply the doctrine of double effect but in general the vast majority of palliative care patients we don't need to shorten the life cheapest offering so the dolphin double fact is we said mostly of theoretical Concept in these cases so let's not talk about what happened to dr. Cox I'm so very said that he couldn't use the doctrine of double effect as a legal argument in this case it was eventually found that he was he was guilty it was eventually found that he was guilty of manslaughter but not because as we said earlier on it wasn't clear whether Lillian would have died without his injection cuz she was so ill anyway so he was found guilty of manslaughter he was given a suspended sentence so he didn't go to prison for this and he wasn't actually struck off from the GMC so he's still main processing now he has definitely since this happened in the 1990s I'm so what we can learn from this is that this is a particularly difficult ethical case and sometimes in the know active euthanasia are strictly illegal in certain instances we can start to appeal to what other doctors would have done and other doctors might actually sympathize with how horrific this decision most productive and therefore his sentence has been slightly more lenient to what we're saying is that none of these situations except caught and they can afford differently in the cold specific situation that you find yourself in and let's be clear about this. We're not saying what he did was right angle he did was totally expecting illegal but we're conceding that this was a terribly difficult position to be put in an application that in assassinations we would never want to be put in that position it was a very difficult decision you have to make and he did what he thought was right at the time and you know you can form your own opinion what do you think it was a good thing he did or about thing he did the fact of the matter was it was illegal maybe should the oil be changed who will give him the facts of the case and they were lost what they would have done in that circumstance one of them go to distressed and was able to ask a question on the second one said that he wished he would have had the courage to do while dr.cox it in that second sounds you can form your own conclusions from from all the facts that we thought we told you so far and the Wikipedia article you can read more about this current legal status of euthanasia in the UK it is illegal on hundred percent definitively there's like they're pretty much no two ways about it we've talked about the doctrine of double effect we've defined sometimes we said that passive euthanasia is not the same thing as withdrawing treatment withdrawing treatment is Medical Practice in Asia is always illegal and thread video we've been referencing the case of dr. Cox and the really really difficult dilemma associated with that and we get off to something about if you can reference the four principles of medical ethics as you should request watch ringer on but now you can do a little bit more about what you know about the legal status of euthanasia and little bit more about maybe referencing the doctor Cox case if you feel like it if it kind of goes in with the flow of your interview and that would really help you stand out I think one and then why scenario that I've had some you some universities off what mean because it shouldn't take much to have this level of knowledge you'll stay to the application but what am I sorry that I heard was there was a patient you were doctor any kind of explain to a patient who asked you that he wanted to end his life so this is kind of what we do in that second thoughts and a way to answer that is I think what they want you to say his first day you would you would want to come explore the patient's concerns like Austin why the feeling that way already trying to get to the bottom of it all ultimately they pressed say that you'll be bound by the law that you're anything was like his illegal in the UK and you can kind of explain that has really good these days a lot of patients are afraid of maybe dying in pain and suffering dying unable to breathe and generally palliative care is really really good we can generally deal with most so that's how it is but to be honest if you get something like that that's mean that's more like to finally a medical student what they would get in their final off gave rather than what he should really get as a medicine applicants information now if you do get hit with the end of this video thank you very much for watching we set that euthanasia is strictly illegal in the UK but people have tried over the last few years to change the law in the UK I personally think the law should be changed in the UK in favor of may be allowed a little bit more leeway for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and not going to be the subject of the next video we're going to be introducing these cases of people who were going to be talking about why the try to change the law but then we talking about the ethics of assisted suicide so yeah thumbs up I haven't subscribed to the Channel please consider doing so I'll see you next time bye"

            "text": " aprons welcome back to the channel this is going to be a little bit of a chit-chat rumbly, video where I talk about my feelings with a cup of chamomile tea in my hand and yeah I want to tell you the story of how the book I'm writing feels like it's been a total failure so far and I feel like I've already wasted the last six months of my life 10% in summer of 2020 when I was approached by an editor from a Publishing House in the UK who said that if you want to write a book I want to write a book about productivity and so can I go talking and so was like cool let's write a book about productivity and then over the last few months and I've kind of been together to craft a book proposal a book proposal at this document where you said of lay out exactly what your book is going to be about and what's the conception what's the theme and why you supposed to do like an overview of every chapter book proposal is hard because you have to act as if you got the whole book figured out I don't really have much of it figured out it was loose idea at this point but when you're writing a proposal you so don't have to pretend like you've you've got everything together and coming back and forth for the last few months working on this proposal when I crossed into something good and at the store January 20-21 at this point we wigi we could the concept review of the book was going to be about which is kind of a good start I thought you know what a standard like nonfiction book is about 65000 to 80000 words I can write 2000 words a day how hot can it be done so I know it's this on Twitter and I'll do my email newsletter I think I mentioned on Instagram as well and for the first seven days of the new year I was even posting updates hey look at me look at how many words I could write in a day plus 7 days into it I realized that something else when it comes to writing advice advice most people would say is that don't worry about quality just focus on quantity in the beginning like you have rough first draft is supposed to be really crap it's supposed to be really messy and as I was typing everything the page I was really thinking every single paragraph on my God this is so terrible this is really bad why would anyone bother reading this but every also that I would speak to him and say hey don't worry this is all part of the process every other things that their work is absolutely crap on the first drop and really good writing about writing is about rewriting multiple multiple multiple times and ready all the magic happens in the edit and I had that in my mind and so is thinking about how hot will it be 2001 today by mid-February you know 6 weeks from the 1st to the 14th able to have like 84,000 worth if I write 2000 what's a book we're like on day 8 of The Challenge stuff was going on I didn't make time for writing 0 Woods that day and then the next day because I was like oh well you know I kind of failed him I would come yesterday you know what let's just not bother today and then I I kind of did that thing which I think a lot of with a permit to do electrical failing with a bow it's like it what I've wasted 1 hour watching the TV show Netflix I might as well just finish the whole season or like a gymshark athlete in one slice of pizza so that was basically what I did with this book writing thing where I really stole my progress because I felt like I didn't hit that 2,000 would blood count and so I decided I needed an intervention that's why I set up these like Zoom co-working study with me ride with me obsessions running for the last few weeks and it's is really cool cuz each day we have like a hundred and something people sometimes two or three hundred people attending the zoom section from all around the world completely free and we just would have do work together so I usually play my Spotify study with playlist with instrumental songs like bangers from The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter in the background and I share my sound with everyone else and we use the Pomodoro Technique to get blood work done and Sunday sessions have been a very good way for me to meet like forcing myself to write because I'm rocking up everyday at 10 good morning. Just having having a hundred people there when they webcams just kind of doing the Renwick it was like a nice social somewhat social way for me doing my writing during letdown when I wasn't seeing anyone apart from my housemate and so over the last few weeks I've been banging away at this book and about 2-3 weeks ago a fun to go to a point where I was like kind of happy with it I was like okay cool this Brody makes sense we kind of know what the books going to be about it's quite broad it's sort of a very kind of general-purpose e time book around property play around meaningful productivity around the other meaning like what makes a life meaningful in the nuts with the stuff and tying in principles of productivity into that and it ended up being like us a 30000 Word document I was at 80 pages long was like tons and tons and tons of writing and it went back and forth with my head a few times and he like out of the bits to it and made it sound really good at all those amazed like you I would I would I would write stuff which I I would think of that would be terrible and I'd send it to him and then he would convert it into like what sounded really rated G and yeah we have we had this episode of 30,000 what document where has like the length of a standard non-fiction book that is 65 to 80000 words to write the actual book it would it would have just been flashing out each chapter summary into about two or three what it was which at the time I thought this wouldn't be too hot but then I decided that okay let's send this proposal to some people that I know in America cuz it would probably were trying to land a book deal in the US and send the proposal to this is America who I know through friends and true kind of Internet police to see what they think of it basically ever everyone that I showed it to in America said that this is not very good they will set it in different ways and it still needs a lot of work and that was like a real blow to make sounds like that we put in to make what we go was good and we're sending it to American Dad says because the US market is for trying to sell it to back here is an excerpt from one of my new friends call David moldauer who specializes in helping golfers with book proposals and he had loads of experience in the editing and Publishing field this is what he has to say about the book proposal a dice look at your videos and I immediately I feel like this is great from your videos I was like I needed to get it and I'm excited and then I was like okay this is a little bit you know this isn't going to stand apart content-wise I don't think you figured out what the book is you could be describing pretty much any business or self-help book ever written from a certain perspective yep like it better if it does deliver kind of book the people just left, Cabot's just instantly constantly recommend you're going to be haunted by it for good or for ill for the rest of your life and whatever that thing is like how Loop okay but like he's a guy now like he's a guy forever probably like anytime so what we want to do is he want to make sure that Allie is the whatever guy that he wants to be and doesn't end up shoehorned into something that is it really what you want to be talking about for years years write the book for two years and then talk about the book for 2 years 2 years to f****** about it what is a kind of a process I have a process but you kinda want to get it what the thing is and then everything filled out from that as opposed to I'm just going to throw the spaghetti at the wall and the reader will find a thing that useful to the reader somewhere in there yes that's basically what they did was saying and I'm very glad that he he gave this kind of constructive criticism is that you need to throw out the proposal and going to start again and rework the concept from the ground-up this was like like what I was getting kind of Lonesome out the feedback from the different people all of whom would more less thing that same thing that you know just inside different ways it was quite like a low point for me and I say I want to say no would like invited, because I told you my life is still like very privileged and very good at very much a first world problem that hey I've been approached by publisher to write a book and I wanted to be ready very very good and at the moment it's only kind of good until people told me some pretty good and so nice. we're together everyone telling me this book is after the terrible and I need to start again so that was one thing and then alongside that they were a few other kind of weird sedatives and Contracting this little stuff and it was old like piling up and I already felt like I had this huge like weight on my shoulders almost from I don't like the wet stress but I guess it did feel like stress get out all of the stuff that first world problems and this isn't real stressed like I know people do on the real stress especially people working on the front lines in the pandemic that's not me we have to throw out the six months of work and then start again from scratch it was kind of weird cuz like Littlest of piling up I had this real sense of kind of negativity and resentment in a way towards this book it was a feeling of why the hell is I take the song how am I even qualified to write a book about about anything let alone / productivity and I guess this is the danger with those sort of working on something on your own without much like outside payback where you hide yourself into thinking that it's good and you're like oh yeah this is some good stuff thinking about like you all the s*** some you like yeah check me out I'm writing a book and then you send it to people that like I was that you're pretty crap it wasn't great for my self-esteem at the time and the ice would have felt this distresses of all these different things going on around the book soda piling up and that was nice of that I had a session with my writing coach his name is Isabel he's very nice like self-promotion when it comes to writing and all of these other various kind of baggages Association would like writing a book which apparently lives in different with his go through and there was something that was said during this cold which really like changed the way that I was approaching this I just got to remind me he was luckily you're supposed to be having fun writing this book it doesn't sound like you're having very much fun right now and I was like damn your rights like just just a reminder cuz like my whole Mantra throughout life is that you know nothing of before destination the thing that yes goes like like white whatever but what what's more important than setting and achieving ambitious goals what's more potent than that is enjoying the journey and enjoying the process of doing them weirdly if you enjoy things that you're doing then chances are you'll become more successful at them if success is what you're up to my Temple and so if you ask me things like how you say productive and all that kind of stuff how do you do so much with your time it never feels like work because it's for the most part like really fun and School's Out school's right med school is right like working at the doctor's right thing that YouTube thing and all the businesses on the side I've always found them ready ready ready fun and depress the writing this book started off being refund and then I let myself get into this kind of hole where I should have felt like all these things will finding something fun is a lot more about how we approach it then it is about whether thing itself is actually fun I know some people who have a lot of fun doing laundry and doing dishes and there are like occasionally moment in my life where I'm doing the dishes and laundry and I'm genuinely cell and it's usually because the story that I'm telling myself about the thing is like slightly different and the end of the school study that they done where there was this a researcher who who interviewed lots of Hospital cleaners like Hospital janitors at 11 Hospital the job site and some of them kind of treated it as just a job and they're just like yeah assistant robot to clean the floors but there were others who were treating it as like an actual Cooling and they were recognizing that by cleaning the floors and cleaning the hospital they were making life these guys felt like they had much more meaning at work and they perform better in the job and they had more fun and they were just kind generally have here until I think this idea of having fun while we're doing things as such an important one and I sort of lost sight of that while these various bits around the book will putting up of sincerity versus seriousness and I really like this because the analogy here is that like if we think of life is kind of like a game life is a game everything in the world if we got another day and this booty two ways of playing the game or like to do it with a blank playing the game we can play it seriously or we can play at sincerely seriously sort of went when he play with someone who takes a game too seriously it's like it's not really fun playing with how to take the game too seriously but it is a lot of fun playing with people who play a game sincerely the difference between the two is that if you're sincere about something you're doing your best and you're trying to play the game you're trying to win but you recognize it at the game and your blessing the competition or the the rival the seriousness you're not letting nothing get in the way of your own enjoyment and the enjoyment of other people why is he taking very seriously that's just like oh my god it feels Less Fun the most serious you take it and it's really used to be my feel with exams as well like exams in school exams in medical school all of them is kind of like a game a game that I was going to try to try my best to play and win whatever the whatever that meant to me but it was a game that I was never going to take so seriously to the point where it would kind of affect my my emotional well-being the thing that I'm supposed to be having fun in writing the book I also realized that I'd been taking it too seriously like I've been fixated on the outcome of oh my God spoke to be really good and be and it feels shame shameful to admit but I was really fixated on me that I really want this book to be a New York Times bestseller I feel so so ridiculous admit that out loud because that's such a an arbitrary kind of goal to have those are really really really really really hard to get book of the New York Times bestseller list like so much of it depends on factors outside of run control and normally I notified of setting goals the things that are outside of my control celebrities YouTube channel I've never really been a fan of setting a subscriber goal reviews go or Revenue go instead my goal assist I want to reduce to because making two videos awakened something in my control whereas subscribers views revenues all that stuff is outside of my control. For some reason I kind of changed my usual mode of operation for this book fixation on the outcome was another thing that was causing me to lie in bed at night when I couldn't sleep and I'll be thinking about you know how do we how do we Market this book and it was going to be about how we make sure it's good and I was putting so much pressure on this idea of this book being a mess I think I was losing sight of the fact that this whole thing is supposed to be fun and so I'm now kind of going back to the drawing board with the concept of the book it might end up being very similar to what the book proposal, set so far this work that we've been doing over the last few months but I suspect it's going to change quite a lot so I've been reading a book by Steven pressfield called the artist Journey and he talks about how through the course of any kind of autistic and ever like writing a book you get this moments pulled the All Is Lost moments like that was very much what it felt like when I go to sleep. people saying that this looks like felt like this was the oldest from there and you're in in hindsight you really glad that things didn't work out and start it hardly ever I'll just go through this and that just kind of feel like what I'm doing for now and so we're going back to the drawing board so the revisiting the concept of the book and figuring out like what is the thing actually about what's it going to be about I feel like quite optimistic about it now because we're still very on the process and I'm really glad I didn't write more of the book or I'm really glad we didn't send it out to Publishers to try and try and get book deal in America and it ended up with the current state of it and then read this book is going to stay with you for the rest of your life so what's the book that you want to write and I kind of realized that sites would have been so tunnel vision focused on trying to get with the words onto the page for the original proposal the original concept that it's sort of went away being a book that I wanted to write into being more of a book that I felt like I was compelled to write it didn't really feel like me and so moving forward I'm quite excited to basically anyway throw out the work we've done so far for the last 6 months maybe some of it will be useful maybe not but either way I think all that was necessary to get to this point or it's like okay now we can start again and now that I've got a better idea what I'm doing hopefully it'll be easier from here and really just a constant reminder that this whole process is supposed to be fun just what I think of that this is supposed to be fun like the reason I'm writing the book is ultimately to have fun like I'm not writing the book to make money I'm not writing the book to do to become famous to have fun because it feels like every fun it feels like an adventure it feels like a challenge it would be an interesting journey to go on and I know that I would definitely regret not doing it rather than regret doing it I hope Hunter whenever I I kind of get to a point where I'm like a kind of sucks I remind myself you know what this is supposed to be fun to take a step back by trying to touch myself from the outcome I try not to be too fixated on the Golem the New York Times bestseller list I remind myself to be sincere rather than serious about to follow along with my book journey with all the ups and lows along the way and there is a link in the description to my book email newsletter thing is called elitebook Johnny basically every few weeks I'll send you a copy and as I write stuff I might send you chapters to have a look at and get some feedback on or I might ask for your stories are your opinions about various Concepts and working on so if you're into that it Lincoln video description 21 one of them is writing a book but there are five others which I've been working on with varying degrees of success. Thank you so much for watching have a great evening I'll see you in the next video"

            "text": " my friends welcome back to the blog as usual I'll be taking you through how I spend my day and we can all pretend like anyone actually cast I wake up at 7:57 a.m. just before my alarm goes off at 8 for 3 minutes I feel like an absolute Legend being one of those people that wake up naturally without from the monkey the spouse of self-congratulatory Pride I proceeded to spend 45 minutes lying awake in bed without my phone literally just staring into space and hating myself a wasting away when I could be getting up and being productive at one point I even wonder whether this could count as meditation going to be one of those morning routine Instagram people but there's nothing intentional about it it's just procrastination of the purest form anyway I finally talked myself out of bed at 8:45 jump in the shower thing a few Disney songs brush my teeth get changed and rip a pair of socks at 9:20 simply make myself a cup of coffee using the Aeropress and one that Machiavelli would approve he actually come to the one of my Instagram post the other day which was obviously the best thing that's happened to me since I move to the UK in 2003 I spend the next 20 minutes on boxing you tell them to that I'm experimenting with descriptive video labeling machine to help me be more organized from 945 I spent half-an-hour talking up some brief notes on my 11 inch iPad Pro I had three different Hangouts with friends yesterday because I'm really cool Hangouts to remind myself of them later on I spend the next 45 minutes wasting time on my phone drinking coffee cutting my nails and doing a poop at 11 a.m. I finally start doing something productive I bust out my brand new plus-size looked him 1917 notebook and I stopped planning out with talk that I'm giving later that evening Cambridge University colleges the title for the talk is time management side project and enjoying life as a medic that's pretty Broad and I spent around 25 minutes trying to figure out the story that I want to try and weave around it I spend the next ten minutes reading about the diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancies Workshop that I'll be teaching in the afternoon from 11:35 I spent an hour-and-a-half gearing up to film a video with this new teleprompter thing are there but come see it and this is just like pretty awesome in that time and it's really hard to read from a teleprompter without looking and sounding like I'm reading from a teleprompter and so I decide to screw it and film the video another time I realized that I've been awake for 5 hours by this point and other than they got light up my evening spoke about practically nothing to show for it I'll give a dog charcoal when I realize how many people see me as some sort of productivity the internet really is a wonderful thing at 1 p.m. my cycle over to the Cambridge University School of clinical medicine tours the workshop at the Cambridge University of tetrix & Gynecology Society annual conference Cambridge University Obstetrics & Gynecology Society inspiring talks enthralling lectures incredible workshops few hours after grabbing some of the Free Conference food I need 3 rounds of the sexual health workshop for groups of around 20 medical students h 15 students I think they'll be rotating among the different workshops we go on a station that has gone ecology station that has the sexual health station and then there's a station with some of the students told me about that electives in Alton gunny and we go days out of models of vaginas to how to do swaps protector how things roll player who's going to pretend to be someone who's excessive vaginal discharge that's causing some some problems and Sir the job for the students in the workshop is going to be to take a history figure out what's what's going on get her background medical history and her Obstetrics & Gynecology history and then do an examination on these kind of dummies and then do a set of swabs today going to be during a high vaginal swab and endocervical swab and a committee Solomon told me about cervical smears are so this meal program is a screening program that helps catch early early signs of cervical cancer and so you know women in the UK will be off to do smear test Pacific to see if there are any cells that are undergoing discount ghosts or change them I plan to be super productive and film 3 videos in the next hour but instead I end up procrastinating on the sofa doing absolutely nothing it gets to 5:37 and I still haven't done anything useful so I decided I'm going to get out of the rut I'm making myself a coffee and exercising my mind with an online brilliant today I walked through the course in Advanced Computer Science which is all about search engines I've become interested in the idea of searching a bag of data while trying out different note-taking systems and so this course wasn't incredibly interesting introduction to the different methods for searching brilliant has loads of other what is a math science and computer science interactive and make you think as you go along after going through the first few chapters of the search engine course I Have a Kiki stop at today's daily challenge thinking about it for a few minutes I fail it's holding it and I kicked myself off to seeing next and because it was actually very doable if I thought about it and a small to way anyway if any of this sounds of you'll Street you should definitely sign up for brilliant by going to brilliant.org/Ellie and the first 200 people to use that link will get 20% off the annual premium subscription to thank you brilliant response video anyway after 20 minutes of doing a search engine stop on brilliant and drive over to Gaston College from my talk I've been invited by the gut and Medics and vet Society to speak about time management side project and enjoying life as a medic I'm there for around two hours and I took My Philosophy about financial Independence passive income and how to do fun stuff in your spare time a few students day off to its to have a chat and get some cheeky photos which makes me feel like a real celebrity I drive back home by 8:45 p.m. and I spend the next two hours smashing my head again wall trying to figure out how to use this bloody teleprompter while I tell myself that I'm finally going to fill needs three videos that I plan for the day but also over an hour filming a look at the footage and realize that is just so obvious that I'm reading from something and doesn't look natural at Old so I end up scrap learning how to do anything is always difficult at the stops and I'm sure that if I persevere I'll one day be able to use a teleprompter like a pro and that'll make it easier to film evidence-based videos where I'm talking about scientific studies and all that stuff at 11 p.m. I packed my bag drive an hour to the family home in Saint Albans or I have dinner and hang out with my mom and brother and my aunt and uncle who are visiting from Pakistan we had to bed at 2 a.m. and so and this day in the life blog if you watch this far I hope it was a complete waste of your time please remember to sign up to add protein to open with Lysol eat to help support the channel thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video goodnight"

The brain end up finding negative patterns is it that we can actually train ourselves into and out of these different ones that so if you find yourself finding next to passions in life it is possible by repetition enforceable power and just practicing quite a lot actually convert your brain to have a more positive a positive person taking when we train our brains to adopt a positive Tetris effect we're opening a mind to be ideas and opportunities that will help us be more productive effective and successful three things that we're grateful for everyday this forces us to engage with the part of a brain that consciously looks for the positives in our daily lives but you're going to have a ripple effect and actually there is some evidence was quite interesting that just writing down a list of things that you're grateful for each day has more effect on your personal happiness than doubling your salary at work which I think is pretty much booked like this another mindset shift that we can develop that helps us ultimately be happier healthier and more productive and that's how we respond to failure and shown pulls this folding up potentially there are three different ways that we can respond two negative events three pumps that we can take puff one is where the negative event produces no change and we end up exactly where we started off too is that the event leads us to was further negative consequences and we end up worse than when we started and par-3 is when we using adversity in face it means becoming stronger and more capable than before the event answer the audio way to respond to failures and setbacks is to find respond to them by turning them into learning opportunity and this is something that's been throughout the field of psychology what the weather and wet and probably the most important one is the value of social support unsurprising Nations research has shown that the most successful people invest in the social support networks and as a result a happier more productive engaged energetic and resilient and so while we might be thinking I know I'm going to put my head down and put in the grind and lock my door so that my University friends coming cuz I need to work for my exams the best way to actually achieve success because we know that having a strong social network is so important in fact American workers found the people with few social connections or two to three times more likely to suffer with depression and other Studies have found that having a note very good social support network is just as bad for your life expectancy at things like smoking obesity high blood pressure and milk by saying that our social support can prove the difference between succumbing to The Cult of the average and achieving awfullest potential happiness is a subjective and emotional state but the evidence presented in the book demonstrate how important it is not only forum my physical well-being but also to a performance in a physical and professional lives and in the lives of those around us we need to start seeing happiness as a key ingredient that we can all develop rather than merely an outcome or an author of success reserved for those High Achievers as in the book happiness is not the belief that we need to change if the realization that we can thank you for watching also only a week of experiencing this so the only week after only a week of experiencing this 20-year mind off the only wake of experiencing this 20 year off the only week of Welcome to do I'm going to do a separate video about all the different I'm going to do a separate video about the different evidence ways I'm going to do another video on like all of the different I'm going to do another video on the way I'm going to do another video on the ways that research has I'm going to do another video on the ways that research has shown that we can actually make ourselves more happy but some of the things he talks about in the book happiness is a subjective evidence presented this is a subjective"

            "text": " hey guys welcome back to the channel if you need to hit my name is Ali I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is the start of a new series of study with me videos which is very exciting videos I'm going to be documenting my process and long-term joining preparing for one of my postgraduate medical exam I'm a doctor now but for the last six years I've been at Cambridge University Medical School you know taking exams multiple times a year on before then 8 hours before then GCSE full than you know trying to smash those years 7 end of year exams in shots and stuff before 15 year. I think I've personally gotten pretty good at doing exams in a fun and efficient manner because I think I've got purses that makes it fun because you know I like to do things in my time like making videos like this one videos I'm going to be preparing for the mrcog the membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and gynecologists is the specialty that I want to go into and with every medical and Surgical Specialty you have to take loads of exams along the way exam don't just end when you finish medical school you also have to know a lot of the basics that you would have covered in like the first and second-year medical school so enough of that in this video I'm going to be giving you a brief overview kind of a broad brush stroke over the of how I intend to prepare for this exam I'm currently using to prepare for this exam so hopefully at whatever stage of Education you're right whether it's cool colored University old Beyond hopefully you'll find something interesting to gain from these videos where I document my process of studying and share the tips and tricks okay so let's talk with the two most important fundamental principles of effective studying and I have made long videos about these they are of course activity pool number one and spaced repetition number 2 and if you haven't seen my videos detailing the evidence behind ear what's those people have commented saying those videos alone have changed their life and they have transponder exam results and if you haven't seen them to watch them videos please do you test yourself on a subject the better you will retain the knowledge on the understanding of that subject testing yourself is not just for the exam it's also a process that you need to do throughout the whole the whole black stunning person center stage in my entire study strategy for this exam is spaced repetition the more you space your repetition of stuff out overtime the more likely it is to stick in your long-term memory I don't believe in crime and criminals complete meth like a year plus to prepare for the physics exam for the exam I also wanted to become like a good doctor and no if I have to. Sort of thing and spaced repetition is also going to play a massive part in my study technique strategy whatever you want to call that I can recall specifications those are going to be the two fundamental pillows that everything else is going to restaurant the strategy is going to be split up into three phases and these faces are designed because there is a such a huge amount of content to cover and you can pretty much go into unlimited detail on every topic every disease we have a ton text book written about it but I'm not going to memorize textbooks for every single of the hundred diseases that you getting old and dying cuz that's a complete waste of time three phases of the plan phase number one is going to be the subject this is the most important thing in any kind of strategy for preparing for any kind of exam the subject what count what the broads chapters are in within those chapters what the subtopics are and then typical where I'm pretty much going to be trying to work out what I know about these topics already so I study dogs and Ani in medical school like everyone does so I will have some baseline level of knowledge about a load of these topics So the plan in phase one is going to be to get paper or other on my iPad Pro with I'll talk about a little bit later on we can watch a video of that the content plan is for the whole subject and then write down pretty much everything I know about it already everything understand so that idea of where the holes in my knowledge are and where the biggest holes in my knowledge are so I can fill those holes first phase two of the plan is going to be to fill those holes but using a very big paint brush like broad brush stroke overview I'm not going to care about this passage nice little details which is very tempting to go down the lineup because you know once you start learning about polycystic ovarian syndrome you can just find a text book about reproductive endocrine physiology in the holes painting them in with a massive huge paintbrush touch that by the end of phase 2 all pretty much know all the content from a very very basic point of view and then be able to Dig Down Deeper and I'm hoping that you know as I do practice papers stuff like that I'll start to get towards the point where I could feasibly pasta exam quite comfortably that's kind of the aim of a face-to-face three that's going to be when I can kind of drill down into the detail in the stuff that's interesting stuff I care about whatever I feel learning more about more about because this is going to be the case for love your subject special University medicine I'm pretty confident I could pass the exam if I took it now I'm going to be trying to school this final few months then logs. Hopefully get me into a few know the high Mark Brockett range whatever you want to call it and kind of looking at papers with Me A Reason evidence looking a new research that sort of stuff 3 that's going to come many many many months further down the line because I just all I care about is finding in the holes with a big ass paint brush with Broad brushstrokes number 3 drill deep into the details only after I've done all of the above to build my study Empire over the next year or so to start with my flashcard app of is going to be Quizlet who are the presenting sponsor for this video thank you very much to Quizlet for agreeing to work with me this is pretty cool being sponsored by Quizlet ecology mostly ended up using Anki the school just cuz it's what I knew and it was fairly easy but then on quite a few of my study with me videos I got coming from students saying what am I try Quizlet because it's going to design and they build this whole gamification thing into it kind of from day one which makes revising more pleasant and fun interesting experience I kind of found with Anki it was becoming a real chore to get through my flashcard x to the point where I kind of stopped using I can switch to my boobs sheet method I would love to give us about and we shall be doing videos onto dress in a little bit more yeah I listen to Quizlet it seems pretty cool I've been using it for the last few weeks so far I really like it I like to eat the views I like the design and like the gamification I don't even know because I'm reading some of their post on their engineering blog where the data scientist have person you know statistics policies of how they build the space repetition algorithm and how they ensure active Rico works and I'm a real sucker for laptop so I think that's part of push the envelope as far as effective studying thing goes with phase rotation in October what are the two fundamentals of effective studying I'm using the same a technique more that bit later about kind of being able to explain it to Father old is much more important for understanding but especially the case for postgraduate medical exam there are absolute tonne of fact that you just have to learn and apply Quizlet is Ray going to help me do that I'm going to be using the trusted Google Sheets for two main purposes firstly it's going to be a tracking tool for Myspace before Myspace repetition I'm not really going to make a revision timetable be a retrospective revision timetable meaning that I'm not going to say that you know next week I'm sitting this topic the week off including the topic instead I'm going to look what I happen to have studied once I do it and once I asked to recall that and again does more information in my study with me I'll be doing a more detailed video talking about how I built this retrospective revision timetable using Google Sheets so that's the point of A1 Scuba sheets I'm going to be using Google Sheets a little bit for active recall as well but I do like putting out of Broward general concepts within my Google shape so that if I'm looking at kind of mechanism of Labor as like a topic In Obstetrics for example I can immediately see what the broad topics are and then I glanced I can look at my car to see how will I know this or if I'm considering testing myself cuz it's going to be a theme all the way through at least a hundred times already considering testing myself then I can at a glance see that this chapter we go to the topic of the mechanism of Labor and then I don't know very well what do I know about the topic and then I can keep my active free recall what I just think or explain to my friend or my house may or write it down whatever whatever I know about that topic so do what she supposed to be number one as a retrospective revision timetable and secondly as a method for active recall Again movie that's coming on those a little bit later of course I'm going to be using my trusty iPad Pro with apple pencil as my primary note-taking method of note-taking device I'll be honest I'm not really a fan of as a form of revision that normally found of summarizing however it is useful to have like you know a single source of Truth for load of things that existing summaries are not readily available so I made a video companion along with Quizlet in Google Sheets Austin's post paper cases that sort of stuff with a few different online question box for the mrcog the diffuser should one that The Unofficial ones I'll be subscribing to all of those and doing as many questions as I can I'll be getting my hands on books from libraries and from the internet and stuff that have medical cases you know why they give you a description of a patient and I'll spoil you do next and kind of talking through the cake so that's going to be a big part of my strategy and I'm going to be doing that pretty much from day one because there's no real point in preparing for an exam if you don't know what's going to come up in the exam you might as well just do the exam papers at you go longer to see track your progress as a pretty sure I'm not getting very good moth but I'm hoping that goes on as I acquire knowledge and understanding you think some textbooks yes I know I've talked a bit and previous videos about how I already don't like textbooks for medical school exams and the reason I don't like them for medical school exams is that I think the far too detailed and you don't really need that detail to do really well in Medical School exam the more about Sino just getting a very broad understanding of everything rather than a deep specific understanding of something where is now or the postgraduate level where a lot of the information is unfortunately tied up in textbooks or tied up within like research papers that are hot so I'm going to be having to use textbooks especially in Phase 3 of a time where I'm going to be digging deeper into each of these topics you know just using Wikipedia is no longer going to cut it even though it uses medical schools some part in my study technique over the coming year play fighting Franklin ticket for this exam is quite a tricky Endeavor and supposed to be quite a heart exam pulse rate is quite low so I'm hoping that you know I will be among the people deposit want to do very well in the exam but be also because is about being a conductor knowing my specialty and I want to be the kind of doctor that knows this specialty well I don't want to deal with my daughter so it's going to be fun I'm working full-time at the doctor and part-time of the YouTuber alongside get the bow the best bang for my buck in terms of a cardinal in understanding and return for the the smallest amount of time invested as possible so it's going to be fun and I'm hoping to bring you along for the journey if you'd like to follow along it would be really cool so thank you very much I hope you find the video useful I have to pick up some interesting things that you can along the way you know the usual study with me style afro back to the the good old University days. Thank you very much"

            "text": " different welcome back to channel in the studio I'm going to go over 21 bits of advice that I would give to my 18 year old self let's get into it I think about the game that you're playing and think about what are the victory conditions of that game when you are in school then the game was how much the game of prime get pretty good exam results trying to get into University but when you go to university that is probably not the game that you're going to continue to play and you might fall into the Trap of continuing to try and play the exam results game because it's a what you've done but it's one of those things that if you are going to play that game and you know there's nothing wrong with saying that game but if you going to play it you want to do it intentionally rather than accidentally I'm just question of what game am I playing it's actually quite a good one to keep walking yourself every few months. do you still playing the game that you thought you were playing and that crucially that you still want to be playing the game that you could find yourself playing because to be honest that decision that you took when he was 16 to go to medical school you didn't need to hold yourself to that decision for the rest of your life and you have to Adam should ignore the Suncoast I just think what's a game I'm playing right now and it is the game that I really want to be playing secondly you should try and develop some skills that you know are going to compound over the long-term that's something that you want appreciate when you're 18 because you're going to be just thinking about the short time you can't be thinking like everyone does and their own like interest in the here now but you really want to start doing things at 18 or even younger than that you want to start doing things 18 that are going to compound of the time Thursday please please please pay attention to your posture one of those things that when you're 18 you spending hours and I was sitting on the computer hunched over like that's because you're cool you see any problems when you're 18 you won't have any pain you won't have any issues like that but further down the line maybe when you're 26 you might be thinking damn my pulse and I wish I'd correct this eight years ago you really want to be taking a look some more photos than you think you should because you won't notice have the time anymore I think it's a bit of an inconvenience taking photos of stuff but he is never going to come again in the future you're always going to be so glad of the memories that you recorded by taking photos at events and taking photos even if your friends as you're having chills in your room before you really want to be more of a documentarian of the stuff that you're consuming stop that you're creating I eat please please please when you read a book when you allowed to call it when you listen to a podcast o Bonnie Raitt I don't know before I work wake or something like that when you read these books please write some notes about what your thoughts and feelings were as you were reading them again it's one of those things you probably won't appreciate at the time because you'll think I've read this book I just want to go on to the next one but if you just take even 10 or 15 minutes to consolidate your thoughts and to think about okay what did I actually learn from this and how have my my feelings how's my reactions how's my day changed as a result of being extinct or listening to the f****** then that is actually going to help you in the present moment but it's also going to be really interesting to look back on in the future on even better if you put those things on a public web site then that is going to get to Main value and then you're in brand stop Grove much more quicker than actually did because you were just taking the time to document the things that you would learning along the way and doing their best to try and help others try and be a connector or a hub that helps connect to different people and different friendship groups you're going to have a lot of anxiety and insecurity going into University about making friends you're going to be worried that you're not going to make friends you can be worried that I was going to like you firstly take heart because literally everyone suffers from those anxieties when they go to university as well realize that friendship group need someone to bring them together and I'd be okay with being that person be okay with being the person to set up a WhatsApp group for a group of friends be okay with taking the first step towards inviting people to a room to hang out be okay with organizing events will that kind of stuff because everyone when they're in that position they want someone to take charge and you can absolutely be that person if you want .06 you're going to do a pretty good job of putting yourself out there University you're going to join all these clubs and leave mailing list and only societies and you going to go to all these events volatile very good there's always more that you could be doing and if it's a choice between sitting in your room one night watching The Vampire Diaries or you know making the extra effort to get dressed and go to the events that maybe you've been putting off please go to the event BNSF on the things where the individual event that you go to probably won't matter but the more you expose yourself to other people in an old way the more you'll surface area for Serendipity will just increase and you're going to find yourself mean toilet making friends in the unlikeliest of circumstances but the way that you can essentially optimize that luck in your favor is by putting yourself out there more than you currently are seven get a doorstop those things are fantastic they wed your door open and keep your door light up an old time let me know when you're asleep but basically every other time and actively encourage people to come to your room and actively encourage people to interrupt you while you're trying to study because you're never going to remember those like extra few bits of productivity that you have. someone feels comfortable enough to come over to your room at 11 at night just to have a bit of a chat those other conversations that compound into friendships further down the line and those are the things are going to be more grateful for rather than the fact that maybe you go an extra 0.1% on that essay that you working on point of 8 I mean to people you will only ever regret it put them in line buy some Bitcoin and absolutely do not under any circumstances try and sell it 24-10 nothing good ever happens after 2 a.m. you're going to really enjoy hang out with people and before 5 in the morning recognize that up until 2 a.m. Hangout Too useful often 2 a.m. those like they pulled up at 5th and nothing good ever happens if you want to kick people out of your room and go to bed because then you aren't completely waste the next day with this would have effectively a hangover from staying up until 6 in the morning and then getting 2 hours that is proper grammar nothing good ever happens after 2 a.m. a little bit of a little bit of studying every day when you learn team you're going to discover the magical power of something called active recall and spaced repetition a memory works is that it's like if we do a little bit of something every day of a long. Of time that's far more likely to end up in a long-term memory whereas if you do a burst of work I'm trying to cram for a test before an exam like that stuff is absolutely not going to stick in a long time and when you get to be actually being a doctor and someone like a surge you working with us to your question about and ask me you're going to get yourself and you going to wish that damn I really wish I'd done a little bit of work everyday and I would have kept up my knowledge of anatomy or kept up my nose after the other day because you know that you knew at one point but it's not going to come to you when it really counts for again a little bit of work every day goes a very very long way bus ticket was helping you in your exam but more importantly he was giving you that knowledge that you can that you can then have the foundation for the rest of your life Point number 12 seek forgiveness rather than permission at some point might get the idea to start a particular business or website or even a YouTube channel seek forgiveness rather than permission don't feel like you have to email the university to ask them for permission to do a thing or email your college to two. Is it okay if I do this just do it and if you have a problem with you can always seek forgiveness for the timeline phone number 13 please please please stop worrying about what other people think of you because they're really not thinking of you and I walk around you going to go to all these events and you're going to think people are looking at you and judging you and caring about what you're doing it already know everyone is gone ascites everyone has their own problems most of the people like 30% of the people that you're going to make it have a struggling with their own mental health problems that you never going to know about until like 10 years down the line so don't worry so much about other people jumping you cuz they're really not people are nice people are friendly worried about themselves so you you do you and don't worry about it so much 14 really struggling with something ask yourself how hard should this really be and how hard can it be on something that embarrassed likes to say what would it look like if it were easy first-year medical school at Cambridge you're going to think it's a big deal to think oh my God I'm a first-year medical student at Cambridge University that's a big deal that should be really hard and you going to convince yourself that is really hard and you're going to even sabotage yourself because you're going to be acting in a way this thing is harder than it actually is and then by the time you get to a second-year you're going to realize that actually this isn't so bad and a big part of the anxiety that I had to run to in my first year a big part of those were actually because I would just work myself up and my mindset was approached as if it's going to be hot 15 it's absolutely okay to skip lectures open time the lecturers just read out from the lecture notes anyway and you'll have to lecture notes and if you want you can just go to a cafe or coffee shop or restaurant and you can just go to the lecture and you're on time that's completely chill just make sure you don't like trying summarize it because taking notes as you going to find out when you read the book make it stick and when you discover the evidence-based studies hit you going to realize that taking notes is a waste of time for the most part so don't try and summer I do like to know it all so don't feel like you have to go to the Lexus it's absolutely okay to fall behind with your University work during time time you'll tons are going to be 8 weeks long that is not a lot of time and you going to keep up for the first like two or three weeks and then you're going to stop falling behind in behind behind I don't even feel really bad about this because you're going to think everyone else around me is keeping up whereas I am like really falling behind Presley don't worry like 90% of the Euro group is also falling behind they just pretending they're not but secondly your holidays are really long and there's nothing really to do in the holidays other than go to the local library with your friends from school and all study together and that's actually quite fun so it's okay to pull behind during sometime during term-time you have oldie Society do you have all these fun things that you could be doing so don't prioritize work over the social stuff you can prioritize work during the holidays 2017 when you read this book before I look like you're going to realize that you can develop sources of passive income please these days when you have that whole process run with it and try and do those things because further down the line like at the start when you're 18 and 19 you're going to be putting so much effort into making these like websites in this project and you're not going to see any returns for a very long time but eight years down the line you're going to be so glad that you spent a little bit of time in your Universe 2 years trying to do these extra projects to make yourself a bit and to be honest it's not even about the money it's more about the skills that you gain during that process charge money for it is one of the best learning experiences in life in general are you going to see this time again as you try more and more projects throughout University is it comes to making money from this from this. Don't obsess over it but also don't treat it as something evil because you know the art of trying to monetize something will itself teach you so many lessons destination University is going to be the best time of your life and it's only really going to happen once and it would be a shame if you look back on that time and you think them I was so focused on trying to climb that you know the greasy pole of achievement I was so focused on trying to get to it's about first class or get this lucky higher marks. I forgot to enjoy myself while I was there and you know it's totally okay to have goals it's totally okay to shoot for things like I want is on the journey has Brandon Sanderson would say and eat mistborn Series in The Stormlight Archive by the way you should read those sooner than you did life before death strength before weakness Journey full destination share your work and yourself with your friends without any expectation of give us a few months into University. Everything becomes so much easier when you work together with your friends and you treats the exam is your Collective enemy I'd rather than viewing as like a single player game that you're playing in competing with other people people your friends will compete with your group instead think of it as a collaborative Endeavor and when you're sharing stuff don't worry about it but I don't worry like I said this as a plan with John and then John didn't share something with me it's like it's like share openly remember you will remember the feeling that you're going to have with your medical student colleagues when you are all kind of working together and sharing resources amongst one another into your heart the Serenity Prayer which is God grant me the strength to accept that which I cannot control the courage to change what I can and the wisdom to know difference basically don't worry about the stuff that is out there. Outside of your control because it's going to cause you undue stress and anxiety and worry instead focus on the things you can control and focus on doing how to make them better and finally point of 21 please please please learn how to study efficiently for your exams baby has days and weeks and even months during using an effective study techniques you're going to think that rereading your notes useful you're going to think that summarizing units is helpful you anything what you don't realize is that on your team what you don't realize is that there's a huge amount of scientific evidence around what makes effective studying and you really want to try and then it's sooner rather than later if you want to stop the best thing you can do check out my closet on skillshare aquaberry Conde sponsoring this advice video fantastic cuz it's like five hours worth of content and it piled absolutely everything that I now know 8 years later about how to study effectively using evidence-based techniques and strategies you should be one of the first 1,000 people to hit the link in the video description because that will give you a free trial to skillshare and then during your free trial you can watch old five hours of his class and then you can suddenly immediately have the superpower of being able to effectively and productively study for your while you're there you might as well check out the other classes that I've gotten skillshare as well there were two of them things around productivity and how to live a more productive life which is something I know you're into someone about how to use flash cards specifically the app Aunty to really supercharger Medical School knowledge baby really glad that you discovered monkey further down the line but you're going to wish that he used it for anatomy and biochemistry and Physiology sooner rather than later annual premium subscription to Scotia is less than $10 a month you spend more than $10 a month on pointless Subway than point of coffee and point to take away you absolutely can and should spend that $10 a month to buy a skillshare premium subscription is literally so good I'm going phone number to which is learn skills that compound of a time there's like tons and tons of stuff that you can learn on skillshare that you're not going to learn at University so please spend some time during University is investing in yourself a subscription and hit the link in the description to get study for your exam effectively and efficiently oh and one more thing another piece of advice I forgot to give is that you really want to get started with investing you'll spend money in stocks and shares you're going to make a website and it's going to make a bit of money but you're going to do the stupid thing I just have that money sitting in your bank account to depreciating time instead what you need to do is start investing in stocks and shares as soon as you possibly can 18 is 92 young 14 is not too young 11 is not too young basically the other you can get started the more you leave time for that money to compound at a time if you want to learn how to actually get stuff investing complicated it feels like a black books to you right now but please click.

            "text": " I got to go to the black and yellow the study with me as usual I'm going to take you through my day of what I did when I Was preparing for my exam and hopefully going to share a few bits and Bobs tips and tricks along the way so this happened a few weeks ago and I was getting a bit bored of just kind of revising in my room how to change it up a bit but hang out with the clinical School library it's only about a five-minute skateboard ride from me and this is a good General tip that I find helpful like changing of the atmosphere makes original up more manageable specially when like being in the same place Washington YouTube videos maybe editing a video but from noodle with a decided that I needed to learn how to examine testicles active recall August 8th like asking myself what do I know about this topic Botanical medicine and most of the subject resulted online and people in the Air Above the Clouds using was made by a medic from like 2010 or the telekinetics you so there's really no point in us making notes about the examination so easily accessible summary of information but I don't think she write down is a mnemonic and anytime it's like Littlest I try and figure out a way of making a fun in the morning, and secondly I write things down in order to categorize things anemia and I just feel like a long list Dorothea textbook categorizing different kind of chapters or a difference of a subsection I would kind of write down anemia in the middle of a page and like do a spider diagram so I can categorize the causes of anemia that something so going back to the test Diamond Patriot recombination after reviewing the topic making a couple of notes to like formula Monica in my head that I knew I was going to review after lunch time Time Forest is an app that's kind of lets you plant trees on your phone and the trees take 25 minutes to grow and if you use your phone or go away from the app at any point during that time than the tree die so it's a good kind of regimented way to use the Pomodoro method which in 25 minutes five minutes of rest mode or method of the time but I do find it sometimes helpful if I'm in a library on my own and I want something to make my reservation a little bit more of a game that then I use something like Forest to make myself do the Pomodoro method 25 minutes 25 minutes and 50 it's totally worth it to spend. 2.52 to increase my happiness and increase my enjoyment just a little bit I think that's a good use of money personally like going over my notes or whatever I found some quiz on like a Dermatology website online and could have just went through the quiz and as I found area that I wasn't comfortable with I filled those holes and has another General point that it's important to like change how do I apply you active ECO spreadsheet to like methyl physics or engineering and the answer is you probably don't because math physics engineering like the best way to revise doing practice sheets and problems and iPod papers and all that kind of stuff and there's no need to shoehorn your revision for particular subject into a technique someone else is using just don't come in until your evasion techniques to whatever subject Pacifica that you were by default conditions that wasn't quite comfortable with his that instead of just looking it up like I might have been tempted to do in the past I decided to practice what I preach and before looking anything up I would actively try and retrieve that noted for my brain so for example of what is the management of acne I know that I have come across many times before but I just wasn't quite sure so before I ask myself that question I kind of pretended like I was in an exam and try to answer in my head and then going to find the answer that I came up with nothing that's a better strategy than just looking it up because that I can recall his way of life notary helpful if there is no pre-existing summary of the content available or if you're catching riding things in like nice color so that you can visually get an idea of what the syllabus is songs about making a quick document on notability iPad and writing brief notes about it maybe including a picture maybe including a spider diagram however every time I do I do have in the back of my mind I know I shouldn't be falling into this trap of thinking that making notes does previously back in the day when I kind of use have the month Adolfo I'm being so productive but I should be actively using these notes in order to learn stop rather than doing the nurses for the second thing that's this is very kind of present specific like if you think that you learn best by making notes and you're getting the results more importantly then by all means please continue to make notes don't let me rain on your parade it however you are spending hours take notes and you not really getting the results that you want then maybe consider that making those are probably not the most optimal strategy for like officially inviting for your exams pretty much just do whatever works for you and it's going to depend on how you feel about it and how you feel about the results back to the Dagan so from 2:37 for about 15 minutes I walked on the stoma examination that was stoma is like a bag that comes out of your: and like if flush against your skin for people who've had leg surgery on their: removed Diamond one of these like if you see one in real life like what you have to say about it what do you have to feel about it what you looking for so I walked in the stomach lamination for about 15 minutes I probably could have spent much longer on it but at this point I felt that prioritizing breath was more important than going that will let in medicine at some point that is just so much that you could learn that at some point you have to decide you know what I don't care about this level of detail on what I'm just going to focus on getting the big picture and I think with any other subjects as well it's really important to get the big picture first before about the details make especially with stuff like chemistry weather is called loudly tale or biology work and you can go to cuddle detail is that you know they would focus on trying to get really good at one topic and then really good another topic and then realize that. they might maybe you're doing it what works for me anyway is to become Vaguely Familiar with everything and then kind of start digging the detail down a bit more each time in real life caught a few times I sometimes volunteer for in the hospital set alarm 3 hours from 12 to 3 working on these Abominations that I was weakest on and by this point this was I think about 4 days before exam there was no topic that I was thinking that would be really really bad if it came up so I covered most of the whole to a reasonable amount of detail the weather going to be next was asking myself a k which topics am I not hundred percent confident in the threshold for what we revive color changes as we get closer custody, hopefully we will become more familiar with the content there for dinner instead of being okay if this came up I would fail and becomes more of us okay if this came up I probably only get 60% I did my first five minute break I was replying to you to come in send Instagram DMS on Instagram a crutch to help if you find that your kind of losing productivity and losing conservation button if you are in, the zone then there's no need to stick to any vitamin to Fashion it's completely okay to do 30 minutes 35 minutes as long as you're still having his own still focused election for an hour given by students from the oncology society which was a really good kind of revision of cancer stop it wasn't ready stuff that was going to come up in like them but I attended a lecture anyway cuz all my friends giving it and stuff we know we're not going to be examined on it cuz it's the kind of stuff that's important in real life as doctors pushed in a very small specific domain and have like really intellectual debates with your professor then having a professor Toshiba visors for you better but if you want to do well on your exams by far away your Dubai but whatever level of Education you're at but this calendar applies to a level spot University and Beyond arranged to give a lecture a religion lecture about a topic that you're doing yourself to your peers or two people a year younger than you well having almost deadline of being judged by your peers for delivering a hopefully decent teaching session Pacific spend hours and hours preparing lecture in advance cook some tuna pasta pesto with veg and then for the rest of the evening we had a fairly chills little group of a sensation in my room bit of chatting bit of doing better work I was quite relaxed and into the day where we were all Loki doing a bit of revision but doing in a group so that we only do it a bit more and had a nice time with it able to answer the questions even if you knew where the knowledge there was a sudden ways of answering the questions setting buzzwords that I'm looking for so I would say even though it's tempting to just go to your textbook do exam papers and I can't believe it. But it's all very well and good doing active recall in free active recall and writing everything you know about a chapter but when you put your exam in two or three weeks... it was actually doing them first and then looking in the Box games and seeing if you can learn learn what about what enzyme substrate complex text Marcus where she needs with sex words and even if you knew all the theory about enzymes in digestion it was just a 6-way idealistic phrases that you needed to get the dog say the examiners in GCC and A Tavola like really really dumb they're just going to follow the box came to the letter because they've got like a zillion papers to walk and it's pretty unfeasible for XR80 or whoever to hire like unit of University professors in biology tomorrow Biology papers so most likely little hopefully a biology teacher maybe even a random person who hasn't studied biology W X game I'd be looking specifically for you to nail this point I should have said that was in the clinical School library bashing through the examination that I have left to do before my come and spend the rest of the time having a relaxing evening with friends.

She says you look like you skip like that yes I absolutely skip like they are most kind of like day but I recently started working with a personal trainer who forces me to do the squats and deadlift with kettlebell every single time we work out and so hopefully I will start to the glass Lucy Hale says you go to six pack abs routine outside working on it but one day on Johnjay over one says you're insecure about your teeth I would say insecure about it but I want my teeth to look a bit straighter which is why do invisaligns now right now because they make me have a list when I speak Lucas says You must be workout with jeans leggings and Erin said you want to get hence so you can get one yes that's absolutely right I will be the first to admit that the main purpose in getting Hench is to become more attractive to women so yeah sorry Elsa's that you're moved by rational thinking no emotions could you be a cold-hearted person interesting emotions and Six GS says you are not emotional I think I feel like I rarely experience negative emotions and when I do I can choose to explain it away by Jen remove my moved in that move to change my mind things more by rational thinking than by emotions because that's just the way that I will pray read emotions things well I appreciate that could become harder and less colorful if you don't acknowledge your emotions and hang up gallery very bad appreciate do people who think Maggie for example you're very emotional person but you don't show it to dissolve says you're actually an emotional person that common real life and you cry often times and cry when I'm reading a book when I'm reading and listening to an audiobook and life is like really really really epic scene like towards the end of every Brandon Sanderson book in in particular just my eyes so nice you want to cry about stress so because you are stressed flashover work most of the time and Son of things I am too anxious to enjoy life I never basically never feel overworked I can't even remember the last time I felt stressed I don't really know the feeling of stress means because everyone but like basically everything I do it's with especially when it comes to like known medical-related thing I would be stressed if there were like serious medical situation going on I was doing if I can get hold of some senior support and stuff like that and that would be a stressful thing if I had like a long list of 20/20 things to do in their patients waiting the waiting room and then I'll be alright cool and see people in the most efficient and I said he never experienced chronic stress or anything like that was my foot that aside it's just that I feel like the secret to not burning out his ass to enjoy the stuff that you're doing and me a hangout I'm I'm lucky enough to be at the point where I almost never have to force myself to do something that I'm not enjoying do I say everything I do in life is fun set like working out when we're would like a stud to stud set of stuff but you can do it friends soap stream I trust has you're not friends with people who aren't good in studies what is a good in studies mean like most of the people I know who most of my friends in school was very good at sucking we're all nuts Addison's basically everyone I knew there was good at studies basically everyone in Friendswood now that I'm adults Act was their friends from work pretty good studying I have friends being surrounded by people who are most of my friends eczema who says you love making new friends but you rarely meet people have the same interests that is that of yours Play Welcome to Cambridge with them people and set some of those some of those people that I should become friends and people who would come and hang out with me and Cambridge all the people who have the same as of me an embarrassing remain I will become friends with other creative through YouTube and Twitter Instagram of the past few years and whatever there are the rainforests the fact that world creation of some sort like ties together in like a really nice way and so it feels like we have more shared interest even if maybe they don't intend to reproductive no taking as much as I am about me as a person so the first one is from book 1888 who says that you're lonely. Rad kumudha who says your Snopes keeping the negative connotations around the tub what is a person with exaggerated respect for high social position or well-received to associated with social superiors and looked does regarded as socially inferior respect people in the superior position even back in the day I don't really think I care about that stuff and looks down on those regarded as socially inferior I like to think of anyone I feel like I'm just like January very selfish and don't really think about other people so like if we accept Superior show me outside. Context PP are very judgemental even though you don't mean to me how much is mental I just do it again I just don't think about people in that way like if someone could not about what you doing with your life and I wouldn't think to judge you for doing that like if you're doing from the actual because of the people that always going to judge you for that but I don't think that's what it would just mess with me I think I'm awake all the time but it's entirely different in real life chicken game with other people some of us signal our social status and our identity and all these things by wearing an Apple Watch or wearing a hoodie or like the traditional way that people think that people single status is oh you've got a Gucci belt on Gucci trouser therefore you are signaling social status but like we're all doing it and when one way or another so I don't like in real life say that I'm a show from real life unless something is about to like self-aggrandizing hubristic and true happiness Define like happiness is like a mixture of pleasure in the moment and contentment in a long time I think I have a lot of fun in the moment I also think I'm reasonably content long-term so I think I am truly happy but whatever that means you still seem to lack yeah I think that's fair to say I don't really have a North star Compass purpose meaning of raison d'etre reason for me to be on this world I've I started thinking a lot more about that than I did in the past but I don't think I already have a soda so maybe that means I do like puppets but I would disagree that I lack true happiness and yeah nobody else says you still haven't found the purpose of your life I agree some people say that when this whole idea that every life is supposed to have world trying to make meaning analyzer a different ways I think I agree with that kind of viewpoints next we have good role says you get irritated by slow people for example slow conversations in real life where you, possible with the thing though I don't mind it when people speak slowly in real life it feels very natural I mind it when people speak slowly in Pakistan and videos because well then can speed Al but in real life the best of themselves and that's great but I was I would also enjoy helping others do something that I don't know something Cody Weissman like refund where by helping others you also recognize that you're actually making your own self feel good and so at any given Crossroads something I sometimes like to thank is okay what is the option here that would help most people and I know about the option is going to make me feel the best as well so occasionally I will choose. says you don't put much carrot appearances for example nice clothes shoes and hair products Exedra agree with that don't really care about hair products I don't need hair products maybe I should use hair products maybe that would make my hair look a little bit but yeah giving comments about how to hold a think I am Cheryl says you 602 Lewis St. Remy says I assume you 6.0 user 232 1307 says you'll find it to be 6 apply for 11 and a half but if I'm wearing shoes then that goes up to six foot and so obviously on my dating profiles I round up to 6 but cuz I think says you're a giver are you compassionate with skills generous and naturally kind you deserve a super party maleeha says you are super intelligent and very console thank you. I think I am pretty kind I maybe not come to myself x i maybe not kind to my immediate friends or family sometimes but I think I've been really kind to strangers and people known as well and I like to think the number has to be generous and stuff yeah I could be kind of to the kind of animated people strongly defined by your intelligence career status I felt like when I quit my job as a doctor temporarily I did lose some sense of identity is being a doctor but like I suppose that's curious cases like once you get get out of school University where you don't I could have during exams and stuff and I don't feel my intelligence whatever it might be expectations versus Weston life model I feel like my meat like my mom and my grandma and stuff we don't really do the Pakistani family expectations think I don't think so Jackie says you're not interested anymore there there are some aspects to the last one and right now like I did enjoy it was fun for the two years I was doing it full-time if I could choose to design life however I wanted it being a dog to 5 days a week would not be on that list if I could if I could Define the life and live it however I wanted to the maybe being a doctor of maybe two or three somewhere between one and three days a week I think that would be on the list so I enjoy being a doctor about would like to be doctor part-time ultimately because I think everything is more fun House of background lens caps makes someone wealthy but like depends what your what Your measuring stick is rimshot does rich kid background in that my mom has valued education above everything else and we didn't really have to worry about money to the extent that some people do so did I extend my background is extremely privileged and I'm very grateful for how many dollars in your checking account okay my definition of money doesn't really Act of the limiting factor in the experience you want from your life on a seat for me there a note the basic and I want that I need more money to buy it would be nice if I had like a super big house in London and then I can invite friends over but that doesn't keep me up at night in the distance if we're defining rich just the way I do find that money is not a limiting factor in my life experience then yes Chamillionaire yes hopefully will happen someday but I'm not admitting that right now all people's life and having a small to doctor the question of if you won the lottery would you still get up there and basically not a single person saying they will still do it full-time and the reason for the North during a full-time is because they don't have the money to quit that has led me to prioritize me my making passive income quite strongly in my own life because I think when you have money you have a freedom to then do do the work that you enjoy and I know those people who are doctors and don't enjoy it as a full-time job but they have to do it because of money and that's position that I never want to be in all I care about is getting rich then that's all I care about but it is a big papa these days I'm an unemployed bumper just makes internet videos so that's reasonably accurate just being recognized it's so good it's so nice when I'm like somewhere and people come and hang out with me and what I mean meet with me in person because it can be a bit open a time if it's like a very quick encounter when I don't know what to say if it but when people come to Cambridge to do my standing offer of all by anyone coffee that's actually really fun and I love talking to people and then we can have more of an extended discussion that way and matter said he will eventually maybe I will disabled but for now I think mutual benefits from consistency I'm a big proponent of consistency and everything in life okay if you do something about my brother now so we've got one from a j. C he says deep inside you know that table is the cuter and funnier brother inside the main security isn't inside the main generally I think if we feel like if we did but I put emoji on the school says that you are your mother's favorite child she would say that she doesn't play favorites lots and lots so we got this guy has never talked to a girl you've never been in a romantic relationship before your relationship is it history is dry and uneventful you've never had a girlfriend you didn't have a girlfriend you never had a relationship you've never liked a girl you've never been on a date for the same way more than once you've never dated you've never been through a heartbreak single your life if you don't have an excuse. Thank you for I was in was maybe about two or three months and then I got a pretty uneventful it's like I've been through a heartbreak actually went through a heartbreak in like 2012. Kind of felt like I haven't since I disagree with the framing of the friendzone if we defining friendzone as you friends with someone you like them and they just consider you a friend then that has happened once twice three maybe three or four times in my life is that a lot I don't know maybe this maybe Rachel says you don't have enough time to dates. Honey says you have no time to date Victoria Since you're so busy you may not have time to actually go into a relationship with a girl and just insisted she was so busy I seen you don't have time today Polly this is because it's it feels like too much effort partly ulcers cause a whole lot down thing in like when I decided hey I should take the dating thing a bit more seriously suddenly like coronavirus happened and then look down happened and so I haven't bothered with dating since then I don't have time it's like I think that's that's on the way I think of it if I'm not doing something it's not because I don't have the time it's because I'm actively choosing not to make the time and so may not bring them any dates and not being able to engage it's okay cuz I don't have time cuz I do I've got time to sit here all day making Instant Videos in cuz I choose to do other things that time so I don't particularly agree with that kind of framing but I don't have the time but choosy when it comes to girls that's why you're single fencing says you only date girls that are smart as you having studied IQ if we're accepting smartness and not particular framing of it which is next and then I probably wouldn't get along more with someone who is smart or as much or as little as much as I am like a similar level of smartness call me if I was significantly smarter than someone I imagine we probably won't get on that well so like this just had like what's like a friendship the people are generally across a lot of difference. if we're using it for the funny smallest mean IQ according to the studies is one of the best kinds of try to cross that sir you need a girls are smart do I think you're attractive and have been messed with meet him then like if that is a girl like me Tempe Corazon so you are shy with girls but at the same time quite picky potential love interest so all else being equal I would but if you do get moved by love women but you what's a Buddhist send it. Time for like the next 40 years like dating is basically numbers game for most of us most people that we meet do not fit those three pills of attractive again with them and I can see myself spending for 40 years ago and said that leads to all of us in dating game being picky about Carlos Rosario says you actually get many girls sliding in your DMs so you just reject them all honestly I don't really I don't even see out of my damn is because I like the way to Boston email married at lun.com and please send a photo because if you just tell me about you then Denise frrs this is too many check email me if you actually want to Wednesday me Cody Bri says you have a lot of dating options but signal that you don't like 35 likes on hinge right now 25 Maddie Maddie says you can actually get girls but you like to pretend that you done so you can see more #relatable meaning of lovely things groundhog says you smell like flowers and women love it I don't know Catherine Kennedy lovely guy and then I looked and personality in matching but whether we get home maybe that's about it but to be honest most of the girls or I see these days on dating apps we're actually it's very difficult to get to know someone's character through a profile on a dating app easier to see you make a snap decision of am I talking to this person and so for me kind of d looks at my practice here comes first and then the finality thing come secondary that's probably bad I probably should try to change that much thinking but it is what it is story of Belle you find girls who are into productivity more likeable / pots about Celestia you have a love interest you found a girl using this match you have a secret girlfriend you're in a relationship you in a relationship but pretend to be single you secretly have a girlfriend he he you have a secret girlfriend and you have a secret while a lot of people think I have a secret girlfriend for the record I do not have a secret girlfriend that's older it to say on that front Benito says you're moving to America to find a wife therefore this comes down to like personality match else being equal I'd be more likely to get on with some of his adult and someone who knows about it just because we probably have more things in common but I sent you wouldn't say no to mom says you are scared to be loved and honest as you can be insecure around women as well I can't remember the last time I felt insecure around a woman but if it would probably happen at some point you are scared to be loved original assumptions video what we talked about more about money at about relationships would seem to be the two most things that most people care about which I guess makes sense otherwise thank you for watching"

            "text": " in this video I'm going to summarize the key ideas from the book that's most changed my life before I was awake and then at the end of the video I'll talk about which bits personally resonated with me the most and how they single-handedly changed the course of my life okay so I know that the title because the title Please don't read this book is about how the life that we want is closer than we think it is in the first key idea is the difference between the difference and the new rich on one side will go eat the first which is like the old school way of thinking and people who sacrificed their lives to the idea of retirement these people might follow a more traditional path so they might work for 30 or 40 years and then retire at 65 deferred life plan which is that I'm going to work really hard while I'm young and in my physical Pro and then when I retired then I'll be able to enjoy life then on the other side we've got the new Rich again don't think too hard about the word itself but these are the people who have a more new school approach to life I ate they try and leave the retired lifestyle throughout their life and they tend to alternate kind of periods work the fun pairs of holiday and the goal of this group is to free up that time and their location which automatically makes the money was ten times more I want to be able to spend time doing whatever they want instead of having to rely on their work now this audio of new Rich was a pretty Claudia went in first bus yesterday in 2006/2007 this is now become much more mainstream and we have all these digital Nomads and you know the Creator economy the passion economy I am to an extent also dipping the I'll wear the stuff that I'm doing isn't directly tied to a location and therefore if I want when it's not look down I can travel around the world and what for my laptop and make more money doing that then I could in my day job is working as a doctor and he's dated like hundreds of thousands of millions of people around the world especially with the whole remote looking thing being accelerated thanks to the continent between periods of Perry the rest I'm going to try and distribute these many retirements throughout a life rather than working very very very hard for 40 years and then saving retirement up until when was 65 when we have osteoarthritis in both bunnies less is not laziness leverage our time so that we can get like acceleration results with only a small amount of time actually spend time doing another system do more the timing is never right most of us are in this mode where we're kind of traps and the life we have and the reason that we say we do want to do something else is because the timing isn't quite right so it's not the right time to get my not the right time to have kids it's not the right time to switch to remote where I can go to Vacation whatever temperature stays good thing in the book the timing is never ever going to be right and you just have to do the thing and figure the rest out along the way and visit my quote where he says that waiting for Sunday will take dreams to great room number for S6 forgiveness rather than permission is one of my mattress that I'd find it by as Bernie Sanders and then we going to rule of five emphasize your strengths don't try too hard to fix your weaknesses this is the one that I disagree with but Tim Ferriss point is that you know just more of the things that you're good at where you are uniquely placed to leverage up your time and your skills don't worry too hard about trying to be good absolutely everything I just agree to an extent because I think for example I was really bad at public speaking back in the day I didn't really know how to if I put a temperature device to the letter I wouldn't be focusing on those weaknesses that are strengths and playing oral sex is a nice one and that money alone is not the solution lot of us think that I can't do X because I don't have the money and like kind of the whole point of this book is that the reason that we want to be rich generally because it's not because of the money itself it's because we want to be rich lifestyle that people have where it's like a I can light travel around the world and stuff that you can actually do the stuff that you think you want to do a lot cheaper than you think cannot leave them to rule number 7 which is that relative income masses for more than absolute and relative set both money and time crucially as being overdoses whereas needed first the old school way of thinking is to just think about money as a resource with my mom about this because she's very much money is the main resource and I'm very much and so she can't fathom why I would order takeaway everyday to save a time and I can't find them why she would drive three hours out of the way to save 10% on the Halal meat to save money that's about the place where the two of us don't really see eye-to-eye but you stress is good distress is the type of harmful stressed out over a long amount of time makes us weaker where is eustress is that kind of stretch Zone where would just stepping outside of my comfort zone but things are not like full-on panic mode and so you stress is what helps us grow or is this dress is what the first key idea of the book The Eight rules for joining the new Rich all the new school wave approaching life and then for the rest of the book he talks about a full pot method for getting to this point where you are part of the new rich and not follow the acronym DEA MD stands for Define and the other Harris. If you want to be part of the new Rich it's worth defining your fears and also defined in your dreams Define what you actually want to get out of life first victim verse talks about the idea of mitigating fear he said that it's fair that stopping us from trying out talking about that and he says that most of us would rather be unhappy then uncertain like we're so scared of the unknown was so scared of that even if we're unhappy where we are right now we prefer the certainty of being unhappy rather than the uncertainty of trying out something if you want to be part of the new Rich then you want to split this and instead choose uncertainty over on happiness like I would rather be uncertain than unhappy have 6 questions that useful for us to ask I don't follow step by step but I've kind of Incorporated these into my wife thinking and so now whenever I find myself not doing something because I'm scared I do kind of run through mentally through the 6 questions and then I realized I'm just too much of a scaredy-cat I just need to do what are the things you're not doing because you're scared what are you missing out on by not doing those things why aren't you what's the absolute worst case scenario has happened how would you fix it and if you wanted to go back to how everything was before you made a change you do it through my mind when I got approached by a publisher a few months ago asking if I would be interested in writing a book I was very scared I was like oh my God I think it's bad reviews and what if no one likes and what if people are like off play. And I thought he spoke to a few friends but if you mentors and also run this through like what I'm actually scared of people don't like not doing this when I'm older probably therefore I should just write this book and that was kind of the third president made me different unit Society of writing but if you want to follow along my journey that links to my book email list which is where every few weeks I'll post it update an awesome questions and give you some samples if you're interested in the video description but now I'm kind of going back into medicine part-time but that was initially because if I suck what if they see through unless they think I'm a fraud and all over this. I kind of lost my selfies worst case scenario Fiesta some questions that temporary Define the next step is to define or ambitious goals and the Hare and a mental model that I still used today instead of thinking we should be thinking about what would make us it's because it's quite a quite hard to think about and what will make us happy like I'm quite happy doing what I'm doing right now I'm making making videos but it wouldn't say I'm picky excited by it but if anybody but if I'm doing that encourages me to take more risks and do more risky things that will probably lead to more interesting things happening further down the line so optimizing for excitement rather than just happiness and he's got a sample exercise things that you want to have five things that you want to do and Fife do you want to be in that generates 15 dreams for us not from those 15 rims won't use the top four and then we're going to come up with three action items for each of these dreams and crucially want to do the first action right now. This process is what I adapted for my 2021 goal setting thing that made about Italy pair of that somewhere where to find that you know what this year I really want to become good at concept art and therefore you know what are The Accidental steps I can take right now well you know I can practice all day everyday I can get an art teacher I can sign of these online courses and now I've actually been doing since January and I've definitely noticed an improvement and it's really fun doing. So all is one of those areas in which I said having never done it before and now I'm seeing progress important because he says we should do the first action right now I think that is one area in which like New Year's resolutions in this other stuff generally Falls flat because it's very easy to set goals but if we bought ourselves to take the first action right now as soon as it really accelerate our progress and does not quit from the book hair temporary said that all of the most important things the timing always sucks the Stars will never line on the traffic light of life will never old and green at the same time the universe doesn't cancel against you but it doesn't go out of its way to line up all depends either conditions are never perfect someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the Grave with you if it's important to you and you want to do it eventually just do it and correct course along the way so that was D4 defined Potter acronym Izzy for eliminate and this is all about eliminating the things that take up too much of a time and don't add very much value to us 15 years ago expands to fill the time allocated to it and so would this video for example I was meant to film this video last week but because I gave myself a whole day to do it I actually never got it done whereas today I'm doing myself 1 hour to film this video and now it's been. Next we have to pray principle which is 80% of the results come from 20% of the inputs again the first time I heard about this was reading before I woke but it's not the few leads to the majority of the results until we want to be as much as possible what is the 20% of actions that's going to give us the 80% of results and I find myself using us and also when it comes to overcoming perfectionism in anything that I do online when it came to studying for my medical school exams does loads of like minutiae that will give you maybe an extra 10% of the box but the bulk of the Moxie 80% comes from the core 20% of the content so the more you can kind of focus on that the more efficiently you can get stuff done so hostile similar together so for example instead of doing laundry every day you would do it like once a week or once every other week when you can do it all in one go that's like a really simple example in a life where we can apply this for example my husband and I do grow shopping once a week by a click-and-collect this is a productive and efficient way of doing the groceries rather than going to the shop every day like some of my friends will sit with emails like emails of the sort of thing that we just check basically every hour of the day but we can batch or checking emails in the morning and evening if we want to nothing really important is going to sit through the cracks if we only check email twice a day but it does Prius up to be more productive in other areas of my life so that Define and eliminate then we have ultimate that is a very interesting because this is not building a system that he talks a lot about building a kind of internet business in this and how you can automate things so that either computers or other people can working for you rather than you having to put in all that work yourself and one way of doing this is As He suggests in the book to hire a virtual assistant this has become more popular in the last 15 years but still is kind of underrated I think Tim Ferriss was the first one to ready mainstream inside his idea of having a virtual assistant that's the idea that you can pay someone to do the sort of things for you that you'd rather not do yourself thank someone in a different country like for example in the Philippines or something where if you pay them five or six dollars an hour that's like absolutely huge and like a ridiculously high salary for them but it's also probably a lot less than you making your own job if you have a job there for yeah you can take advantage of this Geo Arbitrage where you can get a bunch of assistant who can help you do stuff which frees up your in time to make more money or do more of what he loved and I've tried using virtual assistants in the past when I was building my company sickness Philippines to help out with stuff in the UK getting one I was like oh my God what's the present is it who has insisted that really like if you're an entrepreneur or if you have a business or something and you will time is worth a certain amount you can and should pay someone who makes less than that to take stuff off your face that lets you focus example video my time is Northwest very much when I am in booking flights or ordering groceries online or doing the laundry and ironing my clothes and things are things that I can bury Outsource because it frees up my own time to do the high leverage things in my business obviously there are caveats here you know you don't want to answer with every aspect of your life there is something to be said for not doing manual labor and washing the dishes and watching the washing clothes and stuff laundry is why we have a dishwasher and why recently outsourced my laundry as well to an external provider amuse this is like Muse is like a business of Lifestyle business so business it doesn't take too much of your own time to operate but that makes reasonable money and this is sort of related to the idea of passive income really there's no such thing as truly passive income which is why I always act never I say the phrase passive income the key is to find a niche market and offer a service to that market and then build systems and people in a way that means you don't have to spend your own time in delivering that service and it was when I read this that ready help me get to the point of setting up my first company that was very much a lifestyle business I was probably working less than 4 hours a week at the business and it was making like a very reasonable full-time living to me while I was in med school and that was basically directly thanks to all the advice the Tim Ferriss Ted in the 4-Hour Work week so thank you the final part of the deal acronym is elephant liberates and this is when you know you've got all the pins lined up with your automated Muse on your virtual assistants on the fact that you're now turning more productive because of Parkinson's the cycles of your full-time job if that's what you want or you can liberate yourself from the shackles of working in your business rather than on your business. Didn't end up happening what a nice having a business that could very comfortably support my lifestyle while not having to go to work everyday and again before I work week this idea of financial Independence passive income this is for me is really been my Northstar for the lost like 8 years ever since I read the book as I was going through med school I always had to send back my mind thinking okay you know my dream life is where medicine is optional and where I can work as a doctor if I want to but where I don't have to and it was basically like all the stuff that I learned in this that helped me get to this point where I live now these multiple streams of passive income is multiple musical lifestyle business or whatever you want to call it if you're interested in doing the same I would recommend you read the book it does have a lot of like tools and services and apps and stuff in it and so it is a little bit out of date and there's lots of sections when he recommends. you can eat udinese skip over this section like a butt looks quite big but if you skip over those like now day sections the advice and it is still really really good but you do have to look past the somewhat arrogant tone that a lot of people say he comes up and easy the medicine self 15 years ago I had a different Spotify thing so look Beyond The Superficial stuff and you'll find like a treasure Trove about to go in here if you're not sold reading the book anyone I would recommend the service short form and show phone is this new service which is now my favorite way of reading summaries of books it's a lot more detailed than blinkist or other things that are tried in the past and actually we use the short form summary of this Facebook to construct the script for this week until I started using short form a few weeks ago and really really liking it and then I became friends with the founder of it and they've created this like really nice affiliate partnership for us so if you go down video description cut it short phone.com you will get some freebies and you'll get like a discount or something like that check it out Nicki Nevada description if you care about reading summaries of books one wanting reading a summary of a book is not a substitute for actually written about himself and again this is a very good very good book you should read a link it down below as well but often what I like to do is before reading a new book I will summary of it on short form first and then I'll say okay cool now I can read this but I've got more of a big-picture idea for the whole book is about anyway this is one of the three books as most changed my life the other two are show you what battles Pantheon and anything You Want by Derek sivers and I have a video over here that will summarize those three books that changed my life for you so definitely check that out little people have watched that video and said that they've got those recommendations at that video change that life will see you in the next"

so I'm not using those notes that I making myself to build a teaching session for my students which saves me a lot of time I continue in this vein for the 45 minutes continuing to build up the revision presentation with these different sources and then by half past 12 I find myself losing concentration so I lie on the sofa for a few minutes doing absolutely nothing and then decide to stop being a wise man and do some quick exercises to get heart rate up and to bring me one step closer to my dream of becoming a gymshark athlete once my arms of feeding sufficiently swallow a head over to the bedroom for change of scenery I change into my David dobrik merch hoodie that become my favorite hoodie whole time and I crawl into bed with my MacBook Pro I spend a few minutes replying to YouTube comments because I'm such a nice guy and then get back to work in the next 45 minutes I finished the revision presentation and so from 1:15 to 2 p.m. I added a script of an episode of book

vegetating on my phone I considered filming a new video briefly my grandma calls me from Pakistan and tells me off for posting so many YouTube videos and it pulls me to focus on medicine instead off of the child decide to give myself just 5 more minutes of doing absolutely nothing which inevitably turns into more than an hour of doing absolutely nothing I take a brief break to empty because the house is at 7 p.m. I get back on the sofa this time Switching gears to my iPad Pro and continue working through the script for the atomic Habits video I'm using notion and Kindle in split-screen to get quotes from running an errand to the book by half-past seven script is finally finished ready to film so I just have to take a break and cook for myself yes that's right friends if I want to

on Netflix I'm actually still pretty hungry after this home cooked meal because obviously they never give you big enough portion sizes so I ordered additional take away for the evening and proceeded to watch another seven episodes of money Heist that goes the dream of becoming a gymshark athlete has been a pretty long time to be honest in something the TV show business like this morning haven't told myself just one more episode like four times in a row and then takes me another hour to actually get to best because I have to upload the files from this block to Google Drive out of course waste

Leave or swap it round that's the thing I find most difficult bring up a soul in my life I've lived forever life with basically no adversity and slightest you no thank you Mom for what's the story I mean I have some challenges growing up I had a very good childhood and a very loving parents good school accessories Define I did spend time in hospital when I was a child and three my teenage years which I guess who made was pretty big challenge of the time and still is to some extent why were you in the hospital what happens to have chemotherapy and mixtures quite into drugs with milk the different side effects for about three months and then after that I have to have a femur replacement so I had my say my hit fit the FEMA was replaced say that was initially when I was 10 years old and then also that various things went wrong and I have to have Replacements old hip replacement and eventually this part of the hip as well with reply I was ten when I was diagnosed say that I was in UK tef5 so I miss most of his life through with that and then you 6 I have to have another operation so I missed half of that you 7 don't initiate same time there's one else because I'm coming a bration say I'm a stalker that swell and then I think I went to the right Stacy is I had another operation I think he were living I was at school the whole time hip replacements in your life today as I was before that I feel like we're fast it probably made me interested medicine I think I was selling Tiffany way up until that point I'd always enjoyed silent night so I don't think it's changed it just showed me a possible career and I wasn't so exposed to it but it made me much more likely I'm more interested to go into anything so I would say that have had a huge impact because it's called they want their mom doing and I think it has maybe with the question about living in the moment I think it's it has made me more like that to some extent in the I do really appreciate good things that happening around man good people now but then I also think is it does the other way as well in that it makes me V if he should move because I know that things are going wrong in the palace they went in the future so I think it's complex every part of my you can take it back to normal now say that my am so paralyzed in my foot and other things but his walking stick around a wheelchair for game for a field so physically know I'm normal I'm very used to this day my no more now having had all these like challenges which I've never experienced like anything anything near that magnitude from strange because when I look back at my childhood I it's not sad to me I look back and I think of this amazing Charles that I had and I think that is a testament to my family and my friends in the people here around me supporting material because I was waiting I can't have those people I'm not support network I'm traumatized as I think I could have been but I definitely at the teenager a struggle to huge mountain with the same as other people around me I have to do the same things as one else seemed very different and I think that teenagers feel that way anyway about something but me my thing was my disability which became the thing I should say sit down then and maybe have very low self-esteem at that time for anyone growing up with any kind of advice to take a Sprite Rick a support network is best thing I guess I mean I have to mention about a lot an is a charity that runs a free activities for children with disabilities and they are in that direction after FEMA operations and Play Accept Balls to self go to this activity weather very setup for people with various needs illnesses that still has some cells that are very safe I'm and you got to just do amazing things I get to do horse riding or climbing or things that you just a visit a real person or an ill child wouldn't be able to do and that I sent today started the process of building up my confidence and learning that even though I wasn't available at all the people I could find a way to do things and so I think that is a huge part now of my mentality in when I come struggle or something I can do as well as someone else I try to find a way around it and find a new way to do it and I today have really tried not to let my disability stop me did you ever have self-doubt in your life says Ready Shelton worried I think we're worried that you're not getting off that you're not doing a good enough job that you won't achieve the things you set out to do that you disappoint on the people or things have you ever had cell phone don't think too hard about outcomes because winning the race would then be being outcome dependent where is competing in the ricin doing my best as what matters to me and so I have no Self Doubt about me I doubt I'll be able to do my best because I know I'll do my best. that we will win the race because it seems totally pointless to think about the outcomes example not doing a good enough job like other dogs that do you feel these by how often you feel except like self-doubt what does that mean Phoenix Raceway where is all I would take a much more pressing me because every time we change rotation says don't tell us we have to change in your past few years at before you move to a different specialty it feels almost like you're getting back to the beginning and you suddenly don't know where anything is how logistically to organize things like scans or blood test to think that. because receptor I would in those times think that is me that's the problem even though it was looking at the outside situation you would think you want a new job you're not going to be so good but I would have stopped every time I stop at a full month. And thank am I ever going to get better at this is it me that's being really slow to live when I was thinking I'm being really slow where is he would have seat go in and just just me but you would go in and say I can completely rationalize why this is happening and it's not medicine system that's all I don't need to worry about it five times now why for this new scenario. Seem to cycle happens again I think for me I need more I need to build up more evidence to myself to prove that it's not me but for you I think you inherently like understands that the system can cause he sings what if you look for an alternative explanation other than I am a folk remind myself each time before I go into the cycle of time off myself and that's fine but I wouldn't feel so good like self self Delta nuts and some like a mistake I know what I'm doing next time it's fine cuz I would take every mistake I made for a pessimist I'm thinking that reflects on me how did you and Molly picon flatmates where is he June April May 2018 and like from from that moment I was like right eye glitter ball many conversations with my family only way to get bored worried about living with you what I hate you what you been doing Etc my grandma wasn't because my grandma theory was that what if people think that you'll together and then No One's Gonna want to marry you because they think you could have girlfriend that was my grandma's so he sits on that front I think that's why do most Mary what is the usual reason behind this fight how often do we fight weather nieva properly fold two or three times Destiny 2 or 3 times in 8 years like the gram but I feel like you're becoming more more okay with more of that now for the time what happens if you get tired of seeing each other dating the house when we're bison house we die nice thing about living with someone that you already know really well is that you know I can get home from walk in front of a computer in Medicare but very occasionally it doesn't get too much how do you guys cook at home with eat take out with your schedule too close to beating up take away I think this year over half of my meals have been takeaways I've eaten a home-cooked meal in the house fewer than 10 times this year everything else I ate if you could take away or I eat at work breakfast is getting coffee in the morning and then lunch I would have work and then dinner if I'm working a long day always had to work or if you come home and you never put anything by anything and the rest of the time I will cook and I'll take things to work for lunch so I didn't quite understand so I'll take like but emails or I'll cook a big ham pastor and then take it the rest for lunch the next day but I wouldn't say I cook because other interesting recipes or anything I just make pasta fish cakes extra half an hour of time I don't have to think about food or cooking or cleaning up and then stuff that's an extra half an hour of time I could put into making YouTube video and just because of the Staggering difference in what the value of my time is making YouTube video voice of the body of my timer take away I just met that makes absolutely no sense to be thinking about food and washing up when I could be spending the time I can get you to do iMac not toasting itself I maybe I have like few of the puppies I would spend money on safe food I treat as hoping set India in the Aladdin original film the cartoon when Jasmine is like chained up budget for Crush childhood Crush I'm trying to think I mean Zac Efron he still might I don't crush

effort to like maintain that relationship was with you I literally have zero in this life and what gear did Molly use did they say an Italian influence on purchasing Tech taking me back with your

I used to with the paper pool with the paper like they want so yeah everything's about it is the same it's pretty much a no-brainer to get the paper light they sold thousands of units around the world and two autistic students and in a graphics people in web designer himself who old swear by it I've been using it every single day for the last like 2 years and now the V2 is even better so if you want to grab it on Kickstarter if you support the kickstarter project get like 10 euros off the retail price so put an Affinia thing down in the description below so if you buy it through there when I'm supposed to be for a cup of coffee then the price goes up to like 35 Euros off to the painting over so I'll make a video about this like it's like doing a full-on review and explaining things in depth but I just wanted to put this up to let you guys know that you have an iPad or not formula that work and just makes it better and when you spending so much money on the iPad like Mega spending your life pretty much on your iPad all things except like video editing and coding I do everything in my apartment so having a screen protector that makes parents just that little bit nicer it's absolutely worth it in my opinion. not that I'm going to be coming soon so hold on hold on to your voice about thank you for watching I'll see you in the next video"

revamping my living room to make it a less productive but hopefully more fun space anyway I intend in the day at 8:30 but because I was up late last night doing a coding livestream on Twitch I turn my alarm off and probably go back to sleep next thing I know I'm being woken up at 9:45 buddy online grocery delivery dude because I'm an environmentalist use disposable bags so yeah we are bringing the food into the kitchen cleaning the fridge so that it's Sparkles putting food into the fridge brushing my teeth showering changing and making a cheeky cup of coffee with my Chemex on fancy-ass variable temperature kettle that was a gift from YouTube celebrity James Hoffman then I sat down for a healthy breakfast of black coffee and leftover pizza from the week before working towards my ultimate goal of becoming a gymshark athlete at 11 a.m. I sit down to munch on my pizza and figure out what I want to do for the day one of my team members send me a draft of an upcoming video to approve so I checked that out and I'm pretty impressed by the way he's put it together then at 11:30 I take a quick trip to take out the trash because the house is starting to smell and then I get back to work I stationed myself in the corner of the living room with my iPad the way in editing the structure for Book Club episode about Ryan holidays book The obstacle is the way of course I'm using notion on one side of the screen and I've got the Kindle app open on the other side which is my preferred way of taking notes from books I finish up the script and then spend a few minutes pointless going through Twitter and at this point it's 1 p.m. so I take a quick break to make a cup of tea and put away the laundry like the domestic legend that I am off that I even put a new bin liner in the kitchen bin I know my Ingenuity amazes me to then I sit back at my Desta continue doing some writing I plug away editing the script for an upcoming video about Jay Shetty book think like a monk which takes me around 40 minutes and then I got a call from my grandma in Pakistan and so we have a chat over WhatsApp video at 2:30 I head over to Cambridge railway station my friend James and after bit of food we
