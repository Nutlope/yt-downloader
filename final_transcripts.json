the list we have a physical alarm clock that is really cool because before I had one of these are used to use my phone as an alarm clock can I have the phone on my bedside table but inevitably it would mean that I would spend hours and hours scouring through 5th Rising Instagram and attempting to reply to messages on hinge at night when I should have been sleeping but ever since I got one of these physical alarm clock on my bedside table across the room away from my bed or even in the kitchen on charge if I really need to get up one morning and so for a relatively cheap investment of like between 5 and 20 quit depending on have fun to get on for kids you can mess up the improve your quality of sleep if you get one of these the trustee electric toothbrush now the only thing that you need to have in an electric toothbrush if you have one it needs to have a 30-second timer to the cool thing about this one is that you go and then every 30 seconds it does like a send it so it tells you when 30 seconds are up and it tells you when 2 minutes are up so you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of the mouth and then you know when you been brushing for 2 minutes I've been using this

ukulele when I was in my second year of medical school and ready it was the first instrument that I learned I learned by following YouTube tutorials I just really like the idea of playing guitar with ukulele seemed 15 quid off Amazon it was easier to get started with the ukulele and within like 10 minutes you can learn to play the basic chords and then if you practice around 5 or 10 minutes a day for about a week or two if you get to a point where you can like play songs on the ukulele and you can like sing along Annie ukulele was ready my gateway drug into the world of music easy to learn would highly recommend a link to a cheap version on Amazon and video description you can basically get the cheapest one learn how to play that and then if you want you can upgrade to a slightly fancier one but yeah 15lb for my basics play it was pretty old somebody got me into the world music at number six on the list we have my absolute favorite writing pad of all time this is the puck up had like I've tried zillions and zillions of like writing and I always keep coming back to the park because it's like the quality of the paper and the quality of The Vibes and the feel and the look and the general spiritual Essence that puts out it's just like Second To None I quite like the basic acapella portex version which has the same quote a paper but goodies like dividers cuz I've got more money I can afford like slightly better stationary and so this is how I've been kind of planning the book that I'm writing Penn's right to the wooden within Arm's Reach inside of a Heavenly to write anything down this this is something nice about Daniel to scriba lights on a full pack of had rather than have to write it in a nap so highly recommend easy the Fantastic the best path I've ever used number 6 on the list we have a Trilogy of books by Austin play on all these are fantastic the very good and very inspirational and I have them I have like physical copy of all three on my desk at all times as part of my desk setup in particular has changed my life encourage me to write online a video over there if you want to check that out feel like an autistic school about stealing ideas like an autistic to talk about the general idea that nothing is original we don't need to worry about having original ideas we can steal like autistic and get ideas from different sources nothing is original chapter that says the rights of Jonathan lethem is said that when people call something original nine times out of 10 they just don't know the reference is all the original sources involved but keep going it's all about how to stay creative through the good I'm so it's like a really nice like it's very cheap vinyl it takes like 20 minutes to read each of them and I've heard of these are very well 12th thumb through so anytime I'm having a bit of a creative rats or I'm in a bit of a slump I just pick up one of them my death kind of a grab one eye open to a random page and I always find inspiration to thank you Austin for that links the oldest books down in the video description that goes with the vibe of the rest of my desk is it's been amazing because now I drink so much more water and drinking water as they say is good for you and I've noticed that on days when I drink more water I feel less but I feel less bloated and my skin feels like it's glowing not sure how much of that but yeah we went to a medical school that you should drink smoothies as well as having a deck of cards the lost almost 10 years of my life doing close-up magic in 2011 after watching the top with Michael Vincent on Penn and Teller fool us off as a way of trying to increase my sexual market value amongst my peers of school but then when I go to university and reinvented myself as not a mess I decided to continue with my close-up magic and I used to perform at bulls and parties and events around the University I got to go to be looking like hey you want to see a magic trick that was that was my jam back in the day and even though like I always have it all to me because if I ever need something to do with my hands then I'll just do some partial for the debit card because otherwise the devil what violence at 3 we have the Amazon Kindle you can get these quite a bit for the most expensive item on the list but like the cheapest times and Kindles they sometimes like 50 or $60 you can get it honestly getting a Kindle lets you to give you the ability to read infinitely more books than you would otherwise these days anytime I get a book recommendation I just buy on Kindle immediately and I can start reading it there and then it's just absolutely amazing I've been using a Kindle Jason's 2008 everyone candle depending on how much money you want to save and I read this every night before bed it's what I do when I get into bed I tape my mouth shut off to do my skincare routine read on the Kindle until I fall asleep so huge huge huge impact on my quality of life with a fairly cheap very small device Eagles number two we have this this is a doorstop I probably got the most bang for my buck out of this purchase than anything else in my life because when I was at University I always used to have a doorstop I would have my door open these days probably not so relevant you are in a coded signs in the pandemic but once the world stop sending highly recommended or stop after the everyone or if you have noticed or if your home State University Persona where are your friends who woke or woken by feel like it's okay to interrupt you while you're working because like a pilot back when I get to best experience I don't remember those nights where I was like oh I put a work a little bit harder to get like an extra 1% on this essay but because I was a little person who people would feel comfortable interrupting in the middle of look like those interactions and does like welcome distractions turn into friendships that still lost in today and so if you'll just one person who broke the door open with a stop at University or wherever you are it is generally Good Vibes around and finally at the top of this list one purchase that has immeasurably improved my quality of life

            "text": " friends welcome back to the channel in about nine different ways that you can make passive income if each of those I'm going to talk about how hard it is to get started how hot is to make $100 a month from it and how hard it is to maintain once you've created the thing in the first place for me and my business different sources generate around $27,000 per week these days with varying degrees of passiveness and obviously this is taking me like eight years to build up so don't expect to be hitting those with the numbers when he first started I would have had when I started my Jenny many many years ago let's go for a passive income I always act quote it because there was really no such thing as passive income there is no way to make money without doing anything at all but what I say passive income what I mean is that it's money that is not directly tied to what time let's say you were to write a book if you write a book you publish a book that book is now and bookshelves you've done the work kind of wants to write and publish the book but now anytime the book sells you make money from royalties that is passive income you can literally be making money while you sleep because this thing which is out in the world which is generating income for you always takes a very long time to get going so if you see any ads before this video talking about how you can get rich quick by whatever scheme or if you see people in the comments pretending to be me saying you're so you can get rich quick with crypto WhatsApp this number that is all this, it's not going to work there is no way to get rich quick it is not a thing so if you're looking for a get-rich-quick scheme of things that don't exist so you might as well not even try and do I think of this is that ultimately money is just a medium exchanging value the only way to make money is to provide value and the only way to make passive income passive money is to provide value in a way that is not directly tied to your time so please please do not try and get rich quick scheme they don't exist I've had lots of messages over the years from people who have try setting up to a get-rich-quick crypto scheme or a gambling scheme or a hey here is how you going to play poker online none of these things ever work people always end up losing money the only way to make money is by providing value on so let's talk about the nine different ways that you could provide. I want to tell you that I've just launched my brand new still check laws about productivity for Creative how to start a successful side hustle that's Link in the description skills for a sponsoring this video will tell you more about it later on but I want to plug my own class because and it will help you get tips on how you can start side hustle in your spare time anyway let's get into the video and is an Awakening a form of value and so when we give our money to a company in the form of buying the stocks it makes sense that we would get some kind of return for that investment and was telling me this because investing in stock is the easiest way to make any kind of passive income if you have the savings and they're sitting in a savings account earning 0.01% interest then already doing very much for you if you had this day savings and put them in stocks you could potentially be running passive income from the money that's otherwise just sitting there going to be late other there somewhere I said that is a solid half an hour. Option to stop exactly how they work but the thing that I recommend for most to get us as a non financial advisor steal my money that's in stocks and shares is invested in index funds not Index Fund is something like the S&P 500 and when you invest $1,000 in the S&P 500 u.s. so you waited by how big they are so like you know 2% of it would be an apple 2% in Facebook 2% in Google to Poseidon Microsoft and then you probably want to go to the 500 company on the list but basically all the big us companies you end up investing in a little bit of time so if you want you can use webull I think of gold link in the description if you're in the UK you can use free trade or Vanguard country ranges Google the phrase best stock broker platform fuel pump relay manual fi what's the UN is very easy to be able to invest in an index fund so it wouldn't all famous side hustle assessment Matrix we going to give the difficulty of starting a 1-star rating 1 out of 5 is very very easy to get started with stock how hard is it to make $100 a month investing in stocks do this kind of depends because it depends on the performance of the stock market over also in the last 12 months from 2020 to 2021 the S&P 500 actually increased by about 50% that is a 50% everything going on so if in April 2020 you had invested $2,400 in the S&P 500 by 50% means you would have made $100 a month. what time. You looking at but if we average on the Loft study 250 years the S&P 500 has had a roughly ten point something percent return with mean every year on average over the long-term and goes up by around 10% this is no inflation adjusted for any equipment back-of-the-envelope calculations if we want to add a hundred dollars a month passively through stocks and shares we would need around about $12,000 invested in the S&P 500 to make that 10% 1200 if you put in $7,500 in the S&P 500 and you left it there for five years and five years later you would be making roughly $100 a month if we go by this very average figure of 10% a year if you invested $5,000 making $100 a month in purely passive income again assuming the 10% average so overall how hot is it really to make $100 a month in passive income from stocks depends on how hard is it for you to make 5000 7500 $12,000 in savings and put them into a Index Fund this is money that you shouldn't need to touch in the next 5 to 10 years at least so basically how easy is it for you to The Miz make money comedian average salaries run about $50,000 something like that but give this roughly a 3 out of 5 star rating for difficulty of getting $100 a month if you live in a country where the average salary is $3,600 a year and very very difficult to make $10,000 in savings overall once you set up in the first place I'm going to give this a one-star out of five because once you got the money and you just like set it and forget it and it's not that hard to maintain their other sources of passive income that require High degrees of Maintenance overtime but stocks and shares is a very very easy make passive income example these days my stocks and shares portfolio which I've been investing in since 2015 is now worth around about $350,000 and the majority of that is in the S&P 500 Index Fund a very very rough average of 10% a year then that averages out to around $682 per week in purely passive income Academy Bank in the video description where I teach people how to do this whole thing so let's use of side hustle assessment Matrix and we'll talk about this how hard is it to start a YouTube channel well I'm going to get this one out of five stars because it's actually very very easy to youtube.com you could create a channel you going to play videos for this building with your phone and uploading it harder to make good videos and making good videos of how you grow on YouTube but getting started on YouTube is very very very sprinkle with the real question is how hard is it to actually make real money from YouTube again let's say we want $100 a month in passive income to be eligible for monetization on YouTube you need a thousand subscribers and 4000 hours what time it took me six months and 52 videos to get my first 1000 subscribers on average 90 something videos to get to a thousand subscribers so that's quite hard if you're thinking you're going to get there to be able to do this for a very long. Of time at least once a week I say for at least two years before you can expect anything in return but that's how you hit your time how hard is it to actually make $100 a month thousand views on YouTube is run about $2 so this very massively but let's say on average about $2 per thousand views before if you want $100 a month you need 50,000 views on YouTube to make $100 I mean every video you make needs to get around about 12,500 views on very roughly the average YouTube channel can expect around about 20% of that subscribers to equal the average view count for each video on YouTube if you had 62,000 subscribers averagely you can expect 20% of 12500 views on each video and it's evening you have no Evergreen content of the longtime you need a ride about 60,000 subscribers to be making $100 a month 10000 something subscribers like it was it was very early on but when it comes to assessing how hard it is to do I'm going to give this a 4 out of 5 Stars it's actually very hard to make a compelling YouTube videos and it's very easy to get started but it's hard to do well the great skill sets refund you get to meet people across the internet you got to learn how to talk to a camera and how to film and video editor but it's very hard to actually make money from YouTube go to thousand subscribers and what's your channel is growing it means you've landed on a formula that works and so maintaining it then becomes easier than starting from scratch and maintenance of a YouTube channel passive income stream to be right about 2 out of 5 stars sample I made 70 videos before I started making any money from YouTube AdSense these days the YouTube channel makes around about $12,000 a month in passive income from YouTube AdSense now again this is because I keep on uploading videos but actually the bulk of the amount of generate from ads is from older videos rather than videos that are open that were updated this month so with that caveat $12,000 a month passive income $3,000 a week stop but it doesn't really count as passive income for YouTubers why not including this in this side hustle assessment cost of cells don't really have a algorithm that's helping them grow and find a little podcast grow by having a YouTube channel which is kind of how hot is it you can park your phone around between you and your friends and you can start a podcast you can use web cycle Riverside do I found that I recently invested in as an angel investor Riverside makes it very easy to record remote podcast interviews is very very easy $100 a month in passive income from a podcast passive income because the way podcast is make money is by relying on Brad's Deals there is no YouTube AdSense for podcast and so you need a sponsorship for a brand deal to make any money through podcast and apparently you can expect to make around $18 for a 30-second and $25 per thousand a thousand reasons for a 60-second at that level of sponsorship deal you would need around a thousand downloads per episode if you have a weekly podcast so you have $4,000 a month and if you're putting a 60-second ad in there for $25 per thousand views that would make you run about $100 a month four episodes, how hard is it to get a thousand downloads per month it's a lot harder to get a thousand podcast downloads per month then it has to get a thousand YouTube views per month because it's different soul solo on YouTube but if it starts then it's the top 20% of podcast in the world that get on average more than $1,000 per episode please A friend of mine as an example my house magazine started her own podcast around 5 months ago there will be a link to that in the description and on average baskets round about 400 to 500 downloads per episode this is not bad at all especially considering she started 5 months ago and had a zero audience when she started so she didn't have the unfair advantage that I did when starting my own podcast for example news about it on YouTube that will really help the podcast bro and I'm pretty sure that in the next six months she'll be silly getting to a point where she can quite easily make $100 a month from her podcast 3 out of 5 stars because it's hard but not as hard as Maybe monetizing on YouTube or you have this minimum threshold and funding maintenance well it's not really passive income because you do have to keep on making podcast episodes because the brain deals were associated with that but again once you stop once you know how to be a podcaster it's easier to continue going once you've already consulted as is the case with most things and sometimes of Maintenance of the podcast I'm going to give that to stawski me and my brother have a podcast about $625 per week from the podcast overall from brandiland from a membership to become an affiliate marketer means that you are selling other people's products but you're getting a percentage of sales from 48% of affiliate marketers globally on $20,000 a year which is $1,660 a month. At all like people doing very well with affiliate marketing a role so how hard is it to get started with affiliate marketing basically you can just sign up to an affiliate program like Amazon Associates so Amazon have their own affiliate program which I think is probably the biggest in the world and then once you have your little special links you can post those on your website or Twitter or and social media or whatever and if people buy the product through your on-site by any product on Amazon floor-length you'll get like some tiny percentage of the sales so pretty easy to get stuff but how hard is it to make $100 a month I'll be pretty good I wasn't nearly as much as 5% off is like two or three percent conversion rates are a people visiting the Thing versus people actually buying the product of a physical thing that's a that's a 1% you would need 8000 Google website or whatever to make $100 a month Authority and whatever space you're in got your serve organic taking in traffic a few other affiliate programs that I'm part of that one of them is skillshare who you can get $7 in affiliate commission just but I think so if you wanted to make $100 a month or Affiliates you need 15 people every month to sign up for skill share with your affiliate link saying how hard is it to get 15 people a month to sign up with your audience if you have your own puzzle still try like I do have like nine of them and so if I want to make money through skillshare affiliates play so somebody will say that description and then that will be needing some affiliate income from skillshare for this video five star we will talk about on this channel the way you build an audience is bike racing useful content putting it for free on the internet once a week I'm doing this for at least 2 years if you just follow the three steps I guarantee Freddy's 2 years so we'll give that a 3.5 Star Racing but once you start making money from Affiliates and I should quite easy to maintain because especially if you have Evergreen content the sword that isn't reliable at current affairs of the latest news that people might search for over long. this becomes like River has to be reasonable passive income. If we look at me and my business these days from skillshare we make run about $11,000 per month in affiliate income which approximates around $2,750 per week about $450 a month from the Amazon UK store and a little bit more from the US and Canada or a download or an app I got you crazy at once and then you can send it multiple times because selling digital products doesn't usually have any cost associated with a few months ago and ended up making I think like $300,000 in the course of like a few weeks just because of the people around the world wanted to buy his icon pack so he put the work into creating the pack and now he's sending it. Who has made he says $700,000 from selling his website Tumblr themes since 2014 so you made the website themes for Tumblr sells them they make $700,000 on average over Olson since 2014 that's pretty cool I mean anyone can write an e-book what counts as a digital product so I'm going to give this a 2-star rating 2 out of 5 stars but I will say again money is an exchange of value so the thing that you're setting you have to be providing enough value to compensate it to make up for the price and that's often quite hard especially if you don't have any experience in this sort of failed to how hard is it to make $100 a month but it's a whole different ballgame trying to get people to actually go by your icon settle by your Apple buy a website because the market around this stuff is so competitive like you have to be genuinely really good to get people to buy your stuff and the way you get people to pay you money for something is that you identify a problem that they have you solved that problem in any charge money for it and if you can do those three things then you know I would say that easy to make $100 a month but it's very doable to make $100 a month just genuinely have to have something that solves a pain point the other people willing to pay for so we're going to give this a 3 out of 5 stars to make $100 a month selling digital products and finally take two out of five stars because usually you do have to maintain your product a little bit but it's often easier to do like it's much easier to maintain a productive than creating a product online course online courses are in video format in fact this whole video so long it could basically been an entire online course I need to know how to do video so you could fill it online course on your iPhone or Android phone on the side Pope to the phone case something again and don't get a reason people pay for it is it the course is actually good you can avoid having to charge for your online courses by using a website like skillshare Emma 2019 just released my new Online files called productivity for creators how to start a successful side hustle where I teach you the ins and outs of how you can create your own side Hustle Lincoln's video description will get 30% off the annual skillshare premium membership does I should really good deal I pay Pesco Sarah I've been paying for it for years even after I start teaching on it because it's genuinely a fantastic place I'd like the nine that I've got there are three around productivity now like the fundamentals of productivity that should have plenty of equation which is how I think of productivity and productivity I have to and how you can study for exams if you're in school if you got any good play people really had a free trial if you'll share then you can still use that offer that if you wanted the first a thousand people to hit the bank and video description you'll get 30% of the premium membership you can check out my costume is pretty good because you can teach things on skillshare without directly having to charge for them which is why I love putting my clothes and it's kind of like having something on Netflix and not have to pay directly for the product anyone can upload a coffee filter provided it needs certain quality requirements and so it's a lot easier than having to make your own website and create your own courses platform and all that kind of stuff so pretty easy to make $100 a month from teaching online courses depends if you're going down the skill share rooms then to make $100 a month on skillshare you need run about 1700 minutes of watch time which is 28 hours of watchtime so if you have a 1 hour coffin skillshare you need 28 students to take that cloth every month and watch it roughly very broadly speaking and that will give you round about $100 a month at least at the base of my fingers over the last like 2 years of being on skillshare is very easy to get 28 people watching it because people already know like and trust you hopefully and so they'll wash yourself and give you a short because you've already built at Goodwill with them for the night again that I think about Coach are the top form is that they have like their own algorithm so the goods Risin to the top if you genuinely have a really really really good clothes and you put it on skillshare then even if you don't have an audience there is still a high chance of it because it actually good and people watch a lot of people recommend and give a high ratings able to rise to the top and it will start getting recommended to people skillshare homepage / search for a specific charge $100 for a course and then if you do that you just need one sale every month so how hard is it to get one person a month to buy a course well again if it's good more and more money is being spent on online education specially with all pandemic stuff but if you have a valuable skill that you can teach I think horses are one of the best and easiest easiest one of the best ways of making passive income because it's fun to create course you can teach stuff you don't need that many technical is like making a website or anything like that just shoveling snow share and then people can take your course and then on the internet and like you know it's just cool overall and the nice thing is that once you made the course and once you're making $100 a month permit maintaining that level is actually quite easy to out of 5 stars because generally you don't need to update Aquos that often and you can do that once in a while and you just need to make sure you're getting a reasonable amount of traffic to it and hopefully that traffic will grow over time these days round about 60,000 to $65,000 per month in purely passive income like I literally do nothing for myself eyeglasses on that made them other than replace comments and that's like $60,000 a month in passive income dollars per week and this makes up the bulk of the $27,000 a week that this business card degenerates in purely passive income or Community model again this is generally a bad idea unless you have audience like everything becomes easier when you have an existing Audience by creating content that has been valuable over a long. Of time very consistent. Williams nose likes trust you and so when you say hi to my patreon then some people are likely to do that thing the other way of doing it's like raising a value proposition that is so compelling that people would be willing to pay for a community like service fullest if we use patreon as an example my friend Hannah witton who's the YouTuber she's got round about 600,000 subscribers in YouTube I think she has around 600 626 last time I check which means she's making somewhere between 2000 and 5000 lb or like 3,000 $7,000 per month in passive income from this audience but it's like 600 people out notice of 600 the one in a thousand of us subscribers have signed up to a patreon so pretty you know if those dots are true across the board and they kind of or if you look at my develop picture on as well you need a big audience to make a significant amount of money for patreon again to sort of depend on how much exactly what value of a paid membership as my friend and Lord who runs a website called Nest labs and they have a paid membership Community which is $5 a month and she started this and he just wrote a hundred blog post over a hundred working days and built up an audience that's that in March 2020 when she launched a membership she had some paying members for initially and I think last month she just passed $100,000 a year in annual recurring Revenue which is pretty from something that started less than 2 years ago so how easy is it to start a membership program that you very easy with this a one-star because on some kind of membership what about you to do that for me know once you're making $100 a month and that's a lot easier to maintain it because the way the membership communities work is provided you keep showing up and providing value people have already signed up for the thing so it's not too hard to maintain that level of support that you're referring them to this business we have a membership Community for a part-time YouTuber Academy for the alumni we make roughly 2,800. from the membership Community if we run like three or four events per week along with like twice a day co-working events of zoom and we have lots of stuff going on so about $2,800 a week is pretty good for a membership Lancome is creating a business that sells goods or services and then automating or delegating aspects of that business so that the income that you generate from it is reasonably cuz if this is about in the 4-Hour Work week weather a little businesses that you can make Goodwill selling a service and then you can delegate out so it was made and intelligent ways to make income passive so again using my friend all your as an example on his YouTube channel he talks about his $1000000 Shopify store he designs manufactures and sells these really cool vegan leather clip desk accessories and bags and mouse pads and that kind of stuff and this was loaded work in setting up but now he's got a team of three other people that manage the business and so he spends proportionately less of his time running that business and so it's sort of passive income for him even though these days he still does spend around the week maintaining things equal if you're going down the service road to I'm a better friend who runs Instagram and Facebook ads marketing agency where he has clients who pay him some of that I think a few hundred dollars per month to manage that Facebook and Instagram but then it's sort of automated and he's got a Miranda and he's using things like that. To automate aspect of that business so that each month he has to do a very small amount of actual work to keep it ticking along to be the different ways of generating passive income from a kind of goods service-based business starts with the stuff to get started we going to give this a 4 to 5 star rating because the guy you need to create a business and it quite hard to make a business that genuinely provide value you have to be able to provide body and he was hot like it's not as easy as making an account of stuff platform two things money and you actually have to give out he's people with it than anything maintenance annoying for generating passive income is to build an app or website was some kind of software product that you can offer either as a one-off or more likely these days as a subscription service and there's a whole category this costs a software-as-a-service website packers.com Dairy like literally hundreds of examples of people who have built software businesses that are making passive income and they share the revenue numbers and they tell you how they go Startin to give you the tips in fact I was recently interviewed on an episode of the Indie hackers podcast which is really cool cuz I've been listening to and I was interviewed around the concept of something online course like the part-time user experience when I was at University I made a website called B Master ninja and you Cape Cod ninja so it was a question bank for medical applicants applying to medical school to help them do well in the admissions test and this was something that me and my brother coated completely from scratch and I both know how to code we were young and so he works over the summer of 2015 to make these things happen ending in year one we met $10,000 in India five last year it was around $25,000 from FEMA and dresser it's pretty good money but it was a lot of work to set these things up I have to actually build it takes a lot of work and it's very hot but it's a little different kettle of fish so we're going to give that. As for the nice thing is like with everything maintenance is little bit easier so we're going to give that a 3-star rating videos that I've made around tips for entrepreneurs how I go started creating my businesses with the code for the stuff that's only play thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in this video"

I told me about why you should have a personal website wide something I recommend for everyone 2nd legal talk about how to actually create your own personal website how to get a demain and which platforms to use both free and paid options we'll talk about once you go to a personal website what the hell do you actually do with it how can you make it work for you in a nice way so that's not into it about why you should have a personal website you know everyone has Twitter and Instagram and like the website effects of having a personal website instead of using myself as an example because I'm quite far ahead in the journey continues my housemate Sheen who started her own personal website and just under a year ago and it had all of these benefits in one form or another benefit one is it already helps you develop your own ideas so it would seem for example if she cares a lot about women empowerment and enjoys documenting Life as a PhD student writing a weekly blog posts you just automatically become a better writer and a better communicator and she's better at developing her ideas medicine seemed quite a soft kind of benefit like the person development site if you don't if you don't like naturally into that thing so it benefit number to of writing online is that actually really helps you in terms of your professional life as well as examples 2020 and has been blogging more or less every week and lost her when she was applying to lots of jobs they were quite a few interviews that she had where the people on the interview panel had come across a website that Google the name and they found a Blog and it away the website acted as a sort of Honor do you think I'm interested in that thing myself let's talk about it and he says whatever professional field you're in you can pretty much guarantee that your prospective employer is going to be Googling you in if you have your own website yeah you can put your best foot forward and you can start creating will be possibilities for someone to be like oh my God you're interested in this thing as well I'm interested into let's have a chance about it benefits of having a website that gives you lots of connections example I've made friends from around the world through my website for my YouTube channel the process of switching against. In less than a year ago she's had people from all around the world reach out to her because they read something interesting on site antidote you know you're interested in. Poverty and things like that. Let's get in touch let's have a bit of a chat about it oh you're interested in improving access to education this is actually a charity that I'm looking for the does the same thing that's talked about it and threw that she's made a lot of interesting connections more some of these connections have led to benefit number for which is that when you have a personal website you expose yourself to lots of in a weird way you expose yourself a lot of interesting opportunities and because running people around the world and found she invoked post through website she's been invited to write the publication's she's been featured in little Publications she's been invited on podcast interviews and she's been invited as a speaker on all sorts of these and a global Health event type things which is exactly the sort of causes that she has about you are a regularly you can have a lot more impact than you would if you're not on the internet having a presence on the Internet is the modern-day equivalent of just being very good at networking and the analogy that I like is that it's like back in the day you imagine like if you just lived in a single Village and you never text with anyone outside your village the amount of impact you can have a little bit but if you're the sort of person back in the day who would every weekend you'd visit a different village to be making friends and saying hello to people and having that's what a person just automatically exposes themselves to a lot more interesting opportunities and and also have a far bigger impact on the world the modern-day equivalent of just being confined to a little village where the only people that you're really going to interact with our people that you meet at work or school University and maybe if you go to a conference or networking event maybe around to someone but having that website that you irregularly massively expensive essential impact of your work. Articles that use writing about women empowerment event to Shared like hundreds of times it would be almost impossible to have that level of impact even I don't like that early stage without using the internet in something Euclid you want to take things further on your blood becomes particularly popular or you graduate to be having a YouTube channel again this video could potentially be seen by tens if not hundreds of thousands of people around the world has far more impact than I'll ever have sitting in my little village and finally benefit number 6 of having a personal website is that you can monetize it if you want probation be the main reason for having a personal website because generally you know it takes a solid few years of doing this. Regularly before you actually make money from it but it's definitely a possibility and I've got lots of YouTuber friends again in different places around the world who I'm making 6 to 7 figures a year you know it like a hundred thousand to a million dollars plus per year from their website which is also insane thing that happens if you stick with this for very long time and over already play personal website that you write on regular day is that an act as a Serendipity vehicle as my friend David Platt Electrical it is like you know even while you're sleeping your work is out there on the Internet or whatever it is that you're writing about is out there and being my people if they think it's good it's like having the army of robotic workers whose like working for you in like spreading new message far and wide and that has all these benefits of we just talked about so let's say your soul question number two is well how do you actually create a website that you need to create a website number one you need a platform and number to you need to Domaine let's start by talking about the platform the thing that host your website so for example you might have heard of Squarespace or WordPress or you might have seen an ad for wix.com we might have heard of things that I use could ghost basically hundreds of website platforms out there some of them afraid most of them and they will let you create a website in some capacity time I'm going to give you a list of three options to choose from that I would personally recommend number one is a totally free option and that is substack substack is a great place to write a kind of email newsletter it's not quite the same thing as a website like if I would have thought a website on sub stock I would create an account and then I would have my website being Ali abdaal don't stub stack.com but if it is totally free it's very easy to get started it automatically has the email new and so even if you have from scratch and you just have your friends and family signing up to and use that that you can probably get like 10 subscribers to begin with and then every week when you write something it automatically sent it out to those 10 people and you go the little URL upstart.com my book post which you can then share on Twitter or Instagram won't link to drive more traffic to your thing the problem is that it's not really a website s'more newsletter already have your own demesne and if you want to take this website thing seriously I would hug you highly recommend paying for service people about websites and there's an issue about paying for something a series of people one category is like I was when I was 13 I ate Pakistani boy my mom controls my spending I don't have a credit card account spend any money online without my mom's permission or I physically don't have the money for me it was all of the above when I was younger story of I literally cannot pay for anything therefore I need a free option and I used to spend years searching for free options to start a website back when I was like 13 14 years old if you're in that position don't worry about it we'll be there I know how you feel I know how Asian parents are like you just making accountants up stack and don't tell your parents about it these days most people who can quite easily afford to pay for my posting but choose not to do it because of some absolutely ridiculous notion that everything on the internet should be these are the people who are like you know spend $30 twenty quite on a night out buying alcohol or like you know getting takeaways at least once a week and people who still feel that oh my God pennies per month for an app on my iPhone that I use every day that's like a bad investment this is genuinely the sort of investment that can change your life and the good news is the kind of options you have this or not that expensive so there are two options that I would recommend on the page route computer and you don't really know much about computers and you know for a comfortable with navigate to computer like my housemate Sheen you should just use Squarespace this video a video of mine like 2 years ago just use Squarespace all of the things that you need if you pay for a year upfront which kind of good take the website you'll get a free. Come to my name but you can just use but if you know a little bit about the pieces the option that I would personally recommend is cold ghost ghost is a $9 a month really really good web hosting solution it's why venues my own website since 2016 for the last five years I have to do my website today is still hosted on ghost and unlike makes with the founder of go see the pool guy something to be on the YouTube channel they're really great company either entirely remote it's open source software and if you pay for ghost Pro which is the that's just $9 a month and it's very very easy to get I have a cheeky if anything can the video description and goes to Whole Foods. L a i got a bit of a kick back and forth at the feel free to not use my favorite thing I can really care less I don't need the extra Pennies from Heaven couldn't think if we're being honest because because it's absolutely amazing and overall which have a platform you use I've given you three options substitute Squarespace and ghosts they're all pretty good whatever option you choose don't overthink it one of the biggest mistakes you can make when it comes to creating website it's thinking that the platform mattress put pretzel webflow or Wix or Squarespace of goes to like a hundred different solutions spending Aegis like researching guess it really does not matter like no one cares what platform your website is hosted on the important thing is a that you have a website in the first place and be that you decent content for every week. Gives you 99.9% of the value in the website these final 0.1% comes from choosing the right platform and SEO optimization Richmond ghost post me but feel free to Squarespace for which is more expensive but slightly easier to use or feel free to use substack if you need a free option now the demesne is like, like, like facebook.com thanks to your website platform so initially when you make an account on ghost you might start with Ali Abdullah. Goes to the Ohio that would be your url that's not very pretty isn't it to someone hate it's not very proud to be like you can do it you can buy a domain and that cost around about $10 per year is a very cheapest is less than a dollar a month it is price of coffee is it's like buying a coffee every four months from like Starbucks that's how much it cost like $10 a year and then you'll income that to mean to not raise up. and now you can say check on my website and that just sounds kind of cool if you're down for paying for a. Call Moore. Credit UK over. Whatever the man name the service I use these days is Google domains it's easy to use for a nice if you wanted for free you are blocked because you can't get a Man for free unless you're a student and if you're a student you can use namecheap to get a free. Amy demaine. Me to means they know as production is. Comes before personal blog very reasonable to have an ultimatum I've been using them for the last 10 years for my domain hosting I have only recently switch to Google the main again it doesn't really matter what the main registrar you use the two that I recommend are named sheep and the Google domains and now you have a website and is taking maybe 5 or 10 minutes to set up this is all very nice and straightforward how to use how do I do it I sent her I said go to squarespace.com and you'll figure it out and she said that she already hated me for doing that because it felt like I was throwing her in the deep end but it's like you know the whole point of these website solutions that is very easy to get started you can literally go space.com click the button and it says really really obvious how to make website making website hard if you haven't done it before in like 2005 when I was making my first website yes it was hard it sounds like it's like piss easy to make a website you literally just go and squares basil goes take the sign up button and to your email and password and you literally done it's so so easy if you haven't tried it yet 100% yes I get there are other freeway still website you could use that length at defy you could use Heroku you could open sores goes what price check month. If you know what I'm talkin about their then you know that this video if you're also this would a person that got hung up on whether you want to use another fire Heroku a ghost with this and not this is all you know the sort of person who actually writes anything once a week on the website so I would say at least for most people are spoken to a boring that camp of being computer nerds who are focused on how can maximize my ability to create a website for free those people who focusing on the wrong things focus on creating content everything and Publishing a good rather than quibbling about whether he's netlify Roku for whatever website how easy it is to make website what the hell do you do with your website how do you actually make your website good I got this is a lot more straightforward than people make it out to be your website only needs three pages it needs an about page and needs a contact page and it needs a Blog literally that is all you need your homepage can literally just be your about page or it can be like a blog post it doesn't matter and then once you go do set up with again only takes about 20 minutes you don't need to overthink to your about page or your contact page the real objective at this point now is to write a blog post and try and do it every week once a week I think you could Caden's it gets you into the habit of writing that gets into the habit of publishing and gets into the habit of showing your work on the internet at this point people usually ask well what do I write about you can basically write about whatever you want the only bar I have for like what I mean about his could this potentially be useful to at least one other person in the world if I'm writing about my bowel habits that's probably not particularly useful to anyone there for I-10 note to write blog post about my bowel habits but that's how I read a book and I'm like huh this is a pretty good book if you think from it I would write a blog post about the inside to learn from this but let's I listen to a podcast I say I'm going through University and I'm under no first-year medical student would be very reason with me to write what the experience of a first-year medical student is like would that be useful to anyone else yeah probably it would be useful to people who are thinking of going into med school SAU election you're doing a PhD hope you to write about your experiences of being a PhD yes it would because essentially other people who might want to do that would be interested in what is the date today experience of doing a PhD actually like a nice quote from Gary vaynerchuk today off and come back to it which is document don't create like creating content of the concept of that I should really hard it feels like a big deal but if you just think about documenting the stuff that you're doing anyway it becomes very easy to find ideas of things to write about if I was starting a blog from scratch and I had zero audience nothing at all I like I'd be like you know this is my morning routine and this is why doesn't my morning routine here is an article that I read about asking this is what make what I made me think about it was a book that I read about why and here's a quick summary of the book in a link to the book with an Amazon that got some sort of stuff I'd be writing about and I'll be exploring any other I'll pick that I personally enjoyed so Xin for gunpla super into women empowerment and a ratification. Poverty and improving access to grow vegetation that's cool to write articles about that I'm more into like Tech and lye content creation and like Coastal development and like you know how can we improve charisma skills and so I'll be writing about those sorts of topics that I care about but the main thing is that once you set a goal of Life publishing something once a week especially if you haven't like an email newsletter associated with that you just end up finding things to write about like there are a zillion the body is out there you just need to pick one of them right about it publish it and just do this every week for the next two years I can pretty much guarantee that your life will change in an interesting way and also the question of what do I write about the next question people always ask as well how will my stuff be seen let's say our right you know blog post about why I have a fake tan in my desk I can talk about how I read a book by Richard Wiseman, 59 seconds about how having Greenery on your desk and encourages creativity I could write a blog post about that no one would ever find that thing these days is very simple when you write a blog post on Twitter or Instagram or LinkedIn or Facebook or wherever you have social media everyone has ocean videos in some capacity and if you don't you're doing it wrong you should have an account with social networking a lot of stuff you show support me through Linkedin if you're into the whole professional side of things cuz Nicktoons right but want to write a blog post you can literally just post a link on Facebook link on Instagram post screenshot on Instagram that's how she in Wendy Williams at the start got to the point where her blood was starting to get Rita's she just posted about it on Instagram she had a few hundred followers Instagram other times friends and family and through that people found the blog and then every time she was writing a blog post she would post about it on Instagram unlink on LinkedIn you put a soda professional audience that cares about this other stuff Instagram is more like her people caring about her life because they have family and friends and then through those those like you know 10 or 20 people here and they're reading an article one of those people within someone else and say Hey you read this person's article is already the way that people find your blog find a find a website isn't already through search engine optimization these days maybe used to be in the 2005 but not usually the most personal websites your stuff is because you shared it on social media on your own to your own friends and family and then someone there who's resonated with your thing has Freddy a little bit wider and yeah I just thought it was going to be pissed off because it's probably not very good if you haven't had an experience of writing your puppy but that's okay like this is the sort of thing that improves over time and certainly had to start when I started my YouTube channel and my blog no one was reading and no one was watching I would get like 23 video views on the YouTube video another time it's because my YouTube videos one very good but over time as I made more of them I got better at making YouTube videos I go best friend writing blog post and a death will build this audience over time so if you worried about no one's going to read myself don't worry about it cuz it takes time but also make sure you're sharing on social media cuz it's a very easy way for people to find one of your how does a few other frequently asked questions I opened when it comes to the website thing I asked how do I make my website look pretty and I would say don't worry about it the design does not matter if he is Ghost if you use Squarespace it's going to be pretty by default add these days when it comes to a personal website the Aesthetics of the website is absolutely not the thing people care about people care about the content they care about the ideas to care about the writing its radio about the writing as long as your design does not get in the way of the right thing you don't need to worry about the disease you can just pick a default theme Squarespace there free ghost has loaded free templates for the first four years my website I was just using a free Ghost theme the default one and it look pretty good I get messages from people being like Oh my God your websites are pretty how did you design it free theme that just comes with ghost when you use goes to do website platform these days I use a custom-designed themed but I've been doing the website thing in the content thing for 5 years at this point so do not worry about design at Old focus on the content SEO do not worry about search engine optimization it is very unlikely that your personal website will be getting any reasonable traffic from search engine optimization instead focus on writing good stuff and sharing it on Twitter or whatever social media you have and if it resume people the kind of organic sharing this of your articles is one lead to more website traffic compared to you worrying about SEO don't worry about it so it's a sore thing you can worry about three years further down the line. How do I monetize my website again don't worry about it yes mother on this is. Unless you've been writing weekly for at least one to two years you don't need to worry about monetization in the slightest but like what if I'm scared to put myself out there a personal website trust me I've been there in 2016 I had all these fears myself I've been wanting set up a website for like years of that point and I never did it cuz I was just too scared but I found the solution and that is old in this video over here which talks about how Rising online made me video I share how I go over the fear of putting myself out there on the incident at how ultimately my personal website ended up completely changing my life so check that video of that thank you so much for watching"
